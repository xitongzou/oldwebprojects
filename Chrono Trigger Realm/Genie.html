<SMALL>B325-7765 "ONLY TECHS DO DAMAGE TO ENEMIES"</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>37E5-54A6: "ADDS 300 TO MOST STATS BUT NO PERMANENT EFFECT"</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>5765-54A6 "HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 2ND SAVE SLOT"</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>5765-54D6 "BLACK OUT AFTER LOADING A SAVE"</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>5765-54O6 "THE GAME NEVER TURNS ON"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>9DAA-7765 
"DOES WEIRD THINGS DURING BATTLE"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>5683-7765 "SPEEDBAR NEVER 
GOES DOWN"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>B621-7765 "WEIRD STUFF HAPPENS IN BATTLE"- Yours 
and the enemy's damage points are screwed up, sometimes they take 0 and 
sometimes they just kill them.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>9DB1-7765 "MESSED UP SCREEN"- 
&nbsp; Leave GG off until you go into battle, then turn it on.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>9DB3-7765 "BATTLE GOES HAYWIRE"- Go into a battle and put your 
controller down. The game goes haywire they do things without you telling it. If 
&nbsp; you want to take back control turn the GG off.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>9DB5-7765 "MORE WEIRD BATTLES"- In battle it looks like it crashes 
but just press A. When you use an attack, it looks like you glide and when you 
do a Tech you don't move your arms. Your characters don't do the victory dance. 
Game may freeze sometimes.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>0023-77A5 "REPEATING DAMAGE"- 
Makes damage repeat. Turn GG off after 3 times or the game might 
black-out.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>5444-54D8 "PURPLE TEXT ON MAP SCREEN"</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>0444-54D8 "ORANGE TEXT ON MAP SCREEN"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>3EBF-5767 
"TRANSPORTER"- Go into a town or someplace and leave. You will be transported to 
a different part of the map. Only problem is sometimes it puts you some where 
you are not supposed to go and you can not move.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>3BBE-7765 
"MIXED UP CHARACTERS"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>366E-7765 "GET LEVEL UPS AND ITEMS 
AFTER A BATTLE"- Use a Tech, you win the battle, and you get lots of level 
&nbsp; ups, lots of items, and other weird stuff!</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>7838-7765 
"INVINCIBLE"- A great invincible code - any enemy dies with one blow, even when 
they attack and your party gets healed after the battle.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>24A0-5700 "INVINCIBLE TO MOST ATTACKS AND MAGICS"- Strong enemies may 
kill your some of your party members but not the leader of the group.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>F5A0-54A1 "9999 DAMAGE"- 9999 damage to everybody (physical or 
magic). Use with the invincible code 24A0-5700. When characters raise levels 
when both codes are active the character will be at the highest level and 
attributes and go down in attribute after next raise. When the code is not 
active the next level raised will be normal.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>3365-5D00 "KILL 
ONE ENEMY TO WIN THE BATTLE"- For some enemies there is no need to fight. One 
disadvantage is that you only get the exp. for the enemy you killed.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>F2B0-54A6 "HEAL PARTY TO A CERTAIN OR ABOVE NORMAL HP"- Use this code 
at the menu screen.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>3F65-EF06 "GET SOME ITEMS JUST BY GOING 
TO THE ITEMS SCREEN"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>FF65-5F0F "ENEMIES REAPPEAR AFTER A 
BATTLE"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>5E2A-5F01 "RANDOM BATTLE EFFECT"- You may get a 
weapon from an enemy that gives an item, have your HP raised to 999 at level 1 
or learn most or all techs after a battle. The effect depends on the time period 
and location. When using this code, let the game freeze before choosing an 
attack command, then turn the GG off and back on. Before the game freezes again 
kill all of the enemies.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>336A-ED09 "STRANGE"- After you start 
a new game, go to Guardia Forest with Crono only. Then go to the bird with the 
bell and fight the 2 beetles. Do not touch the other creatures. When in battle, 
the game will freeze. Turn the GG off and back on. After killing one beetle, run 
away from battle. When the screen messes up turn the GG off again, then turn it 
back on when you hear the running away sound. The normal screen will also be 
messed up so go to the menu screen and exit. If the trick worked, Crono's stats 
will have changed and there will be 6 cats at Crono's house. If you go upstairs 
at his house Crono's mom will wake him up again.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>9DAB-7765 
"INFINITE M.P. LUCCA"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>3BC4-7765 "FLEEING ENEMIES"- This will 
make most moving monsters in battle try to run away from you in battle! This 
will not work on stationary monsters and Bosses! Some monsters will start to 
fight you if you attack while they are trying to run away...Some monsters will 
glitch the game like Winged monkeys. Although this is not a perfect code it can 
be very helpful.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>DCF3-7765 "INVISIBLE"- You and your enemies 
become invisible in battle! The battle continues but you just can't see yourself 
and the enemy...</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>568F-7765 "WEIRD ITEMS"- It's hard to 
explain, but if you go into battle and try to use a Tech. against the monsters a 
message will appear saying..."You have obtained (either) x1 "Lightning" or 
"Rovoke" Then, all the monsters instantly get destroyed (can freeze game, 
rarely) and you are stuck in eternal battle...You can "run away". If you are in 
a place where you can't, you'll just have to reset the game. I believe this is a 
good start for an "item" code... After careful experimenting, I have concluded 
that you are actually getting Techs..."rovoke" = "Provoke"</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>B323-7765 "INVINCIBILITY"- This will make you and the enemies 
invincible in battles! It works for both your party and the enemies, so turn the 
GG off when you attack and turn it on when the enemies attack you.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>B623-7765 "9999 DAMAGE"- Anything that hits will do 9999 Damage, 
whether it is an attack or tech. This code works for both your party and the 
monsters. If you equip Crono with the haste cap he can attack with Confuse 4 X 
9999 damage!</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>B625-7765 "EVADE INCREASES"- This code makes it 
really hard to attack monsters and vice-versa. The chances are 1 to 10 of 
getting hit! This does not work with Techs though.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>812C-7765 
"INSTANT VICTORY"- The moment you try to do anything in battle, you start doing 
your victory dance...However, doing this will result in a "blackout".</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>0738-7765 "DEATH"- This is the coolest code that needs work so far... 
It instantly destroys all enemies (even some bosses)! when you try to do 
anything..."tech" and "attack"... Problem is it always glitches...You are stuck 
in an "eternal battle".</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>EEDF-7767 "PLAY ALONE"- Here is a 
code that needs working on...This code will allow you to play alone! It's cool 
only to see Magus in the screen! Problem is it freezes during combat...</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>EEFE-7405 "INVISIBLE ON FIGHT"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>B323-74A5 "0 
HP"-&nbsp; Every attack on enemy or companion, hurts Crono by "0" HP.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>B323-7465 "NUMBER OF ATTACKS = AMOUNT OF DAMAGE"- Regular attacks = 
1HP, Double attacks/Double TECHs = 2HP, Triple TECHs = 2HP</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>B323-7405 "9999 DAMAGE"- Every attack on enemy or companion = 9999 
HP. This code hits 9999 every time.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>39B0-EFD4 "LET ME 
THROUGH"- You cannot walk some places.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>AA34-7DD5 "WIERD"- 
Enemies disappear instead of die, which results in Eternal Battle. Crono takes 
ALL the HP adds&lt;cure&gt;, and subtracts &lt;attacks&gt; for 
companions.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>AA34-7D05 "WIERD2"- Eternal Battle, 3rd person 
invincible, 1 hit kills 1st person, REVIVE revives 1st person to full HP, 1st 
person dies when enemy misses, 3rd person gets hurt when certain enemies are 
attacked, 2nd person dies when revived or cured, CURE doesn't effect 3rd 
person.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>AA34-7D65 "WIERD3"- Party is invincible, eternal 
battle.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>AA34-7FD5 "SWAPPING EFFECTS"- This code is just 
screwed up, if the 2nd person gets hit, the 1st person dies, if the 2nd person 
is cured, he/she sometimes dies. There are many other things too like an Eternal 
Battle.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>AA34-7FAD "WIERD4"- 1st person invincible, attacks 
against the 2nd person take 4 HP, attacks against the 3rd person only take 8 HP, 
Eternal Battle.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>AA34-7F0D "WIERD5"- 1st invincible, 2nd+3rd 
die with 1 hit, 1st cannot be cured, Eternal Battle.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>AA34-746D "INVINCIBLE" Everyone is invincible, Eternal 
Battle.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>AA39-7D05 "INVINCIBLE"- Enemies, and you are 
invincible.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>"GET OUT OF ETERNAL BATTLE" There is way to get 
around these Eternal Battles, but you have to kill the enemy twice, so it will 
only work if it takes 1 hit to kill it. What you do is make 2 characters attack 
the same person, (click very quickly) then when the 1st person kills it for the 
1st time, it will just disappear, then the 2nd person will attack, and kill it 
again. Then it will go away. This is the only way to get by Eternal Battle, and 
this method doesn't work for every Eternal Battle.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>EEE3-7765 
"DECREASING DAMAGE"- For the first few rounds of battle the damage that is dealt 
to you increasingly goes down.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>DBF3-7765 "STRANGE BATTLES"- 
You and your enemies turn into a jumbo letters and numbers and all that. But, 
the good part about this code is that sometimes you win/lose a battle 
automatically. One flaw that is that Techs do no damage. Also, you lose 
automatically more then you win automatically.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>A523-7765 
"ASSORTED DAMAGE"- Sometimes you take 0, sometimes you take normal amounts, 
ignore disappearing characters...</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>3E6F-5767 "CAN'T MOVE 
DOWN"- Can't move down. Try to edit it to get it so that you can 
walk-through-walls in a down direction...</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>EE6F-D767 "PENDULUM 
SCREEN NEVER ENDS"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>8DA8-7765 "ROBO'S TECHS USE ALL 
MP"</SMALL> 
</p>
<P><SMALL>8DAB-7765 "INFINITE MP FROG"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>Try 7DA6-7765 if the 
first code doesn't work.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>7DAB-7765 "INFINITE MP

"CRONO = AYLA"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>DE6D-7D7D "CRONO = EPOCH?"</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>9DA6-7765 "1ST CHARCTER INFINITE MP"- Works only in battle 
mode.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>9DAB-7765 "2ND CHARACTER INFINITE MP"- Works only in 
battle mode.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>9DA8-77D5 "3RD CHARACTER INFINITE MP"- Works 
only in battle mode.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>AA34-7765 "TAKE ZERO DAMAGE"</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>B023-7765 "IMMUNE TO SOME ATTACKS AND SPELLS"- Halation, Some spells, 
and Critical Attacks do little or no damage.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>6623-7765 
"IMMUNE TO MOST ATTACKS AND SPELLS"- Enemies do 1 damage except Halation, Normal 
Attacks do nothing, Critical Attacks do 2 damage.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>EE23-7765 
"ENEMIES CAN BARELY HURT YOU"- Enemies can do no damage, Critical Attacks do no 
damage, and Everything else does 1 damage.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>2223-7765 "ERASES 
2ND SAVE GAME; ALL INVINCIBLE"- Erases 2nd Save game and all are invincible. 
These codes are not fully tested. May produce different results depending on the 
situation.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>B434-7765 "INVINCIBILITY 1"- Invincible! But, you 
have to run away after hidden enemies hit you.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>B424-7765 
"INVINCIBILITY 2"- It will make you invincible but if a monster throws you there 
is a possibility you might get stuck...</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>1438-7765 
"INVINCIBILITY 3"- It will make you invincible and if a monster hits you they 
all die!</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>A1EE-EFD9 "LEVEL 99 AFTER ONE BATTLE"- Get ready to 
tape your turbo-A button down. It says you get the normal amount of experience 
points, but you and all in your immediate party go to level 99! I suggest you 
save your tabs until after you do this so you can fill in what else you need 
done to your guys.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>FC23-7D65 "EVERY HIT KILLS, THIS INCLUDES 
YOU"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>EEC4-7DD5 "ENEMIES WON'T HIT YOU UNLESS VERY 
CLOSE"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>"MAGUS VS. MAGUS"</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>REQUIREMENTS: CT Walk Thru Walls Code (EEBO-EFA4)</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>1. Begin a new game or New Game +.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>2. Play 
normally until you get chased into the future and land in the Bangor 
Dome.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>3. Go thru Lab 16.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>4. Turn the Walk 
Thru Walls code on.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>5. Go thru Sewer Access to the Keeper's 
Dome.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>6. Walk thru the sealed doors and get the 
Epoch.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>7. Travel to 12000 B.C. and play the rest of the game 
normally...until you get Magus.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>8. When you get Magus and the 
Black Omen appears, go to the Denandoro Mts. and fight Masamune (sometimes he's 
already dead).</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>9. Go to Melchior's and fix the Masamune 
(don't try and walk out the door while they're working or the game will 
freeze).</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>10. Go back to 600 A.D. Magus' Castle will be 
there!</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>11. Go in with Magus in your party and see Magus vs. 
Magus!</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>EEB4-546B "SKIP EVENTS"- This code is very weird. It is a modified 
version of the code for the bad ending every time you go into a Truce Village 
house. Turn on the GG when it starts saying "Crono..." Then go down and talk to 
Crono's Mom. She will give you the chance to name Lucca but you will only get a 
black screen instead of the name screen. Press Start to go on from this point. 
Then go straight upstairs and go back down. You have about a 50/50 chance of 
seeing Crono's Mom sitting in her chair. If she is, then when you come up to her 
she will say something like "Crono, I heard you were going to be executed." This 
means you skipped ahead into the game. The save menu name is now Forward to The 
Past. You only have Crono, but the events are the same as if you had gone 
through the game to that point except the men are still guarding Lucca's 
machine. It certainly is weird and there are many glitches, but it might be 
modified. Also if you keep it on, you may see the bad ending in a building in 
Truce.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>6666-7765 "TECHS ARE NOT LISTED ON TECH SCREEN BUT 
STILL WORK"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>FF67-7765 "LOWERS LUCCA'S MAX HP WHEN SHE USES 
TECHS"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>DC67-7765 "CAN'T USE TECHS"</SMALL>

DISAPPEARING"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>A523-7765 "CRITICAL HITS DO 0 DAMAGE, ENEMIES 
DISAPPEAR INSTEAD OF DIE"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>AF23-7765 "ENEMIES DISAPPEAR WHEN 
KILLED WITH A WEAPON"- Enemies will die normally if you use a tech.</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>D069-7D7D "MARLE = FROG"- Marle's stats appear to be like Frog's 
stats.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>D169-7D7D "MARLE = MAGUS"- Marle's stats appear to be 
like Magus's stats. Note: For some reason, it may takes two entry's to get this 
code to work.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>D469-7D7D "MARLE = LUCCA"- Marle's stats appear 
to be like Lucca's stats.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>D769-7D7D "MARLE = ROBO"- Marle's 
stats appear to be like Robo's stats.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>D969-7D7D "MARLE = 
AYLA"- Marle's stats appear to be like Ayla's stats.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>DD69-7D7D "MARLE = CRONO"- Marle's stats appear to be like Crono's 
stats.</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>6E67-5F64 "DUMMY MUSIC #1"- Listen to a music clip "dummied" in the 
U.S. version of CT! Enter this code but leave the GG off until you are standing 
next to Death Peak on the 2300 A.D. map. Turn the GG on and enter Death Peak. 
The game will blackout but it will play the music. Note: May not work on all CT 
paks!</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>E367-5FA4 "DUMMY MUSIC #2"-Listen to another music clip 
"dummied" in the U.S. version of CT! To use it, go to the Forest Ruins in 1000 
A.D. (The blue pyramid next to Medina) and, with the GG on, enter that area from 
the map. The screen will go black but the music will play. Note: May not work on 
all CT paks!</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>8E67-5FA4 "DUMMY MUSIC #3"- Listen to yet 
another tune. To use this code, enter Zenan Bridge on the 600 A.D. map (It 
doesn't matter which side you go in from). A short music clip will play. (Is 
this really a dummy tune? Can it be heard anywhere in the normal game?) Note: 
May not work on all CT paks!</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>C43A-ED04 "SAVE ANYWHERE"- To 
use this code, walk into any area that has a save point. Walk on the save point. 
You will hear a ching. Touch the save point again and it won't ching. Move your 
character off the save point and check your save screen. You now can save your 
game anywhere! Go to any other area and you still will be able to save! You 
might see a few graphic glitches but if you turn the GG off they will disappear. 
And, even if you don't have this GG code entered you will still be able to save 
anywhere as long as you don't go in a room with a save point. You can even save 
your game in front of Lavos (when it changes the attack mode) and at the 
Programmer's Ending! Note: This code has been tested many times and no problems 
with it have been found.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>BC38-8F06 "WALK ANYWHERE ON MAP 
SCREEN"- While on the map you can move your characters anywhere. But, be careful 
because there is a chance that you might get stuck and can't move. Also, this 
code was tested with Crono leading the party. It may or may not work with other 
characters in the lead.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>0B60-7FA4 "PERFECT WALK THRU WALLS"- 
This WTW code will let you walk anywhere on the screen, in any area!</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>9BE7-77AB "TERRA CAVE VILLAGER REPLACES GASPAR"- Go to your character 
exchange screen (press X button) and you will see that a villager from Terra 
Cave is in the lower- left hand corner instead of Gaspar.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>9BE7-74AB "BALTHASAR REPLACES GASPAR ON CHARACTER EXCHANGE 
SCREEN"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>00E7-7FAB "MELCHOIR REPLACES GASPAR ON CHARACTER 
EXCHANGE SCREEN"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>22EC-ED60 "GAIN ALL TECHS AFTER ONE BATTLE"- 
After winning a battle all characters in your party will learn all their Techs 
(Including double and triple techs)! Go into battle with different people to get 
everybody's Techs.</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>0E6F-7767 "WALK THROUGH WALLS (UP ONLY)"- This code allows you to walk 
up anywhere. Problem is if you get stuck you are stuck for good!</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>EE6F-E767 "WALK THROUGH WALLS (LEFT ONLY)"- This code allows you to 
walk left anywhere. Problem is if you get stuck you are stuck for good! You may 
have to face North, press up against an object and walk sideways to the left. 
This code works in all areas.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>EEB0-EFA4 "WALK THROUGH WALLS 
(REVISED)"- Walk-thru walls almost anywhere on the screen. May not work in some 
areas. Use this code to avoid enemies and walk through sealed doors (like in the 
Bangor Dome). Unlike the previous code...This will only allow you to through 
places that are accessible! Skip half of the game by going to the Keeper's Dome 
and getting Epoch even before getting Robo in your party! Skipping areas can 
also be done in other parts of the game.</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>3CB5-5FD3 "SILVER PENDULUM AT TITLE SCREEN"- The pendulum at the title 
screen will be a silver color instead of gold.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>DEC0-5767 
"MOVING CHARACTERS ACT STRANGE"- The movements of some creatures is strange. 
Game might glitch when this code is used.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>DCCB-57FE "STRANGE 
NEW MUSIC AND SOUND FX"- Odd music and sound FX.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>00C0-57FE 
"MORE STRANGE MUSIC AND SOUND FX"- Like the above code but sounds 
different.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>0082-E707 "PLAY JET BIKE RACE AT TITLE SCREEN"- 
Instead of the title screen you will be racing Johnny. Switch the GG off to go 
to the saved game screen.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>FF34-5F0D "LESS CHARACTERS IN 
BATTLE"- Some enemies may not appear when the fight begins.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>4282-E707 "TIME WARP GRAPHICS AT TITLE SCREEN"- Instead of the 
pendulum title screen you will get the graphic from when your characters travel 
from era to era (Not using Epoch). Switch off the GG to go to the saved game 
screen.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>C3E6-EDA7 "WAVE BACKGROUND"- When you enter an area 
the background will wave back and forth kind of like the backgrounds that appear 
and disappear while you are fighting Lavos Core. Game might glitch if you keep 
switching areas.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>5DE6-ED67 "EARTHQUAKES"- When you enter an 
area the whole screen shakes.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>333B-EF00 "SKIPS EXP. AND G 
SCREENS AFTER A BATTLE"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>F76E-5F00 "CHARACTERS AUTOMATICALLY 
RUN AWAY"- Characters automatically run away when you enter a battle. You can 
even run away from bosses! One negative about this code is that it only seems to 
work if you start a new game&nbsp; (Or new game +).</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>7F67-5DD0 
"BEAT MONSTERS (EVEN BOSSES)"- Go into battle with the GG turned on. Notice that 
the HP numbers of your characters will be messed up and the game will act like 
it froze. Now turn the GG off and your party members will fall down as if they 
had died. The enemies will disappear and your characters will get back up. Then 
the game will continue as if you had beat the monsters. &nbsp; Works on bosses 
also! This code seems to work better then the one above.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>44E4-5F0D "STRANGE FX"- Strange FX. Saved game screen, controls and 
battles are messed up.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>3B65-54D8 "INVISIBLE CHARACTERS ON MAP 
SCREEN"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>4444-54D8 "YELLOW TEXT ON MAP"</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>1A6F-E400 "AUTOMATICALLY WIN A BATTLE"- Automatically win a battle! Go 
into a fight and as soon as one of your characters goes to attack the enemies 
will disappear and the game will continue normally.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>A1E2-E4A9 
"MORE GOLD AFTER BATTLE"- Get more gold after a battle. Amounts may vary 
depending on the monster(s). Some party members may jump to different places on 
the screen during the battle so use this code with the walk thru walls anywhere 
code in case your characters get stuck in a wall, tree or whatever.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>EE34-5D60 "ATTACKS DO MORE DAMAGE IN BATTLE"- Any character's attack 
does more damage. This code also works with techs but not magic.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>65B2-7760 "AFTER BATTLE GET ?"- Does strange things after a battle. 
You may get lots of exp. and just a few gold and tech points or you &nbsp; may 
get lots of gold and just a little exp. and tech points. If you fight an enemy 
that usually gives an item after a battle you might get lots of a different 
item. During the battle enemies might keep attacking over and over again so turn 
the GG off and back on when they stop. Try to keep the GG on most of the battle. 
This code may not do anything when fighting certain enemy groups. Try fighting 
large groups of enemies.</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>6CB5-5DD7 "SUPER SPRINT (UP ONLY)"- Your party will run very fast but 
in an up direction only. If you get stuck against a wall turn off the GG and do 
a regular sprint to free yourself.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>1BCD-5FA7 "FAST 
CHARACTERS"- Characters not in your party move very fast.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>A06E-7D07 "START A GAME ON LEVEL 0"- Instead of getting the normal 
saved game screen after the title screen you will get the one from the menu. 
Choose a slot and save. Then reset the game with the GG turned off. Use New Game 
+ on that save and Crono will begin with 0 of almost everything. No known useful 
effect for this code yet.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>22B4-546B "BAD ENDING" Leave the GG 
off until you enter a building in Truce 1000 AD. Turn the GG on and leave the 
building. When you see the map turn the GG off again. Now you will be watching 
the bad ending (The ending you normally get if killed by Lavos).</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>A2A4-E7BB "WALK ANYWHERE ON THE ZEAL MAP"- Have a saved game by 
Enhasa in Zeal 12000 BC. Once you do that, use this code. You will now be able 
to walk off the continent and move anywhere in the clouds. A neat but not very 
useful code.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>EE6D-7F8D "CRONO STARTS WITH 999 HP"- Begin a 
new game and Crono will start with a max. of 999 HP. When you first start he 
will only have 70/999 HP, so you will have to stay at an inn or heal yourself. 
(Has this code already been created?)</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>EE6F-54AD "GAME 
CONVERSATIONS"- Talk to anybody in the game. Then go to the menu screen and 
exit. Their conversation will repeat even if you are not near them. If you go to 
a different area, go to the menu screen and exit, you may get a conversation 
from a &nbsp; different part of the game. Graphics might glitch in some 
areas.</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>29BD-5F07 "TELEPORTER"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>Depending on what area you 
enter (or if you change areas) many things may happen like:</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>1. Get an ending.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>2. Get transported to an event 
in the game.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>3. Get transported to another area in the same 
era.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>4. Get transported to another era.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>5. 
Get transported to a map.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>6. Get transported to an area where 
you can't move (glitch).</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>"WALK ON 1999 AD MAP"- Using the code above, you can walk on the "Day 
of Lavos" map. Please note that when you are on this map you can't enter any 
buildings and you can't leave. Instructions are below:</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>1. 
Enter the code above (29BD-5F07).</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>2. Enter an invincibility 
code - Created by: LuKaS X - 7F67-5DD0</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>Instructions on how to 
use this code:</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>Turn GG on before battle and when you see the 
HP numbers messed up during battle turn the GG off.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>3. Enter 
the Walk-Thru Walls code -&nbsp; Created by: LuKaS X - EEB0-EFA4</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>4. Turn GG off and start a new game.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>5. Go to the 
fair and go to the part where you can steal the man's lunch.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>6. Turn the GG on and walk Northwest to the place where you fight 
Gato.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>7. Once you change areas it will show Crono fall of the 
cliffs on the side of Death Peak and land by a save point. Turn the GG 
off.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>8. Walk North/Northwest and go into the cave.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>9. Once in the cave, turn on the GG and kill the Lavos Spawn.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>10. Have the GG on, walk-thru walls to the right (past the chest with 
the Giga Arm in it) and walk up the stairs.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>11. Avoid the 
enemy that falls from the sky and continue up the stairs. You will see an 
entrance.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>12. Before entering, make sure that the GG is 
on.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>13. Once you go in the entrance, you will see your map 
Crono on a greenish colored screen. Walk to the</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>right.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>14. You are now walking on the 1999 AD map! 
Press select to look at the large map. Walk "around" the map to go on different 
continents.</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>1065-5466 "MAGUS ON MENU SCREEN"- Leave the GG off until you enter an 
area. Turn it on and then go to your menu screen. Crono will now have a Magus 
portrait and equipment. You can't keep the "Crono Magus" but you can unequip 
Magus' equipment and keep it.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>4CB5-5F6D "WALK THRU WALLS 
(LEFT AND RIGHT ONLY)"- This is a strange WTW code. You can "slide" your 
characters to the left and right in any area. Turn the GG off to stop them. Be 
careful where you stop and try not to walk off the screen.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>2AB4-77DD "TELEPORTER 2"- To use this code, enter any area and walk 
around in circles and such with any character. Eventually you will be 
transported to a random area, event, or ending. Sometimes you will be 
transported to a random area where you can't move (glitch). You should use this 
code with the WTW code (EEB0-EFA4, created by: LuKaSX@aol.com) in case you get 
stuck when you change screens.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>xx81-7769 "CHANGE STATS AND 
ITEMS"- Fill in xx with any 2 digits. Then go into battle. After the battle 
(game may freeze) go into the menu screen. Your characters will have different 
stats and items. This code not fully tested. May erase saves. Use at your own 
risk!</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>00BF-ED6C "STRANGE MENU SCREEN"- Does really strange 
things to the menu screen.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>7E66-7FAD "RELOAD SAVES"- Leave 
the GG off until you are on the map screen. Turn on the GG on and enter an area. 
Your saved games menu will pop up. Turn off the GG and select any save to 
play.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>1981-E46F "WHO'LL YOU REPLACE?" Instead of getting the 
saved game screen after the title screen, you will get the character exchange 
menu with many level 0 Crono's. Notice that there will be 6 character slots on 
the right (scroll down) instead of 4, for a total of 9 slots. Most likely the 
programmers were planning to have 2 more characters in the game but ended up not 
putting them in the final version.</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>EEDD-7F5D "START WITH HIGHER MAX. HP"- Will reset to normal with level 
up.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>63DD-745D "START WITH HIGHER MAX. MP"- Will reset to

<P><SMALL>AAE1-76EA "CRONO = ?"- Start a new game and Chrono will either be 
Frog, Magus, etc. He may even be Schala but when he fights, the game freezes. 
This code has a 50/50 chance of working.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>E1A5-7765 "ENEMIES 
CHANGE INTO DIFFERENT ENEMIES IN BATTLE"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>FEAB-67FA "PLACES 
ARE MIXED UP"-It works a little like the transporter codes but it doesn't 
freeze. Example: Crono walks into the Millennial Fair but instead of going to 
the fair he's in Guardia Castle in 600 A.D. When he exits, he will be back at 
the entrance of the fair.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>EDF3-7765 "HAVE NO CONTROL OF YOUR 
PARTY IN BATTLE"- Chrono, Marle, etc. may attack friends or foes.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>FD6E-7765 "CAN'T FIGHT IN BATTLE"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>DD3E-07FE "NO 
OVERWORLD MUSIC"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>AE65-EDFE "ENEMIES DO MASSIVE 
DAMAGE"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>AAE7-7765 "ENEMIES DIE LIKE BOSSES (THEY FLASH AND 
DISAPPEAR)"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>EE6D-7765 "ENEMIES WILL LOOK LIKE HEROES IN 
BATTLE"</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>A1EE-EDD9 "999 HP AND 99 MP AND GAIN ALL TECHS AFTER A BATTLE"- Will 
go to 999 hp and 99 mp and gain all techs after battle.(At first the game will 
look like it froze so after battle turn off the GG to go to the exp. and gold 
screen and it will look like you are going to level 99 but you are only getting 
full HP and MP and the techs).</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>A1E4-E7A9 "GET LOTS OF GOLD 
AFTER A BATTLE"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>3EBF-5767 "TRANSPORTER"- This code will 
transport your characters to different places than the other transport 
codes.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>E57B-F7A5 "KILL ANY ENEMY OR BOSS WITH ONE 
HIT"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>569A-6757 "GET DIFFERENT ITEMS AFTER A BATTLE"- This 
code is random.</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>85AB-67A4 "START A NEW GAME AS DALTON"- Note: Doesn't work on some 
games.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>EEC4-7DD5 "ENEMIES WON'T ATTACK UNLESS THEY ARE 
CLOSE"</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>xx72-E707 "TITLE SCREEN CHANGES"</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>Change what appears in place of the title screen.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>·DF- Shows partial credit list</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>·15- Glitchy 
screen, Lavos screams</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>EED0-EFE5 "MAGIC GRAPHICAL CHANGES"- Change the look of Magic. For 
example, Crono casts Lightning spell, but instead of a lightning bolt it shows a 
blue screen with a cool explosion (forgot the name of that spell). Change the 
first 2 slots for different effects. Code may freeze game.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>FF01-54DF "CHANGES CHARACTER'S SPRITE"- Change character looks. 
Examples: Crono's Mom looks like Melchoir, the cat is the King of Guardia, Gato 
is a Reptite, etc. Note: Game may black out if you enter enemy-only areas with 
GG on.</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>EE8E-7769 "EVERY ITEM CODE"- After battle, the game will freeze, but 
it's actually processing items. Wait a while, and the battle will end. Now take 
a look at your item list. You should have 98-100% of the items in the game. 
NOTE: the "dummied" items are totally useless. They were literally erased from 
the game and have no use. All you see of them is the icons.</SMALL> 
<BR><SMALL>EEE8-E7D9 "LEVEL UP EXPERIENCE"- After battle, all characters HP and 
MP will increase just as if you gained a level. This works also for people not 
in your current party.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>EE68-7DOC "ITEM SHOP/CHANGE EQUIP."- 
This code has two effects. The first is this: go into a shop (things should have 
different prices), exit it, go back in, and voila! Everything will cost only 
1GP, and you will be able to sell ANY item in your inventory; allowing you to 
rid yourself of old accessories, armor, etc. But you won't get anything for the 
things you sell. The second effect is this: simply go to the stat screen, and 
any character will be able to equip anything. Ex: equip Robo with a Rainbow, 
Crono with a Prism-Dress, etc. This doesn't mean you can equip, say, weapons in 
your armor slot, it means you can equip any weapon in your weapon slots, etc. 
NOTE: There are two bad sides to this code, the first is that you can't use 
items, and the second is that it causes graphic glitches while walking on the 
map. So, only use the effects of this code when needed.</SMALL> 
<P><SMALL>65EB-E4A9 "MAX OUT ABILITIES"- Maxes out all abilities such as power, 
magic, speed, etc. for every character.</SMALL> <BR><SMALL>56E0-5F69 "LEARN ALL 
TECHS" Learn all dual and triple techs.</SMALL> 
<P>.
