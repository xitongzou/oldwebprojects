A ROM is the video game itself. ROMs are legal if you own the game, or if you delete them after 24 hours. After that, they become illegal.</center></font><BR>

<br>
<blockquote>ZSNES is a Super Nintendo emulator programmed by zsKnight and _Demo_ in 100% assembler. This emulator is fast and can run commercial games with sound. It has only a few problems - the lack of a transparency feature means that the smog in the future covers the screen, but that can be easily fixed (see FAQ).</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>Snes9x is a portable, freeware Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) emulator. It basically allows you to play most games designed for the SNES and Super Famicom Nintendo game systems on your PC or Workstation; which includes some real gems that were only ever released in Japan. An awsome emulator - I haven't found any errors yet.</blockquote>
