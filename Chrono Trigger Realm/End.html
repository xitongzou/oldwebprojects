              attack and defense won't be strong enough. But in New Game+, you will be able to kill

            king hand the bell. Then they leave on Epoch while the king is stuck trying to hang the
            bell (similar to the &quot;Family Reunion&quot; ending ) If you crashed into Lavos with

            sees her father, who asks her to install the new bell he has made in her honor. She is
            carried off by the balloons while the credits roll. She lands near a tree like the one on
