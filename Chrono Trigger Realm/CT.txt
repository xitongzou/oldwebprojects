BATTLE CODES
------------

A1EE-EFD9  
All characters go to level 99 after one battle!  Save tabs until after you
do this to boost the the stats without a **.  <By: whrek@aol.com>

22EC-ED60
Get all techs/magic after one battle, including double and triple techs!  Go
into battle with different characters to get everyone's techs.
<By: lukas@westworld.com>

A1EE-EDD9
Get 999 HP, 99 MP and all techs after a battle.  Turn the GG off when the
game freezes, it will look like you are going to level 99 but you are only
getting full HP and MP and the techs.  <By: edgarggw@aol.com>

1438-7765
You are invincible and if a monster hits you they all die!
<By: tmslgs@aol.com>

9DA6-7765       Infinite MP for lead party member
9DAB-7765       Infinite MP for 2nd party member
9DA8-77D5       Infinite MP for 3rd party member
Works in battle mode only.  <By: greatwyrm@aol.com>

Change monsters you fight in battle!  <By: lukas@westworld.com>
xxDC-5FAF or xxDC-5F6F
Replace xx with different combinations to access different monsters when you
enter a battle.  The monsters you will get is very random, partly depends on
the original monster group you decide to enter battle with.  You can access
all monsters, including dummied out ones.  Keep in mind that the code
accesses parts of monsters as well.  For example, Lavos Spawn is only one
monster but has two attackable parts.  One downside to the code is that the
monster's graphic will be glitched if you are not in an area native to where
that monster is (color swap monsters are ok).  All special magic/tech
attacks the monster uses are fine, though.
Unusual monsters:
+-----------+------+---------------+------------------+--------------------+
|   Name    |  HP  | Attacks/Magic | Charm/Twin Charm | Exp./G/Tech P./Won |
+-----------+------+---------------+------------------+--------------------+
| Bull Frog |  100 | Regular/None  | Nothing/Nothing  | 127/200/4/Nothing  |
| Departed  | 1650 | Regular/None  | HyperEther/Same  | 555/500/8/Lapis    |
| Frog King |    1 | Regular/None  | Nothing/Nothing  | 10/100/1/Nothing   |
| Johnny    |  408 | Regular/None  | Nothing/Nothing  | 246/150/8/Nothing  |
| Octobino  |    1 | Regular/None  | Nothing/Nothing  | 146/250/4/Nothing  |
| Octorider |  100 | None/None     | Nothing/Nothing  | 30/45/2/Nothing    |
| Ogre      |    1 | None/None     | Nothing/Nothing  | 348/650/8/Nothing  |
| Omicrone  |    1 | None/None     | Nothing/Nothing  | 455/600/8/Nothing  |
+-----------+------+---------------+------------------+--------------------+

3365-5D00
Win a battle after killing only 1 enemy.  For some enemies there is no need
to fight.  You will only get Exp./tech points/G for the monster you killed,
however.  <By: scmche19@skypoint.com>

EE8E-7769
Get nearly every item in the game after winning a battle.  After battle,
the game will freeze, but it's actually processing items.  Wait a while,
and the battle will end.  Now take a look at your item list.  You should
have 98-100% of the items in the game.  Note: the "dummied" items are
totally useless.  They were literally erased from the game and have no use.
All you see of them is the icons.  <By: balefire99@aol.com>

EEE8-E7D9
Gain more HP and MP after winning a battle.  After battle, all characters HP
and MP will increase just as if you gained a level. This works also for
people not in your current party.  <By: balefire99@aol.com>

FF65-5F0F
Enemies reappear after a battle.  <By: scmche19@skypoint.com>

B325-7765
Only techs damage enemies.  <By: gamewiz4u@aol.com>

33DD-7D6D
No menus in battle mode.  <By: lukas@westworld.com>

33DD-74DD
Different, random sound effects in battle.  <By: lukas@westworld.com>

24A0-5700
Invincible to almost all types of monster attacks/magic.  Stronger enemies
may kill some of the party members but not the lead character.
<By: scmche19@skypoint.com>

1A6F-E400    
Automatically win a battle.  Go into a fight and as soon as one of your
characters goes to attack the enemies will disappear and the game will
continue normally.  <By: lukas@westworld.com>

EED0-EFE5
Techs you use will have the graphic of another tech.  Change first 2 slots
of the code for different effects.  <By: lukas@westworld.com>
                       
65EB-E4A9
Max. out all abilities such as power, magic, speed, etc. for every
character.  <By: wcook10721@aol.com>

F5A0-54A1
All attacks in battle (physical or magic) do 9999 damage.  Use this code
with the invincibility code 24A0-5700 to max. party member's attributes
when they gain levels.  The attributes will go down again if levels are
gained while the codes are not active.  <By: scmche19@skypoint.com>

5E2A-5F01
Random effects after winning a battle.  You may get a weapon from an enemy
that gives an item, have your HP raised to 999 at level 1 or learn most or
all techs after a battle.  The effect depends on the time period and
location.  When using this code, let the game freeze before choosing an
attack command, then turn the GG off and back on.  Before the game freezes
again kill all of the enemies.  <By: scmche19@skypoint.com>

7F67-5DD0
Play dead to win battles instantly.  When you go into combat your party
members will fall down like they died.  Turn the GG off, the monsters
disappear, and the game continues normally.  Works on bosses as well.

Enemies can't use techs/magic/special attacks at all.  Try this on Spekkio!
He's hilariously easy.  A few notes: You'll see Spekkio's physical attacks.
Also, when fighting the 2nd Lavos, you *must* turn off the GG after you
destroy both arms for it to use Obstacle and lower its defense.  Also, you
must turn it off again at the Lavos Core for the Active Life bit to turn off
defense.  <By: glescoe@aol.com>

9DB9-7765

Some party members may jump to different places on the screen during the
battle so use this code with a walk thru walls code in case your characters
get stuck in a wall.  <By: lukas@westworld.com>

3BC4-7765
Most moving monsters will try to run away in battle.  Will not work on
enemies that don't move or bosses.  Some monsters may fight back if you
attack while they are trying to run.  A few enemies may glitch the game,
like the Winged Apes.  Not perfect, but a helpful code.

Game may freeze sometimes.  <By: gamewiz4u@aol.com>

65B2-7760
Does strange things after a battle.  You may get lots of exp. and just a
few gold and tech points or you may get lots of gold and just a little exp.
and tech points.  If you fight an enemy that usually gives an item after a
battle you might get lots of a different item.  During the battle enemies
might keep attacking over and over again so turn the GG off and back on when
they stop.  Try to keep the GG on most of the battle.  This code may not do
anything when fighting certain enemy groups.  Try fighting large groups of
enemies.  <By: lukas@westworld.com>

336A-ED09
Alter stats and other things after a battle.  After you start a new game, go
to Guardia Forest with Crono only.  Then go to the bird with the bell and
fight the 2 beetles.  Do not touch the other creatures.  When in battle, the
game will freeze.  Turn the GG off and back on.  After killing one beetle,
run away from battle.  When the screen messes up turn the GG off again, then
turn it back on when you hear the running away sound.  The normal screen
will also be messed up so go to the menu screen and exit.  If the trick
worked, Crono's stats will have changed and there will be 6 cats at Crono's
house.  If you go upstairs at his house Crono's mom will wake him up again.

Following codes may cause an eternal battle (EB).  Battles don't end; hidden
enemies will continue attacking you.  To get out of the battle, you must

ACTION SCREEN CODES
-------------------

Magus vs. Magus!  <By: aerostar13@aol.com>
Requirements: CT Walk Thru Walls Code (EEBO-EFA4)
1. Begin a new game or New Game +.
2. Play normally until you get chased into the future and land in the Bangor
   Dome.
3. Go thru Lab 16.
4. Turn the Walk Thru Walls code on.
5. Go thru Sewer Access to the Keeper's Dome.
6. Walk thru the sealed doors and get the Epoch.
7. Travel to 12000 B.C. and play the rest of the game normally... until you
   get Magus.
8. When you get Magus and the Black Omen appears, go to the Denandoro Mts.
   and fight Masamune (sometimes he's already dead).
9. Go to Melchior's and fix the Masamune (don't try and walk out the door
   while they're working or the game will freeze).
10. Go back to 600 A.D.  Magus' Castle will be there!
11. Go in with Magus in your party and see Magus vs. Magus!

C41A-ED04
Save your game anywhere, including the Programmer's ending and at Lavos
(when Lavos changes attack mode).  Walk into any area with a save point.
Touch it and it will hear a ching, do it again and it won't.  Now check
your status screen and you can save anywhere.  Code still works without
the GG as long as you don't enter an area with a save point.
<By: lukas@westworld.com>

0B60-7FA4
Near perfect walk thru walls code!  Walk anywhere on any screen.  However,
you will not be able to change areas with the GG on.
<By: lukas@westworld.com>

C356-EDA7
Wave background (like when fighting Lavos Core) when you enter an area.
Game may glitch if you keep switching areas.  <By: lukas@westworld.com>

EEB0-EFA4
Revised walk thru walls code.  Doesn't work in all areas and can't move on
all parts of the screen.  However you can change areas (walk thru sealed
doors, etc.).  Use this code to skip a large portion of the game by walking
through the sealed doors to get Epoch on the first visit to the future.
Also, there is a "secret path" in the room where Janus and Schala talk,
right above the book cases.  It will take you to one of the ending scenes,
then dump you on the elevator shaft in the Ocean Palace with all characters
in your party, including Magus.  Credit goes out to the person on the
Gamewiz board who found this.  <By: lukas@westworld.com>

Conversations repeat, can also listen to conversations from other parts of
the game.  Talk to a person (or look at a sign, etc.), go to the menu
screen, then exit.  The text should repeat.  Now, if you go to different
areas, go to the menu screen and quit, you may get speech from another part
of the game.  <By: lukas@westworld.com>

29BD-5F07
Teleport code.  Depending on what area you enter (or if you change areas)
many things may happen like:
1. Get an ending.
2. Get transported to an event in the game.
3. Get transported to another area in the same era.
4. Get transported to another era.
5. Get transported to a map.
6. Get transported to an area where you can't move (glitch).
See the "Walk on 1999 A.D. map" for an interesting use for the code ;)

transport codes (when you switch areas).  Will also change where you are on

Leave the GG off until you enter a building in Truce 1000 A.D.  Turn the GG
on and leave the building.  When you see the map turn the GG off again.  Now
you will be watching the "Killed by Lavos" ending.
<By: lukas@westworld.com>

EEB4-546B
This code is very weird.  It is a modified version of the code for the bad
ending every time you go into a Truce Village house.  Turn on the GG when it
starts saying "Crono..."  Then go down and talk to Crono's Mom. She will
give you the chance to name Lucca but you will only get a black screen
instead of the name screen.  Press Start to go on from this point.  Then go
straight upstairs and go back down.  You have about a 50/50 chance of seeing
Crono's Mom sitting in her chair.  If she is, then when you come up to her
she will say something like "Crono, I heard you were going to be executed."
This means you skipped ahead into the game.  The save menu name is now
Forward to the Past.  You only have Crono, but the events are the same as if
you had gone through the game to that point except the men are still
guarding Lucca's machine.  It certainly is weird and there are many
glitches, but it might be modified. Also if you keep it on, you may see the
bad ending in a building in Truce.  <By: strato508@aol.com>

4CB5-5F6D
Strange walk thru walls code. You can "slide" your characters to the left
and right in any area.  Turn the GG off to stop them.  Be careful where you
stop and try not to walk off the screen.  <By: lukas@westworld.com>

6CB5-5DD7
Your party will run very fast but in an up direction only.  If you get stuck
against a wall turn off the GG and do a regular sprint to free yourself.
<By: lukas@westworld.com>

2AB4-77DD
Teleport code.  To use this code, enter any area and walk around in circles
and such with any character.  Eventually you will be transported to a random
area, event, or ending.  Sometimes you will be transported to a random area
where you can't move (glitch).  You should use this code with a walk thru
walls in case you get stuck when you change screens.
<By: lukas@westworld.com>



STATUS SCREEN AND TITLE SCREEN CODES
------------------------------------

3F65-EF06
Get some items just by going into the items screen (try equipping characters
first).  <By: scmche19@skypoint.com> 

EE68-7DOC   
This code has two effects.  The first is this: go into a shop (things should
have different prices), exit it, go back in, and voila!  Everything will
cost only 1GP, and you will be able to sell ANY item in your inventory;
allowing you to rid yourself of old accessories, armor, etc.  But you
won't get anything for the things you sell.  The second effect is this:
simply go to the stat screen, and any character will be able to equip
anything.  Ex: equip Robo with a Rainbow, Crono with a Prism Dress, etc.
This doesn't mean you can equip, say, weapons in your armor slot, it means
you can equip any weapon in your weapon slots, etc.  Note: There are two bad
sides to this code, the first is that you can't use items, and the second
is that it causes graphic glitches while walking on the map. So, only use
the effects of this code when needed.  <By: balefire99@aol.com>

1065-5466      
Get Magus on your menu screen.  Leave the GG off until you enter an area.
Turn it on and then go to your menu screen.  Crono will now have a Magus
portrait and equipment. You can't keep the "Crono Magus" but you can
unequip Magus' equipment and keep it.  <By: lukas@westworld.com>

after the title screen you will get the one from the menu.  Choose a slot
and save.  Then reset the game with the GG turned off.  Use New Game + on
that save and Crono will begin with 0 of almost everything.  No known useful
effect for this code yet.  <By: lukas@westworld.com>



MAP SCREEN CODES
----------------

Walk on the 1999 A.D. Day of Lavos map! <By: lukas@westworld.com>
1. Enter the following codes:
   29BD-5F07 (teleport)
   7F67-5DD0 (invincibility - turn GG off when party falls "dead" in battle) 
   EEB0-EFA4 (walk thru walls)
2. Turn GG off and start a new game.
3. Go to the fair, turn the GG on right before you enter the area where
   Gato is.
4. Once you change areas it will show Crono fall of the cliffs on the side
   of Death Peak and land by a save point.  Turn the GG off.
5. Walk North/Northwest and go into the cave.
6. Once in the cave, turn on the GG and "kill" the Lavos Spawn.
7. Have the GG on, walk-thru walls to the right (past the chest with the
   Giga Arm in it), walk up both sets of stairs, and into the cave entrance.
8. You will see your map Crono on a greenish colored screen.  Walk to the
   right.  Viola!  You are now walking on the 1999 A.D. map!  Even pops up
   in the lower left corner :)  Press select to look at the large map.  Walk
   "around" the map to go on different continents.  You can save your game
   here too, but not a good idea as you are unable to leave.
