<blockquote>
<h4 align="center">Crono</h4>
<li><a href="images/crono.jpg">The Ideal Crono</a>
<li>Name: Crono
<li>Occupation: Unemployed
<li>Weapon of Choice: Swords
<li>Time Period: Present
<li>Magic: Lightning
<li>Description: Crono is the hero of Chrono Trigger.  He is a young man in the Kingdom of Guardia, who, in going to the Millenial Fair and looking at Lucca's new invention, accidentally time travels to the past, future, and the end of time. He is a good fighter, and at the max, his attack is only topped by one person, Ayla, by one point.  He also has Luminaire, which is a great spell that attacks all enemies for about 2000.<br><p>
<h4 align="center">Marle</h4>
<li><a href="images/marle.jpg">The Ideal Marle</a>
<li>Name: Marle
<li>Occupation: Princess
<li>Weapon: Bows
<li>Time Period: Present
<li>Magic: Ice
<li>Description: Marle hates being a princess.  When you first meet her, she has run away from the palace, and is traveling incognito (sound familar?).  She is also Crono's love interest, and Ayla's descendent.  She is the healer of your party.  The only attack spells she has are Ice and Ice2.  She does get Haste, and some pretty good healing spells, but none of them ever heal more than one person, which is a major drawback.  Not the best character.
<h4 align="center">Lucca</h4>
<li><a href="images/lucca.jpg">The Ideal Lucca</a>
<li>Name: Lucca
<li>Occupation: Inventor
<li>Weapon: Guns
<li>Time Period: Present
<li>Magic: Fire
<li>Description: Lucca is a great inventor who can be a bit of a braggart.  She feels very guilty about her mother, Lara, who was crippled b an invention of her father.  She was there when it happened, but she didn't know enough to stop the machine, so, after the accident, she resolved to learn more about machines to prevent another tragedy from happening.  She is a horrible fighter, but a good magic user.  Her best spell, Flare, has about the same level of effectiveness as Crono's Luminaire.
<h4 align="center">Frog</h4>
<li><a href="images/frog.jpg">The Ideal Frog</a>
<li>Name: Frog
<li>Occupation: Queen's protector, Knight
<li>Weapon: Broadsword, Masamune
<li>Time Period: Past
<li>Magic: Water
<li>Description:  Frog was changed into a frog by Magus.  He is very honorable, and very loyal to the King and Queen. Anyway, his original name was Glenn, and he was the best friend of Cyrus, leader of the Knights of the Square table. (Catch any Arthurian references there?  :) He's a great fighter, since he wields the mythical Masamune, but his spells downright leave much to be desired.
<h4 align="center">Robo</h4>
<li><a href="images/robo.jpg">The Ideal Robo</a>
<li>Name: Robo
<li>Occupation: Robot
<li>Weapon:  Different arms
<li>Time Period: Future
<li>Magic: None, but his electronic weapons approximate Shadow Magic
<li>Description:  When you first find Robo, he is a wreck.  Lucca decides to repair him, and he gives his loyalty to Lucca and the rest.  In an optional adventure near the end of the game, you find out more about his past.  He is a good fighter, not great, but good, and his Shock spell is about the same effectiveness as Luminaire.  He also has a couple really handy healing spells, one of which heals your entire party.
<h4 align="center">Ayla</h4>
<li><a href="images/ayla.jpg">The Ideal Ayla</a>
<li>Name: Ayla
<li>Occupation: Chief
<li>Weapon: Fist
<li>Time Period: Prehistoric
<li>Magic: She uses special attacks instead.
<li>Description:  Ayla is the chief of her tribe, which means she is really strong.  She is also in love with Kino, her second in command, and a fairly minor character overall.
<h4 align="center">Magus</h4>
<li><a href="images/magus.jpg">The Ideal Magus</a>
<li>Name: Magus
<li>Occupation: "Evil" Sorcerer
<li>Weapon:  Scythe
<li>Time Period: He was born in the Dark Ages, but he was accidentally sent to the Middle Ages as a child.
<li>Magic: Shadow
<li>Description:  Magus starts out seeming as if he's going to be the boss of the game, or at least a major boss.  However, while he is a major boss, he eventually becomes a reluctant ally.  He was born in the Dark Ages, the son of Queen Zeal.  His name there was Janus.  Janus seemed to have no magic, and was ostracized for that.  His only friends were his sister Schala, and his cat, Alfador.  He is the strongest magic-user (except maybe for Lucca) in the game.  This was only discovered after the accident which sent him to the Middle Ages though.  He quite often seems cold-hearted, but he cares deeply for his sister and Alfador.
<h4 align="center">Schala</h4>
<li><a href="images/schala.jpg">The Ideal Schala</a>
<li>Name: Schala
<li>Occupation: Sorceress/Princess
<li>Weapon:  Magic (staffs).  
<li>Time Period: Dark Ages
<li>Magic: Rainbow.
<li>Description: The sister of Magus.  She is the only person that Magus cares deeply about (besides alfrador), yet she is only in the game for a short time period, and is never in your party (though I heard you could get her!).  She rescues your party at one point, even though she is risking her life to do so.  She also is the only 'Enlightened One' (magic-user) who does not think of the 'Earthbound Ones' (non-magic-users) as inferior beings.  She is also considered the most powerful sorceress in the Kingdom of Zeal.  The last time you see her, she teleports you out of the sinking (sort of) Ocean Palace, she stays behind.<BR>
