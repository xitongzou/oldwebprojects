          Crono's mom. Go to the mayor's house and get the money from the upstairs. Talk to the
          people if you want to learn something. Go to the south continent to the Porre Shop. Buy
          whatever defense items you can afford. Don't buy the sword. Now go to the Fair. Go
          directly up. Bump into the girl. This is Marle. Talk to her, grab her pendant and give it
          to her. She will ask to join you. Say yes. Now go to Guardia Forest and fight the Hetakes
          (the mushroom-looking things) and build your level to at least five. Go to the lower lower
          right part of the forest. You'll see a sparkling object. Press &quot;A&quot; above it and
          receive a power tab.Go back to the fair and earn silver points. However you like. You can
          fight Gato, bet on the races, the hammer challenge or the soda guzzling contest. Trade the
          points for gold and when you have enough, buy a Lode sword from Melchior. The Sword will
          help a lot. Four things to do at the fair. Don't ask Marle to sell her pendant. Have the
          cat follow you to the little girl. Don't take the pink package near the old man. And when
          you go to see Lucca's invention, Marle will want candy. Wait until she buys something.
          Don't move until then. This will help you prove your innocence later on. You will want to
          get the clone by paying 40 silver points at the Tent of Horrors if you want Crono back
          later. Get the cat for 80 points if you want kittens. Keep paying 80 points for cat food.
          When you get enough, your cats will have kittens. When you are ready, go to north to
          Lucca's invention. When Taban finishes talking, talk to Lucca and use the telepod, then
          talk to Marle. She will disappear. Get her pendant and go into the past. Don't go into the
          right telepod or you will die in the hands of Lavos (only in game+).</p>

          <p align="left">You'll find yourself in a canyon. Go to the upper left and you will be
          attacked by imps. They are easy and can't do more than 10 points of damage each. Kill them
          and go though the upper left corner. Continue moving, fight whatever enemies and exit. Go
          to each building and talk to everyone. Now go through Guardia forest. Tip: when you see
          bushes rustling press &quot;A&quot; in front of them and be attacked or get a shelter. At
          the lower right part of the forest you will see two sparkling objects. Don't go for the
          lower one. It will cause two roly riders to appear. Anyway, go north and go to Guardia
          Castle. You will be stopped by soldiers but Queen Leene will stop them from doing
          anything. Go talk to everyone. Don't open any chests in the castle. You can get better
          stuff in 1000 AD. Now head for the Queen's room which is to the right of the thrones. Talk
          to the Queen to discover she is really Marle. She will disappear. Head downstairs and meet
          Lucca. She will tell you that Marle is actually Princess Nadia in 1000 AD but history has
          changed. Now you must rescue the real Queen to get Marle back. Go to the Truce store and
          upgrade whatever you need to. You will need 2 shelters, about 20 tonics and maybe a revive
          or two. Build up Lucca until she learns flame toss. Go to the cathedral and talk to the
          nun near the organ. You will then see a sparkling object. Pick it up and you'll be
          attacked by the nuns, who are really naga-ettes. Use the fire whirl combo to kill them
          easily. When you do, a hidden naga-ette will appear and strike Lucca. Frog will come to
          the rescue. Join him and leave. Go to Guardia forest and build up Frog until he gets slurp
          cut and learn the X-Strike combo. Play the organ to open up a secret door. Go to the right
          and go north. open the door and open the chests. Equip whatever upgrades you get. Go to
          the drawer with the egg on it and press &quot;A&quot;. You will get the secret naga-ette
          bromide. You will be attacked. The bromide will not appear on your inventory list, but
          don't worry, you have it. Above is a door surrounded by spikes. Use the skull on the wall
          to lower them. Go inside. The bucket on the left contains a tab. Take it. Go to the right
          into the monsters' dining hall. The upper room contains three monsters. Try to leave and
          you will be attacked. Go to the right to find a door. Don't talk to the monsters. Go up
          and open the chests. Leave and go to the center door. There is a save spot. Save and use a
          shelter if you need to. Go to the right and fall down the stairs. Go up and push the
          skull. Go around and back to the save spot. Go to the door above and you'll be attacked.
          Destroy them and play the organ. Now go around and you'll find a new door. Run through the
          enemies and to the save spot. If you need to fight, fight. Use a shelter and save. Now go
          through the door to fight <a href="boss.htm#Yakra">Yakra</a>. Then, open the chests to
          find an item and the real chancellor. At Guardia Castle, Frog will leave. Go to the
          queen's room to get back Marle. Go to the canyon where the gate was. Lucca will open it
          with the gate key and you will return to your own time. </p>

          executed. When in the prison cell, drink from the cup and take the pack. Don't bother the

          guard in the prison. Wait for execution. Lucca will burst in and knock the guards out.
          Outside, release the man. He is Fritz, the Truce merchant's son. He will give you stuff

          <p align="left">You find yourself in the Bangor dome with a sealed door and the gate.
          Don't bother going through the gate. The woods are blocked of. Go south to the Trann dome
          and buy whatever you need and talk to the people. Use the enertron and go north to lab 16.
          Caution: if you stay outside too long, you'll take damage. Pass through the lab and open
          any chests you find. They will contain weapons and useful items. Don't touch the rats or
          they'll steal tonics from you. The shadows can only be hurt by magic, so use fire whirl to
          kill all of them at once. Through the lab, you'll see Arris dome. They are waiting for
          food to be delivered from the basement. Use the enertron and save. Go to the basement and
          look at the rat. Keep moving and fight the <a href="boss.htm#Guardian and Bits">Guardian
          and the two Bits</a>. Then, when you go into the food compartment, you'll find a dead man
          clutching some seeds. Take it and look at him to read about the rat. Chase the rat and
          press &quot;A&quot; to catch him. He'll tell the secret code of the info center. Go to the
          right console and press &quot;L&quot; and &quot;R&quot; at the same time press
          &quot;A&quot;. Go through the maze and find the central computer. You see the time gate is
          in the Proto Dome. Marle presses another button and you watch in horror as Lavos comes
          from the Core and destroys the world. There you decide to change time to prevent the Day
          of Lavos. You give the seeds to Doan for the Jet Bike key. Go to Lab 32 to the east. You
          can go through Sewer Access to meet Belthasar in the Keeper's Dome, but you won't get
          anything from him. In Lab 32, you meet Johnny, a human-like robot. Race him. Doesn't
          matter if he's winning for the beginning but when the very top meter reads about 20, you
          must turbo boost in front of him to win. When you win, go back into the race course on
          foot and get the Race Log. With it, you'll earn items if you have high scores. Here's a
          way to get high scores: when the robot asks which race mode you wish, choose &quot;without
          turbo boost - L &amp; R change view&quot;. Then, when you start the race, press R until
          you see them from the back. Now, you must race and hit Johnny from the front again and
          again. We have been able to go all the way &quot;on his head&quot;, getting 2371 pts. You
          can get 1 PowerTab (once) if you have more than 1500 pts, and (Mid-)Ethers if you have
          more than 1300, 2000 or 2300 pts. Go east then south into the Proto Dome. There is an
          enertron inside if you need it, but you must fight two groups of debuggers. First a group
          of three and then a group of four. Keep going up to find a robot. This is Robo. Lucca will
          repair him and he will join you. Since the door to the gate is unpowered, a party of three
          must go to the factory to power the door and one person must stay to keep it open. We
          suggest taking Marle. The Aura Whirl combo will come in handy. Go to factory and have Robo
          deactivate the laser. An acid will fall and you'll have to fight him. Be careful. It has
          about 10 h.p. but it has an unbelievable high defense. Go to the right elevator. enter the
          conveyor belt and touch a robot. The crane will pick you up and put you on another
          conveyor belt. You must fight through three rooms of debuggers and Proto 3s. When you
          finish, the conveyor belt drops you off. Go down and fight the Bugs. Go to the computer
          room on the right to learn the crane control codes. Go to the left to the crane controls.
          Press &quot;B&quot;,&quot;B&quot; to remove one barrel and &quot;X&quot;,&quot;A&quot; to
          remove the other barrel. Go to the room you couldn't access before because of the barrels
          and use the computer. It will tell you the power activation code. Go back up and go to the
          left elevator to the lab. You'll fight alkalines and acids. Destroy the monster that has
          only one in its number since they can do a powerful combo attack. Use the computer to open
          the hatch. Continue until you reach another computer access it, fight the monsters and go
          down. Activate the power by pressing
          &quot;X&quot;,&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;Y&quot; at the last computer. Pull the
          switch to power up. Then run out since the security will go haywire. Run to the exit. You
          will be stopped by the <a href="boss.htm#R Series">R-series</a>. They will scrap him for
          being a defect and come after you. Then, you will take Robo to Lucca to be fixed. Go
          through the the door and into the Gate, which will malfunction and send you elsewhere.</p>
