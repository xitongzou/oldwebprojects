<b>What if Piccolo had remembered to use his new abilities from King Kai, namely the Kaio-Ken, when he fought Frieza? By:<a href="mailto:dannytheman1110@hotmail.com">Danny Goldbeck</a></b>
<br>
First off he would be able to beat up on Frieza really hard and not show mercy to him do to his anger about Frieza killing mostly everyone on his home planet. Piccolo would be more than a match for Frieza at even X2 although he'd probably go to X3 to be sure. At this point he could probably beat him so hard that Frieza couldn't even get the chance to transform again. Not showing mercy like Goku, Piccolo would kill off Frieza. After the battle, Piccolo would be on an ego-high. He would insist that Dende fuse w/ him. Dende, having no real use w/ Frieza dead would reluntantly agree. After the merging Piccolo's power level would rise way up. He'd probably be somewhere inbetween his level at the end of the Namek saga and the Android saga. Anyway they would all head back to the ship and just cruise back to Earth in Frieza's ship. They all might get to Yadfat and get the Instant Transmission and lots of training.
After a while they would transport back to Earth. On Earth they would get back their friends and would restore the Namekians to Namek via the D-balls. At that time Vegeta would probably very close to or even at Super-Sayjin levels. (Along w/ Goku) Gohan would still have quite a bit of work to do but would be a lot more powerful than in the regular series, as would Krillin. The added training would probably put Piccolo at the same level as in the Android saga now. Trunks would come and tell them about the androids and would kill off Kold w/ some help since Kold would be pretty PO'd at all of the Z warriors for killing his son. They would train and even w/o Goku (heart virus) be able to beat 19 easily. 20 would awaken the other ones. Vegeta would be a much better match for 18 and if the Z fighters decided to interfere Piccolo could hold off 17 until the others helped Vegeta w/ 18. Then w/ all of them attacking at once the would put 17 out of commision. During the fight 16 would probably

<b>What if Goku and Gohan went into the Hyperbolic chamber before Vegeta and 
Trunks? 
By:<a href="mailto:DashSpree6@aol.com ">DashSpree6@aol.com  
</a></b>
<br>
Goku and Gohan would come out and immeadiatly go to destroy Cell before he 
absorbed android 18. Goku would want to fight first and they'd lower down to 
the island. Cell would think that he would destroy Goku and Gohan easily, 
then become perfect.  Goku would easily take the upper hand.  Cell would 
realize he stood no chance and try to convince Goku to let him absorb android 
18 like he did with Vegeta.  Goku would not make the same mistake and would 
offer Cell a chance to live which Cell would refuse.  Goku would then destroy 
Cell very easily.  The androids would probably fly away and live peacefully.   
Goku would ask Krillin where tien and Piccilo were.  Krillin would explain 
what happened because Goku wasn't there to revive them with sensu beans.   
Gohan and Goku would be very angry and would immeadiatly try to summon the 
dragon at Kami's place.  They would both be revived.  Vegeta would then come 
out and see Cell was destroyed.  Vegeta would challenge Goku even though 
there was really no chance he could win.  Trunks would try to stop him but 
Vegeta would refuse.  Goku would say no and Vegeta would threaten to destroy 
Kami's place and the things on it.  Goku, a little tired out from the cell 
battle would start beating the tar out of Vegeta and would tell him to give 
and Vegeta would refuse.  To save his pride and hurt Goku mentally, Vegeta 
would go after Gohan who would start whipping Vegeta.  Trunks would try to 
put a stop to this but Vegeta would tell him to get away.  Trunks would say 
you are going to die and Vegeta would answer that he didn't care.  Goku and 
Gohan would lay pity and tell Vegeta to go train, which he would.  Trunks 
would then go back to the future and destroy Cell and the androids like what 
really happened.  As a result of this, 18 would still be alie and would not 
marry Krillin, Gohan would not go to SSJ2, and Goku would still be alive.

<b>What if Krillin killed Vegeta with Yagorobe's sword By:<a href="mailto:dcsimpson1@aol.com">Dcsimpson1</a></b>
<br>
Gohan and Krillin would have gone on planet namek and would probaly get 
killed by Dodoria. When Goku came he would of found Bulma and heard the news. 
He would go SSJ, find Frieza form 1 (not immortal) and would of killed frieza 
and the rest of the people. He would get  back home with Bulma and would of 
revived Gohan, and Krillin. He would of got inturupted by Garlic Jr. and GJ 
would of went to the dead zone. Then he would revived piccillo. He would of   
Killed King Kold (no frieza bot). Would of revived tien, choutzu, and then 
Yamcha. Then Earth would be destroyed by 17 and 18 (because of Vegeta dead no 
trunks). 
<BR><BR>

<b>-NEW-What if Gohan kept training instead of studying? By:<a href="mailto:DYRAV@aol.com ">DYRAV@aol.com</a></b>
<br>
Since he was already stronger than vegita in the series gohan would have been 
at a lot hire level than him.  When babidi came he would have been destroyed 
along w/his folowers.  But since gohan was a lot stronger he would have given 
a power boost to Buu.  He would come and beat gohan up until goku transported 
away. 
<BR><BR>
    At this point gotenks and trunks would be alot stronger too since gohan 
trained them.  They would be at the same power level uss trunks was when he 
fought cell w/goten beign a little bit stronger.  They would go in and come 
out ss2 saiyans. 
<BR><BR>
    While they went in for their second day goku and gohan would hold off buu 
so the younger saiyans trained.  They would then make a deal w/him that if 
they didn't come out in a day he could destroy earth.  When the little 
saiyans came out they were both at gohans maxpowerlevel.  Both of them would 
go after buu and start winning.  Then buu would be forced too escape.  He 
would go down to earth w/ piccolo and goten following closely.  He would 
trick piccolo and absorb him then would move on.  He would find master 
roshi's island and absorb yamcha krilin and 18.  Then he would find the next 
energy sorce and absorb trin and choutzu.  Since he absorbed the most part of 
the z-team he would be at the super buu level but at a much hire powerlevel.   
<BR><BR>
    Back at kami's lookout gohan and goku would feel the enormous power and 
have to teach teach the little saiyans the fusion after that they would go 
into the hyperbolic time chaimber and train for their second day.  When buu 
came up he and gotenks would have good match with gotenks slowly losing 
power.  He would stall until he ran out of fusion time and then go down to 
regular saiyan level so when he got absorbed he wouldn't give buu too much 
power.  Now Buu would be a lot more powerful.   
<BR><BR>
    When goku and gohan came out they would they would both be at ss3 level 
w/gohan having the hire level.  They would both start beating on super buu 
until they could get enough time to perform the fusion dance turning into 
gohanku.  They would put up a great fight and be winning.  until the fusion 
wore off then they would separate.  While Gohan stalled goku woul go in and 
save goten and trunks.  While goku was in there vegita would arrive showing 
off his ss3 power.  They would fight but be on losing end of the fight.  The 
north kaioshin would send them the potara earings.  When they put them on 
they would turn to Gogita.  Super buu would get really mad and turn to kid 
buu.  Goku would come out and see them.  Trunks and Goten would again fuse 
and help Gogeta. Goku would join the fight.  Goku and gotenks would stall 
until gogita could form the ultmate attack, the final flashing spirit bomb.   
They would destoy kid buu.   
<BR><BR>
    While they were in their fused forms Gogita(gohan and vegita not goku) 
would go in the time chaimberand train for two days coming out ss4!)  They 
would go in again and come out at the same level gogita was at when he faced 
the last shenron.  When they got out they wished to be seperated.  They would 
both be way more powerful than goku and be at even levels.  There would be gt 
and they would just let goku have all the adventure.  When the shenrons came 
gogita would watch goku fight and give him some help when he needed it.  In 
the end everything would be peaceful, a wish would be made and all the 
saiyans that were living would be granted youth and immortality and be the 
guardians of earth.

<b>-NEW-What if Goten was born the year after Gohan was? By:<a href="mailto:DYRAV@aol.com ">DYRAV@aol.com</a></b>
<br>
Well first off in the saiyan saga sinse both of them were there piccolo 
would make both of them go into the forest toghether so they could have 
sparring partners.  when they got out of the forest they would both be at the 
same power level as piccolo  3,000.  When the year had passed all three of 
them would be at a powerlevel of 6,000 and know the special beam cannon, the 
masenko and, the kamehameya.  The rest of the Z-fighters would have been at 
their normal power levels.   
<BR><BR>
    Gohan would have kicked nappas but who was only at level 4,500 with a 
beam cannon and killed him. The Z-fighters took on the saibamen and everyone 
survived but yamcha. When they faced off against vegita Gohan would be at 
level 8,000 for beating Nappa.  They would all have to go against vegita and 
would all get beat up and piccolo would get killed off.  Gohan and goten 
would get scared but still fight.  Now the saiyans would have too hold off 
vegita until goku came.  Unfortunetly the whole Z-team would die except for 
Krillin.   
<BR><BR>
    When he came he would give them senzus goten would be at level 10,000 and 
gohan would be at 12,000.  Goku would power up too his max level 8,000 then 
go kaioken times4 plus a kamehameha and be powered up to level 37,000 going 
toe to toe with vegita at his max.   
<BR><BR>
    Then Vegita would go into his oozaru form(monkey) and kick Gokus but 
until all of his bones were crushed.  Fortunetly before he could kill goku 
krillin would form a distructo disk and chop off vegita's tail.  He would 
still be stronger than them but gohan and goten would still have a good 
fight.  They would tell Krillin to form a distraction.  Gohan and Goten would 
form an attack that they made up the ultimate beam cannon.  It's when the 
first person forms a beam cannon then the second one would make another 
swirling around that one.  When Vegita noticed the power he would turn around 
but it would be too late.  It would hit him, hard he would be close too death 
but Goku would tell them too let him go.   
<BR><BR>
    Since they won they would go up to level 18,000 and since Goku got hurt 
he would go up to level 17,000.   Gohan would be the boss and tell goku too 
teach them 
the kaio ken.  With all the training they would all go up to level 24,000 
and Krillin would be up to 20,000.  On namek Vegita would finish healing and 
be at level 22,000.  He would beat Kui and go up to 24,000.  He then beats 
Dodoria and goes up to level 26,000.   
<BR><BR>
    When the Earth saiyans and Krillin go to namek they train with Goku under 
100times gravity.  Back on namek Vegita just got beat up by Zarbon.  He goes 
back into the healing tube and comes out at a power level of 35,000.  He then 
beats up and kills Zarbon and goes up to level 39,000.  Frieza calls for the 
ginyu force and vegita kills Gerudo but his level doesn't rise.  He then gets 
the crap beat out of him by Rikum.  When the Z-team arrives they are all at 
the level 180,000 krillin is at 80,000.  They destroy the most part of the 
ginyu force.  So know Krillin is at 95,000 
Goten at 180,000, Goku at 185,000, and gohan at 190,000.  Goten powers up to 
kaio-ken times 2 and kills Capt.  Ginyu and is now at power level 190,000.   
Vegita shows up at level 180,000 and is surprised that they are all so much 
stronger than him.  Furiza is so mad that he skips guru and goes directly to 
them.  He beats them all up and they have to go to the rejuvination chaimber. 
    
<BR><BR>
    Krillin than goes to guru and unlocks his hidden power and goes up  to 
105,000.  He gets the dragon radar.  He finds all the dragon balls and wishes 
piccolo back to namek.  He faces off against freiza  and gains the upper hand 
until freiza goes to his 3rd stage he beats piccolo up.  When an hour passes 
the saiyans get out. There base levels are now 300,000, Goku is at 290,000.   
So gohan and gohan use their best and go kaioken times 25 to go up to 
7,500,000 Goku does the same and goes to 7,250,000.   
<BR><BR>
    They really start beating Freiza up so he goes up to a hundred percent of 
his power.  He beats all of them up.  Then to get more power he kills 
Krillin,  and laughs.  This sets off goku and he goes to ss1. He is at this 
point at level 14,500,000.  Freiza is also at level 14,500,000.  He then 
kills piccolo for the fun of it!  Gohan gets really mad and goes ss1 Goten 
does too.  They are at 15,000,000.  They learn to get control of it and are 
at 18,000,000 and goku is at 17,000,000.  They kill freiza once and for all.   
Guru never died so they wished for piccolo to be brought back, again. 
<BR><BR>
    They decide to go exploring.  They find the land of the yardrats and 
learn the instantaneous movement.  So their power advances to 23,000,000 
each.  Vegita goes off to train and dissapears.  Back on earth the z-teamers 
take on Garlic Jr.  They take him out and their power advances.  Know Piccolo 
is at 5,000,000 Tien at 4,000,000,and Krillin and Yamcha at 2,000,000.   
<BR><BR>
    Trunks comes w/ Gohan from the future(he survived the fight because he 
was way stronger)they kill King Kold.  When the saiyans arrive they show how 
strong they are.  F(future)gohan is stronger than all of them.  He mentions 
that Goten,  was killed when the android 16 self destructed on him and took 
all of the z-fighters with him. 
   <BR><BR>
    Vegita comes back and shows that his power level is now at 10,000,000.   
He starts training at 450times gravity.  Gohan, Goten, and Goku train 
toghether.  When 3 years have passed they are all done their power levels are 
30,000,000.  Vegita shows them his newly found power power of 20,000,000 then 
he goes ss1 and is also at 30,000,000.  Piccolo is at 20,000,000.  All the 
humans are at 15,000,000. 
<BR><BR>
    When the androids come there is only one android 19.  He takes on Piccolo 
and losing.  Dr. gero or 20  see's this and has to unlock 18, and 17.  They 
kill 20  and unlock 16.  In this time line Bulma made a scouter and read the 
androids levels.  18 was at 45,000,000, 17 was at 50,000,000, and 16 was at 
60,000,000 .  Gohan and Goten had to take 16 Goku and Vegita took 17 and 
Piccolo, and the humans took on 18.  F Gohan and f Trunks arrived just in 
time to save All the non saiyans.  All the rest of the saiyans got away with 
the instant transmission.  Korin gave them all senzu's and all the 
s.s.saiyans went up to level  40,000,000.  When Piccolo came he  fused with 
Kami to go to level 50,000,000.   
<BR><BR>
    The first two people to go in were Goku and Vegita.  While they went in 
Piccolo found Cell at level 55,000,000.  Mean while in the time chaimber Goku 
catches the virus but has the medicine so he quickly gets healed.  Piccolo is 
fighting Cell and a good fight it is.  Cell manages a Solar Flare and 
escapes.  At Kami's place everyone is training.  When the androids get to 
Goku's they find cell he absorbs 18 and goes to his second stage.  A day 
passes and Vegita and Goku get out.  They are both able to go U.SuperSaiyan 
and their max level is Goku 150,000,000 and Vegita 160,000,000.  They easily 
beat up Cell who is only at level 75,000,000.  But when vegita lets cell go 
Goku tries to stop him.  Cell absorb 17 and his base level is know 
180,000,000.  Goten and Gohan go in the chaimber and train.  He would kick 
but then mention the cell game.  When they left Goku would be steaming at 
Vegita.   
<BR><BR>
    When Gohan and Goten came out they were at Level 165,000,000 each.  Still 
not enough to take on Cell.  Goku told Gohan and Goten not to go in again.   
He went in with Vegita to become stronger.  This time Vegita came out way 
stronger than he was before.  By the time they came out they were at level 
200,000,000.  Unfortunetly while they were in the chaimber Cell absorbed 
2,000,000 people and went up to level 230,000,000.  Piccolo then went in with 
Tien they came out both at levels of 120,000,000.  Yamcha and Krillin went in 
and came out at 70,000,000 each.   
<BR><BR>
    When they went in for their second day piccolo and tien were at 
150,000,000 each and Yamcha and Krillin were at 100,000,000 each.  During the 
time they had in the chaimber everyone came up with additions to their moves. 
Goku learned how to gather energy from someone else to make his kamehameha.   
Vegita made his Final Flash attack  Gohan learned how to make a spirit bomb 
using plant life and electricity.  Goten learned how to store a lot of energy 
in an object and make it like a self distruct attack.  The future saiyans got 
out of the chaimber right before the games started.  They were each at levels 
as Gohan and Goten.   
<BR><BR>
    Finnaly the cell games.  Instead of just letting Mr. Satan go he just 
absorbs him.  Goku fairs off against Cell.  They are even for a while but 
then he see's that he can't win and gives up.  Vegita then goes in and the 
same thing that happened with goku happens.  Gohan is up next.  He goes 
against him then uses instant transmissions to fool with Cell.   
Cell finnaly announced somthing.  He said that he didn't go to Goku's just 
for the androids.  He told Gohan, Goku and, Goten to transport to the 
mountains where they fought 19.  There was ChiChi in a box.  Gohan finnaly 
fought him.  His and Gotens power went up to 220,000,000.  Goku did't rise 
because he didn't think Cell would do anything.  When Goten started attacking 
cell laughed and made 6 cell junior 3 for goten, 2 for goku and one for 
gohan.  When Gohan saw this he started attacking Cell, but the Cell Jr.   
Attacked him and held him down long enough to see Cell blow up the energy 
capsule Chichi was in.  Gohan exploded.  He went ss2 to level 440,000,000. 
He made a giant Static Bomb and disintegrated cell. 
<BR><BR>
       
        7 years later everyone is having a reunion at Master Roshi's.  Goku 
and his whole family are their.  Vegita comes with Trunks and Bulma all the 
humans are their. Plus their is another member of the Goku family.  His name 
is Goku jr.  who always hangs around with Trunks.  They are already at 
supersaiyan powerlevel  200,000,000. 

    Now that the world tournement is coming everyone has been training 
powerlevels are: <BR><BR>
Gohan:640,000,000 <BR>
Goten:590,000,000 <BR>
Goku:540,000,000 <BR>
Vegita:530,000,000 <BR>
Trunks:200,000,000 <BR>
Goku Jr.:200,000,000 <BR>
Piccolo:350,000,000 <BR>
Tien:300,000,000 <BR>
Krillin:200,000,000 <BR>
Yamcha:220,000,000 
<BR><BR>
    in the tournement Trunks won the junior tournement by beating Goku Jr..   
The Buu saga went by quickly because Piccolo was able to beat him up.  In the 
Bebi saga instead of Vegita getting possesed it was goku so gohan had to 
Gohan had to fuse with Goten to become Gotehan.  Then they went to ss3 Going 
up to 900,000,000 to beat Goku until Bebi had to leave.  The rest of Gt goes 
by because it is to easy to beat.

<b>What if...Goku killed Dr. Gero when he fought the Red Ribbon Army buring 
Dragon Ball? By:<a href="mailto:Flexaboy11@aol.com">Flexaboy11</a> </b>
<br>
Well first there would be no android/cell saga since there would be no Dr. 
Gero to create them.  No one 
would become that strong, since they had no reason to train.  Due to the lack 
of power, probabally no one 
would stand a chance against Buu, but if they did manage to get past him, 
they would have to deal with Bebi 
in GT.  They maybe be able to beat him, because Bebi only feeds on others 
brains to become strong .  If they 
manage to get past him.  There would be no Super 17 saga since there are no 
androids.  And because of this 
it might not lead to the Evil Shenron Saga, and every one would be OK.  But 
rember no one would get past 
Buu, so it would all end there.  Also no one would get higher then SSJ since 
they had no reason to train.   
Kuiriun would stay bald since #18 convinced him to grow hair(I think).  And 
Marron would not be born since 
once again there is no #18!  This just shows you how one casualty can 
completely mess around with the 
series.

<b> What if Frieza had killed Gohan as well as Krillin on Namek? By:<a href="Gurroro17@cs.com ">Gurroro17</a> </b>
<br>
Well, first Goku would get so pissed off that he would go straight to super 
Saiyan 2.  He would kick Frieza's butt easily, then tell King Kai to tell 
Kami(after they find out that he is alive) to summon Shenlon(the Earth 
Dragon) to bring back all those killed by Frieza and his henchmen.  Gohan 
would come back to life and be stronger than he was in the series.  Porunga 
would be summoned and transport everyone on Namek to Earth.  Goku does not 
learn Instant Transmission and when Garlic Jr. comes he is beaten easily.   
When King Kold comes(without Frieza) he is easily destroyed by Goku.  Trunks 
comes and the series goes as normal except that Cell is weaker without Frieza 
and Goku and Gohan are more powerful.

<b>What if Goku didn't die in his fight with Raditz?  By:<a href="hpratt1@ameritech.net">Hal Pratt</a> </b>
<br>
Well since the sayains were coming he'd be training with piccolo since there power levels are equal at this time. When the sayins come goku probably would be around Nappa's strength. so the Z fighters would defeat the Saibamen.  Then the Z fighters would take on Nappa and Win. then Vegeita would be next fighter since Goku  as no where near his strength and he didn't know kaioken or the Genki Dama (sprit Bomb) they'd have a hard time unless Krillin could slice hi with a destructo Disk they could win. but probably not. But if they did there would b e no need to go to Namek unless Piccolo dies probably not also so the freiza\namek\trunks Saga would disappear and then when GJ comes the world would be under control Garlic Junior. 
<BR><BR>


<b>What if Trunks (in the future) thought of asking king kai to bring dende 
to earth after he defeated the android s? By:<a href="mailto:IcecoldJV@aol.com">IcecoldJV</a> </b>
<br>
well, thats an easy one. Dende would make the dragon Balls and 
trunks would go get them and he could then wish for all people that were 
destroyed by the Androids to be alive again. That means Vegeta, Gohan, 
Piccolo, Krillin, Tien, Yamcha, Dr. Breifs, Chi-Chi, Puar, Master Roshi, 
etc. 
He could use the second wish to wish back Goku. Hello goku you are now back, 
these are new d-balls so he can wish whatever he wants from them. He could 
then wish for everything (buildings) destroyed by the droids to be back. 
Cell 
would be there and he would never be able to go to the past and get #17 and 
#18 because the Future Z warriors would have killed him sometime in there 
own 
time line. Trunks would have never come back to the Past. Our timeline that 
we know of would have never existed. and that is the end. 
<BR><BR>
<b>What if there was no such thing as Super saiyan? By:<a href="mailto:IcecoldJV@aol.com">IcecoldJV</a> </b>
<br>
Akira Toriyama would think of some other way for Goku and the rest 
to defeat the villians. Maybe like all of them be able to withstand Kaio 
Kenx20. Or maybe just make them become really strong by training. Goku and 
vegeta would never have beaten Majin Buu, well actually yeah they would 
have. 
Buu would be weaker because he absorbed NON super saiyans because there is 
no 
such thing. Then Buu would be wide open for gettin his butt whipped.
