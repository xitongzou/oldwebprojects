<b>-MEW- What if Vegeta went with the Z fighters to the lookout after the Cell Games?  
 </b>-Submitted by <a href="mailto:Steelcan93@aol.com ">Steelcan93</a>
<br>After 18 was healed and Gohan discovered Krillin's secret, Vegeta would 
immeadiatly critisize him. She would remember his strengh and run away. 
Vegeta would demand to resurrect Trunks so the first wish would be to revive 
all killed by Cell. The next wish would be for his (Vegeta's) immortality. So 
later on he cannot die when fighting Majin Boo.  



<b>What if Goku had given the heart virus to Gohan? ? 
 </b>-Submitted by <a href="mailto:Strwar4me@aol.com ">Strwar4me@aol.com </a>
<br>Goku and Gohan would die.  Trunks would be the only Z Fighter left after the 
androids killed Piccolo, Yamcha, Krillin, Tien, Chiaotzu, and Vegeta.  When 
he grew older, he would discover what had happened and be so ticked that he 
would go Super Saiyan.  He would battle the Androids and be defeated many 
times.  The Androids would get fed up with him interfering and would threaten 
to kill everyone on the planet.  Trunks would get ticked and go Super Saiyan 
2.  He would easily kill the Androids.  He would go back in time as soon as 
Bulma finished the Time Machine.  He would kill Frieza and King Kold.  He 
would tell Goku about the androids and give him two bottles of antidote for 
the virus: one for Goku, one for Gohan.  He would go back to the future.  He 
would loom for Dr. Gero's lab just in case any more Androids would show up.   
<br><br>
He would eventually find it and destroy everything, including the hidden 
bunker containing the larvae cell.  He would train for three years.  He would 
go back to help the Z Fighters.  He would kill the androids there with ease.   
Cell might still show up but would be easily killed by Trunks.  Trunks would 
return to the future.  He would live in peace fore the rest of his life.

<b>What if Future Gohan survived his fight with the Androids? ? 
 </b>-Submitted by <a href="mailto:Strwar4me@aol.com ">Strwar4me@aol.com </a>
<br>He would be extremely wounded.  He would fl with Trunks to Korin's to get 
more senzu beans.  Korin would give them the beans and tell them to train in 
the Room of Time and Spirit (Hyperbolic Time Chamber) to boost their power 
levels.  Trunks and Gohan would go up to Kami's and train there for a day in 
the R.O.T.A.S. (Room of Time and Spirit).  While in there, Trunks would go 
Super Saiyan.  Gohan would tap into his hidden power and go Super Saiyan 2.   
Both he and Trunks would go back in time and warn Goku about the Androids.   
<br><br>
Trunks and Future Gohan would kill the Androids in the future and go to the 
present and help the Z Fighters kill the Androids and Cell.  They would 
return to the future and kill Cell when he showed up.  The rest of the future 
would be peaceful.

<b>What if Goku had married Bulma? 
</b>-Submitted by <a href="mailto:Strwar4me@aol.com ">Strwar4me@aol.com </a>
<br>There would be no Gohan, but Goku would still have a strong son.  This son 
would do what Gohan did and get mad at Raditz for hurting Goku.  However, 
because Goku married Bulma instead of Chi Chi, who is stronger, this son 
would be weaker than Gohan.  When he head butted Raditz, nothing would really 
happen.  Raditz would kill everyone and blow up Earth.

<b>What if Pikkon was wished back by the Nameks during the 25th World 
Tournament? 
</b>-Submitted by <a href="mailto:Strwar4me@aol.com ">Strwar4me@aol.com </a>
<br>Pikkon would get another chance to fight Goku.  He would have improved a lot 
since the Other World Tournament.  Goku would still win the battle with his 
Super Saiyan 3 form.  Babidi, Boo, and Dabura would show up.  Pikkon would 
regain his strength with a senzu bean.  He, Goku, and Gohan would start to 
fight the three villains.  Gohan would easily defeat and kill Dabura.  Babidi 
would be dead within seconds against Pikkon.  Goku would be a lot stronger 
than Boo after the battle with Pikkon.  He would easily finish off Boo.  Goku 
would return to Other World.  Gohan would have Dende contact his fellow 
Nameks and have them wish Goku back.  Piccolo and Pikkon would live on 
Dende's Lookout.  When Pilaf would come to wish on the Dark Star Dragonballs, 
Pikkon would stop him and destroy the balls.  He and Piccolo would continue 
to train.  Bebi would arrive.  Pikkon would battle Bebi and easily kill him.   
Super 17 would show up later.  Pikkon would battle him.  Pikkon would manage 
to severely injure Super 17 but nothing more.  Pikkon would be left for dead. 
Piccolo would come and feed him a senzu bean.  Goku would arrive in Super 
Saiyan 3 form and fight Super 17.  He would not be strong enough to beat him. 
17 would kill people just out of spite for Goku.  Goku would be enraged and 
change into a Golden Ozarru.  Pikkon and Piccolo would be stunned.  Goku 
would stomp around and have to be calmed down by Piccolo and Pikkon.  Goku 
would calm down and go Super Saiyan 4.  He would easily kill Super 17.  The 
evil Shenlong saga would never take place.  Goku would stay alive.

<b>What if Bardock escaped the blast?  
 </b>-Submitted by <a href="mailto:Strwar4me@aol.com ">Strwar4me@aol.com </a>
<br>Bardock would have snuck aboard Frieza's ship.  He would have stolen a pod 
and flown to a planet with a regeneration chamber.  He would have healed.  He 
would have gone to different planets and stopped Frieza's men from conquering 
them.  He would have done this for years.  He would have overheard Raditz's 
transmission to Vegeta and Nappa about the dragonballs.  He would have 
traveled to Earth and met his grandson Gohan.  He would have trained with 
Piccolo and Gohan to battle Nappa and Vegeta.  He would have gotten stronger 
than Vegeta over the years.  Vegeta and Nappa would arrive on Earth.  Goku 
would be wished back.  Yamcha, Tien, and Chiaotzu would be killed by Nappa.   
Goku would arrive to see Bardock fighting Nappa.  Nappa would be humiliated.   
Bardock would kill Nappa.  Goku would ask who Bardock is.  Bardock would 
reveal that he is Goku's father.  Father and son would fight Vegeta.  Vegeta 
would feel that he would need a distraction to escape, so he would kill 
Piccolo.  Vegeta would escape.  Bulma, Krillin, Goku, Gohan, and Bardock 
would all go to Namek.  On the way there, Goku and Bardock would train at 
100X normal gravity.  Vegeta would heal and go to Namek.  The things he would 
do on Namek would not change except for the fact that he would not be able to 
steal Krillin's dragonball with Goku and Bardock around.  All of Frieza's 
henchmen would be dead.  The Ginyu Force would easily be taken care of.   
Picolo would be wished back and wished to Namek.  Guru would die.  Frieza 
would show up.  The battle for Namek would begin.  Bardock would be so 
enraged by seeing Frieza again, he would charge into battle and start beating 
Frieza.  Frieza would try to transform.  For a distraction, Frieza would 
shoot a beam of energy toward Krillin, lift him upm and kill him.  Goku would 
be really mad.  He would go Super Saiyan and kill Frieza.  Everyone, 
including Piccolo and Vegeta, would return to Earth.  The dragonballs there 
would be used to bring back all the Nameks killed by Frieza and his henchmen. 
The Nameks would wish Krillin back with the remaining wish.  133 days would 
pass, and Yamcha, Tien, and Chiaotzu would be wished back.  Another 133 days 
would pass, and Krillin would be wished to Earth.  Garlic Jr. would show up 
but would eventually end up back in the Dead Zone.  King Kold would come to 
Earth to get revenge for Frieza's death.  Goku would easily kill him.  Trunks 
would come from the future, tell Goku about the Androids, and go home.  The Z 
Warriors would train for three years.  During that time, Bardock's youth 
would be restored with the dragonballs.  Chi Chi would force Goku, Piccolo, 
and Bardock to take the driving test.  Bardock and Vegeta would learn how to 
go Super Saiyan. The day would come when the Androids would appear.  Goku 
would kill Android 19.  Android 20 would run away and go to his lab.  Vegeta 
would kill 20.  16 would try to kill Goku but would be blasted to pieces by 
Bardock.  17 and 18 would awaken and gang up on Goku.  Bardock and Vegeta 
would try to stop the Androids but would fail.  Seeing his grandfather and 
father hurt, Gohan would go Super Saiyan.  The Androids would continue to 
beat on Goku.  Gohan would become enraged and go Super Saiyan 2.  Before he 
could make a move, however, the other Z Warriors would try to take out the 
Androids.  They would easily be defeated.  Both Goku and Gohan would be mad.   
<BR><BR>
Goku would go Super Saiyan 2, and Gohan would go Super Saiyan 3.  The 
Androids would easily be destroyed.  Cell would show up.  Piccolo would fuse 
with Kami to fight Cell.  He would go and kill Cell.  Goku would go to train 
in the hyperbolic time chamber for a normal Earth day to try and become as 
strong as Gohan.  He would come out able to go Super Saiyan 3.  The 25th 
World Tournament would still take place.  It would come down to Chibi Trunks 
in first and Goten in second in the Junior Division.  Bardock would fight 
Vegeta in a battle that would give them enough power to go Super Saiyan 2.   
The fight would go on for a long time.  Bardock would get angry because of 
how long it was taking to beat Vegeta.  He would go Super Saiyan 3.  Vegeta 
would lose the match.  Gohan would fight his grandfather in Super Saiyan 3 
but would lose because of Bardock's superior tactics.  Goku and Bardock would 
fight.  Goku would beat Bardock because of his knowledge of kai attacks, his 
ability to create mirror images of himself, and his determination.  Babidi, 
Boo, and Dabura would show up.  All the Saiyans would attack at once and 
overcome them.  Babidi, Boo, and Dabura would easily be killed.  King Kai 
would congratulate Goku and ask if Earth needed a new guardian.  Goku would 
say yes, and King kai would go and get Dende. New dragonballs would be made.   
<BR><BR>
Pilaf would gather the new dragonballs and try to wish for world domination.   
Dende would have made the balls so they would only be able to grant a wish if 
he spoke it.  All of Pilaf's hard work would have been in vain.  Bebi would 
come to Earth and be defeated by all the Super Saiyans.  The universe would 
be a peaceful place from now on.

<b>What if Frieza killed Piccolo, then Krillin? 
 </b>-Submitted by <a href="mailto:Strwar4me@aol.com ">Strwar4me@aol.com </a>
<br>Killing Piccolo would be enough to make Goku and Gohan go Super Saiyan.   
Frieza killing Krillin would make them go Super Saiyan 2.  They would kill 
Frieza and go home.  There would be no dragonballs to wish the Nameks back 
with.  Piccolo, Krillin, Yamcha, Tien, Chiaotzu, all the Nameks, and Vegeta 
would be dead forever.  The Androids would show up and be defeated by Goku 
and Gohan.  Cell would also easily be killed.  Goku and Gohan would train.   
They would find a way to go Super Saiyan 3.  Boo would be released by Babidi 
and Dabura.  If Goku and Gohan attacked together in Super Saiyan 3 form or 
fused, Boo, Babidi, and Dabura would all easily be killed.  Bebi would come 
to Earth, though, and possess Goku or Gohan.  Bebi would kill the one not 
possessed and destroy Earth.
