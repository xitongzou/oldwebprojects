 </o:p>
 </b></span></font>&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Kaioshin
 first appears in DBZ in the Buu Saga, where he enters the 25<sup>th</sup>
 Tenkaichi Budoukai under the name Shin (which he continues to use in the dub).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He is soft-spoken and short of stature with elf-like ears, a white
 mohawk, and a purple complexion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Kaioshin is the last surviving deity of his kind, after Buu massacred
 the other Kaioshins and absorbed the Great Kaioshin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Kaioshin's first objective is to stop Babidi before he releases Buu
 from the ancient sphere in which Bibidi had sealed him millions of years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Kaioshin is very strong, but his power is limited when compared to
 fighters such as Goku, Vegeta and Gohan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Kaioshin aids the Z Senshi any way he can, mostly by teleporting people
 to different places and thus minimizing travel time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Later, Kaioshin fuses permanently with Kibit by way of the Potara
 earrings, an act which upgrades his power immensely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He then acquires Kibit's ability to heal a person near death, and with
 it aids the Z Senshi in battle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><b>Kami
 - "Kami Sama" (see Piccolo (Original), Piccolo Daimaou, Piccolo)<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </b></span></font>&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Kami
 is actually a title for the guardian of a particular planet, and the word
 literally translates to "God".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The Kami of Earth is the pure half of the original Piccolo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Hundreds of years before Dragonball began, the Namek who had forgotten
 his origins was chosen to succeed the old Kami as the new God of Planet Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>However, this Namek who called himself Piccolo was impure, and could not
 rise to the throne until he could cleanse his soul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The process of purifying Piccolo's soul actually caused him to
 literally split into two separate beings equal in wit and power:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>his dark half, who came to be called Piccolo Daimaou, or the Great Demon
 King Piccolo, and his pure side, who refers to himself only as Kami Sama.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The pure half of Piccolo ascended the throne of Kami in 431 AD and
 watched over the Earth, protecting it from evil powers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>His first objective as Kami was to stop his evil half, which was no
 simple task.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>After
 his creation, Piccolo Daimaou wreaked havoc across the Earth, and was virtually
 unstoppable even to Kami.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Although Kami was perhaps the strongest being on the planet at the time,
 even he could only equal Piccolo Daimaou in power, but never overcome him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Despite their separation, the two halves remained bound in spirit, and
 so they were still technically the same entity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>This fact also meant that if Piccolo Daimaou were destroyed, then Kami
 would also die with him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>It made for no easy solution, until finally in 461 AD, Daimaou was
 contained inside the magic Denshi Jar, where he was held captive for several
 hundred years.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="2"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </span></font></span></font><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Kami
 retains some special powers as Kami Sama, including certain powers over the
 spirit world, and can speak psychically with anyone he so chooses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He can sense whenever there is a disturbance on Earth, great or small.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>In the year 470, Kami creates Shenlong, the Dragon God of Earth, and the
 seven magical dragonballs that are scattered across the Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>When all seven dragonballs are gathered in one place, they give off an
 eerie glow of power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>When the one who collected them utters the words "Come out, Shenlong!",
 the great Dragon God appears before him or her, and grants that person a single
 wish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>The
 person may wish for anything he or she desires within the limits of Kami's
 power, because Kami was the creator of Shenlong and the dragonballs. <o:p>
 </o:p>
 </font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Kami
 lives in a beautiful, ancient palace on top of an incredibly high tower that
 defies logic, because it is balanced on a single thin pole (about the thickness
 of an oak tree).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The palace itself is referred to as Kami's Lookout.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Not far off from Kami's Tower is Korin's Tower, with Korin's house
 balanced on a similar thin pole and a few hundred meters lower.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>With the care of his faithful servant Mr. Popo, Kami resides atop the
 tower during his reign as Kami Sama, which lasts over 300 years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>In Dragonball, Kami trains Goku and teaches him everything he knows
 until Goku surpasses him in power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>When Goku dies in the beginning of DBZ, Kami assists him by persuading
 King Yamma to allow Goku to travel on Snake Way and train with King Kai.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Kami dies when Piccolo is killed by Nappa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>However, instead of simply dying, Kami fades into the spirit world,
 probably because of his spiritual powers as God of Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>When Kami dies, Shenlong perishes with him, and the Earth Dragonballs
 turn to stone and become useless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>However, Gohan uses the Namek Dragonballs to wish Piccolo back to life,
 thereby returning Kami to life as well, and restoring the power of the Earth
 Dragonballs.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="2"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></span></font><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </span>Much later in 767 AD, during the Android Saga, Piccolo and Kami both
 make the decision to fuse permanently in order to stand a greater chance
 against the androids and Cell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Kami consequently must give up his throne, and he is succeeded by the
 young Dende as the new Guardian of Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Kami and Piccolo rejoin their spirits into one body as the Namek without
 a name, the original Piccolo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The fusion creates a power increase so great that Piccolo is referred to
 as a "Super Namek".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Although the original Piccolo takes on the appearance of the younger
 half, internally he retains the memories and experiences of both Kami and
 Piccolo (along with Nail).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>After rejoining with Kami, Piccolo becomes more philosophical, and takes
 even more "heroic" actions that endanger his own life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>For example, he seals himself, Gotenks and Buu in the Room of Spirit and
 Time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>Later
 in GT, when the Blackstar Dragonballs are about to cause the planet to explode,
 he offers to stay on Earth and die with his own planet, rather than being
 teleported away with the rest of Earth's inhabitants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He does this primarily because of Kami's influence concerning his
 attachment to the planet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Like the captain who goes down with the ship, as Kami remains a part of
 Piccolo, he feels inclined to perish with the loss of his planet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Of course, he dies, and because he was once God, his soul rises to
 Heaven.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>However,
 with Goku later trapped in Hell, neither his ex-God half nor his ex-Demon King
 half can sit around and do nothing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Piccolo's more violent side kicks in, and he goes on a frenzy wreaking
 total havoc in Heaven until he is literally thrown out, at which point he
 willingly changes places with Goku in Hell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Piccolo remains in Hell until the end of GT.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Whether or not he is ever wished back (or if he wants to be) is left for
 the viewer to decide.<o:p>

 protect Kaioshin at all costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Kibit is fairly powerful, and has the ability to teleport and to heal
 someone near death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

 of Frieza and Cooler.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The common alternate spelling of his name is King Kold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He is much larger in size than Frieza or Cooler, and he stays in his
 second form for the entire duration of the saga.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>King Cold salvages Frieza's living remains from space and makes his
 scientists rebuild his son as a cyborg.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The two venture to Earth with plans to destroy Goku's home planet, but
 their scheme is foiled by the appearance of Trunks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>After watching Trunks kill his son and cut him to pieces, King Cold
 offers the Saiyajin an opportunity to replace Frieza and conquer the galaxy
 with him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>This
 statement is almost certainly a lie, considering King Cold had asked to see
 Trunks' sword moments before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He does this under the assumption that all of Trunks' power lies in
 his sword, and that he is weak without it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Trunks gladly hands him the sword, and fires a ki blast right through
 his chest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>Although
 in the dub version, King Cold pleads for mercy, in the original Japanese
 dialogue, he furthers his attempts to persuade Trunks to join him and achieve
 ultimate glory by conquering entire galaxies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Trunks flatly refuses and kills King Cold with a finishing blast.<o:p>

 of Worlds, King Kai is the Kai of the "North" quadrant of the galaxy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He is a powerful deity who lives on his own tiny planet at the end of
 Snake Way, a path that stretches over a million kilometers from King Yamma's
 palace to King Kai's planet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Every few generations, a dead warrior who is found to be strong enough
 is permitted to travel to King Kai's planet in order to train under the
 mighty God King.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>King Kai has the appearance of a short, plump blue catfish with antenna
 and wearing sunglasses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>In fact, all of the Kais wear sunglasses for some reason not clarified.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He also has an annoying voice with a particular lisp that makes it
 difficult to understand his words.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>His tiny planet seems to defy logic, as does almost everything in the
 Underworld.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>The
 sky is pink, but the sun is nowhere to be seen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The gravitational pull of the planet is about 10 times Earth's
 gravity, and causes everything to feel much heavier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>There are a few trees scattered around King Kai's house, and a small
 garage beside the house with the Lord of World's prized classic red sports
 car parked in the drive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The driveway is actually a narrow strip of pavement that goes in a
 complete circle around the planet (where else is he going to drive it?).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>In fact, all of the Kais appear to have a taste for wearing sunglasses
 (perhaps they have sensitive eyes) and a love of sports cars, including the
 Grand Kai, who has a gorgeous sports car parked in front of his palace.<o:p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">As
 a deity King Kai also has a few unique abilities, such as sensing ki
 frequencies from all parts of his end of the galaxy and telepathy with anyone
 he so chooses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He uses his long antenna to pick up frequencies of ki, planets, and
 people, and he is especially keen at sensing disturbances in the natural
 balance of the galaxy, just as Kami Sama somehow knows something is not right
 with the Earth.<o:p>

 Kai trains his pupils in a peculiar fashion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He begins by telling them to make him laugh with a joke, on the threat
 of no training.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Fortunately this is no difficult task, considering King Kai has not
 heard a decent joke for thousands of years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>His terrible attempts to be funny are only more proof that his long
 periods of solitude have given him a bizarre, lousy sense of humor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>King Kai also uses the strong gravitational pull of his planet, about 10
 times Earth's gravity, to train his students, and he orders them to complete
 silly tasks such as catching his "pet" monkey Bubbles, who resides on the
 planet with him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>In the animated series, he also has a pupil named Gregory who lives with
 him and helps to train his new students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

 God King had never found a student he felt was strong in mind and pure in heart
 enough to learn the Genki Dama until he met Goku.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

 part in the anime and the Bardock Special.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

 allowed Frieza to command his armies and give his people assignments to purge
 planets in return for pay and glory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </span>However, secretly the great ruler feared for his throne, his son and his

 several years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;

 </span>And so the king plotted to create a large revolt, in which he would
 gather the Saiyajin forces to fight together against Frieza and defeat him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Before this can be accomplished in full, however, Frieza acts first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>This scene is described in the anime, and portrayed with more detail in
 the Bardock Special.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Although it is never apparent, King Vegeta deeply cares for his son.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Before commanding the attack on Frieza, he makes certain that the prince
 Vegeta is safe on the opposite wing of the ship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>When he is assured of the prince's safety, King Vegeta boldly leads
 his Elite Army through Frieza's ship, destroying everything in his path as he
 storms into the tyrant's parlor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The king lunges at Frieza to attack him, but Frieza merely counters and
 with a single blow, he takes the life of the king Vegeta.<o:p>

 lord and judge of the dead in Japanese folklore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Enma Daio is a big red demon-looking guy with a thick, dark beard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He wears a business suit with a tie and a Viking-style hat with horns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He resides in his palace at the gates of the Underworld, where he sits
 at his desk and judges the souls of those who have died as they enter his
 palace in a line one by one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Because death never sleeps, neither does Enma Daio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He constantly sits at his desk judging dead souls without ceasing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He holds a large book in one hand that he uses to look up the life story
 of each soul that comes before him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The cover of this book apparently translates to "Who's Who".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Among the items on his desk are a giant coffee mug, name-plate which
 reads "The Hon. Enma" (Hon. meaning honorable) and, oddly enough, a
 giant-size rotary telephone complete with long cord stretching across one side
 of the palace floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>At one time in the past hundred million years, he traveled Snake Way to
 Kaio Sama's planet and trained under the Lord of Worlds (though where he
 found the vacation time is never specified).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Before Goku, Enma Daio is the only one that anyone can remember who
 successfully reached the end of Snake Way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>All lesser demons in the Underworld work for Enma Daio and answer to
 him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>Enma
 Daio is a bit short-tempered, which is quite believable considering his
 occupation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>This
 makes him all the more intimidating, even to Kami Sama.<o:p>

 built thousands of years ago, supported only by a thin pole about the thickness
 of an oak tree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The tower is located right beside Kami's Tower, which is a few hundred
 meters higher than Korin's Tower.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>It is a popular misconception to assume the towers are connected, as
 they are rarely shown together from a distance as separate towers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The 800-year-old cat deity is just below the rank of Kami, and is a
 master of martial arts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Although he is a minor character in DBZ, he plays a much more important
 role in Dragonball.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Goku comes to Korin seeking the Super Holy Water, which according to
 legend makes the drinker stronger and faster than ever before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Korin tells the boy that he will give him the Holy Water when he can
 defeat Korin in combat and snatch the bottle from his paws.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

 Tower and being forced to climb it one more time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The tower is so high that it takes Goku just over a day to climb it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>After 3 days of this, Goku finally manages to beat Korin and take the
 bottle of Holy Water from him, only to find that the water is nothing special
 at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>Korin
 informs him that he is already much stronger and faster than before, because of
 the intense work he put into the process of taking the water from him in the
 first place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>Korin
 does in fact have special water, a kind that greatly increases the drinker's
 powers, called Super God Water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The catch is simply surviving it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Drinking a single drop of the Super God Water nearly kills Yajirobe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

 </span>Korin's Tower is the only place in the world they are grown, and so
 these magic beans are quite valuable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The senzu beans are used frequently in DBZ to restore energy in battle,
 and many a time they save the lives of the Z Senshi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The beans are limited in number and are difficult to grow, and so Korin

 is also arguably the strongest human in DBZ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
