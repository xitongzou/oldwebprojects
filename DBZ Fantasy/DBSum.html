            <p align="left">In the opening seen we see Goku rolling though the 
              forest on a large log. As he gets home he throws the log in the 
              air and chops it up. As this is going on we are introduced to Bulma 
              (we get to see her, but not know her name). Goku is then inside 
              of his house and he is talking to the four star<br>
              dragonball in which he thinks his grandpa's spirit is in. Goku then 
              goes off to catch a fish. As Goku is walking through the forest 
              he jumps up into a tree and eats two apples. He throws one of the 
              apples and hits a bobcat on the head. The bobcat then chased him 
              but was no match for Goku and the Bobcat fell off of a cliff. Goku 
              then slipped and fell off, buy into the river he was looking for. 
              As Goku gets out of the water and is drying off he sticks his tail 
              into the water so he can catch a fish. Just then a giant fish jumps 
              for Goku's tail, but as it is about to bite Goku, Goku turns<br>
              around and kicks the fish. He then jumps into the water and grabs 
              the fish. As Goku is walking home he hears a noise and stops. Out 
              of no where Bulma in her air car shows up and hits Goku and his 
              car. Goku jumps up and<br>
              tries to beat up Bulma. Bulma then gets out of the car and tells 
              Goku that she is human. Bulma then explains that she is a girl and 
              Goku comments that he has never seen a girl, but his grandpa told 
              him about girls. Goku then lifts up Bulma's skirt looking for her 
              tail. Bulma then ponders whether all<br>
              boys have tails since she has never seen one with no pants on. Goku 
              invites Bulma back to his house and Bulma wonders if Goku has the 
              Dragonball she is looking for. On the way to Goku's home the two 
              get to know each others names and Goku makes fun of Bulma for her 
              name. When they get back to Goku's house Bulma sees Goku's dragonball 
              and tries to convince Goku to give it too her. Bulma then shows 
              Goku that his ball is not a one of a kind, she then explains to 
              Goku what the dragonballs can do when all gathered.</p>
            <p>At this same time we are introduced to Lord Pilaf. He has just 
              found a Dragonball and we see his thoughts of what his wish will 
              be (world-domination). Lord Pilaf needs to be told that there are 
              seven dragonballs and having just one is no good, though.</p>
            <p>Bulma eventually convinces Goku to be her partner so she can get 
              his dragonball eventually, she also feels he will be a great body 
              guard. Bulma opens up a capsule from which came a motorcycle. Goku 
              of course needs to be told that it is not a monster and he then 
              gets on. So Bulma and Goku go speeding away. Bulma flies over a 
              hill and almost crashes. Bulma then stops to go to the bathroom, 
              she runs behind a rock and the yells for Goku. As Goku runs over 
              we see a large flying dinosaur that is holding onto Bulma.<br>
              Goku does not realize that the flying dinosaur is a bad guy and 
              allows himself to be ties up. As the dinosaur flies away Goku slips 
              out of the ropes and hops on the motorbike to chase after Bulma. 
              Goku flies over a hill and is almost to Bulma when he begins to 
              fall to Earth, so he jumps,<br>
              but comes up short. As he is falling again he pulls out his power 
              pole and hits the flying dinosaur who drops Bulma. Bulma starts 
              to fall so Goku throws his poll which hits Bulma and causes to stick 
              to the side of the mountain. Goku then gets Bulma and they go off 
              to look for the dragonballs. Gokuh and Bulma are riding on the motor 
              cycle when Bulma stops to rest for the night. She takes out one 
              of here capsules and makes a house appear. Once the two of them 
              get inside Gokuh is amazed by the lights and the TV. Bulma notices 
              thought that Gokuh smells really bad so she tells him to take a 
              bath. Gokuh has no idea what a bath is though so Bulma is forced 
              to give him one. Bulma is giving Gokuh his bath when she tells him 
              to take off his<br>
              tail. Bulma pulls on the tail, but since it is a real tail Gokuh 
              yells in pain. He then uses his tail to wash his back. Bulma cannot 
              believe that Gokuh's tail is real. She then questions whether all 
              boys have tails. Bulma then goes to take a bath, but is interrupted 
              when Gokuh enters and says<br>
              that he has come to wash Bulma's back. Bulma tries to maintain her 
              temper, but when Gokuh says that she is jealous because she does 
              not have a tail she flips and throws everything in the bathroom 
              at him.</p>
            <p>At Lord Pilaf's castle Pilaf is talking to Shou about the Dragonballs 
              when Pilaf has a little gas problem. Pilaf then tells Shou that 
              he was the one who did it. When Shou does not agree Pilaf has mechanical 
              hands come from<br>
              the ceiling and floor that grab Shou and then Pilaf has a chainsaw 
              and is about to cut up Shou when Shou promises to bring back a DB 
              and says that he will never fart is Pilaf's presence again. Agent 
              Myu then enters the room and tells Lord Pilaf that a mysterious 
              glow has been spotted in a place called Skull Valley, we also learn 
              that no one has ever visited Skull Valley and returned. Pilaf then 
              tells Myu to take Shou and to go see what the mysterious glow is. 
              Meanwhile, Gokuh goes out to find some food.<br>
              Gokuh decides that the giant centipede he has isn't big enough when 
              all of a sudden he spots Myu's ship which looks like a bird. The 
              plane is flying to Skull Valley. When it lands Myu and Shou get 
              out. Gokuh comes jumping down<br>
              behind them to tell them to get away from his bird. Myu and Shou 
              then find out that the glowing was the eyes of wolves and out of 
              no where a giant pack of wolves jump out. Gokuh easily beats them 
              all up and then chases after<br>
              the plane. He causes the plane to crash, but after hitting it he 
              comes to the conclusion that the &quot;bird&quot; is not edible. 
              So Gokuh goes back to the house with his centipede and a wolf. He 
              offers some to Bulma, but she is grossed out. Gokuh eats the food 
              and then goes inside. Before going to<br>
              bed Bulma question's Gokuh about his grandfather and his tail, but 
              doesn't learn much. The next morning Gokuh wakes up and goes outside 
              to exercise. Gokuh finds a giant tortise and then Bulma comes out. 
              After giving the turtle some salt water Gokuh says that he will 
              take the lost turtle back to the sea. Bulma is mad and doesn't go 
              with Gokuh. Bulma though sees a giant dinosaur and changes her mind. 
              She catches up with Gokuh and the three of them go off in search 
              of the sea</p>
