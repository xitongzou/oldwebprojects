This game is based on the anime and manga Dragon Ball Z. 

The modes on the title screen are:

Story Mode: Choose a character and go through the Cell Game, then DBZ 
Movie 9 and (if you meet a certain criteria) DBZ Movie 10. The choices 
are really only relevant to the story and not to the game, so you don't 
need to know Japanese to play.

VS. Mode: There are three subsections.
1P vs. 2P
1P vs. CP (the opponent is chosen randomly)
CP vs. CP

After the character is chosen, you have a set of choices.

Life-Press left and right to change the amount to anything between 400 
(two full energy bars) and 10 (one hit needed to defeat you). This is 
the handicap.
Attack Power-Light or hard. It's set on light. Another handicap option.
Game Rank-1 (easy) to 4 (hard)
Background-Choose the stage
Music-Choose the music

Tenkaichi Budokai (tournament)
Up to 8 players can compete. Any number of those may be human
controlled. All fighters that are not human controlled are automatically 
controlled by the computer. Press start when you choose the last 
character you want to be human controlled.

Options:
Sound-Stereo or Mono. Default is Stereo.
Music Test-self-explanatory
Sound Test-Self-explanatory

Battleground:
At the start of the fight, both fighters are on the same screen. If you 
get too far away from your opponent, the screen splits vertically. If 
you fly to a different level than your opponent, the screen splits 
vertically.

Raising your ki:
Press Y + B to raise your character's ki. This will make your character 
bend back and flare with ki. Meanwhile, your ki meter will increase.

Stuns:
If you throw a ki attack that you don't enough power to use, you'll 
throw the attack, but you'll be stunned a little while afterward. You 
can also stun yourself by throwing several kikouhas in a row. You will 
be stunned, no matter how much ki you you have. You can stun your 
opponent by hitting him with a few powerful attacks.

Super Blasts:
Each character has two super blasts. If the two fighters are close 
together, the attacker will charge for a little bit and then fire a 
large ball of energy. If the two fighters are far apart or on different 
levels, the screen will cut to the person charging up the blast until he 
fires. The screen will then cut to the defending fighter, who has four 
options which are:

Guard: B + A Buttons
The defender shields him or herself with their arms. Takes 50% damage.

Repel: Back, Down-Back, Down + A Button
The defender catches the blast and then deflects it away. Takes 25% 
damage.

Disperse: Forward, Back, Forward + A Button
The defender uses a ki shield to stop the attack. Takes no damage but 
the ki meter is reduced.

Counter: Down, Down-Back, Back, Forward + A Button
The defender fires a blast, meeting the attacker's blast. To overpower 
the attacker's blast, press the Y, B and A buttons repeatedly.

Super Meteo Attacks:
These moves do a lot of damage, but use no ki. They may only be executed 
on the lower level of the stage. All Super Meteo Attacks require you to 
be close to your opponent. Note: Cell Jr. does not have a Super Meteo 
Attack.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Fighting Strategies
------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, a general (every character) tip:

-If your opponent is stunned and in the air, hit him/her with a super 
blast. If they're on the ground while stunned, hit them with the Super 
Meteo Attack.

----------
Son Gohan
----------

Gohan's most effective weapon is his string of punches. They are quick 
and can do significant damage. Also, if the final punch hits, then the 
opponent is knocked down. The Diving Kicks can be used as a surprise 
attack.

Gohan's normal attacks don't have much range, so you'll have to fight in 
close. If you must fight a firefight, then fire the large ball of ki. It 
does a good deal of damage and is difficult to dodge.

----------
Vegeta
----------

In general, your most effective weapon is the string of three hits. 
Don't overuse this, but use it when your opponent is landing from a jump 
or isn't expecting it. Always follow it up with the dashing elbow. Use 
the Bakuretsu Ha to catch charging opponents off-guard. The Kienzan is 
the most useless weapon you have. Don't use it often. And finally, don't 
underestimate the usefulness of the Renzoku Energy Dan. The third blast 
lags behind, so it can hit opponents who stop blocking after the first 
two shots.

The range of Vegeta's normal attacks isn't great, so you must fight in 
close. Use hit-and-run tactics to strike quickly.

----------
Trunks
----------

Trunks' main strength lies in his kicks. He gets great range on all of 
them, particularly the jumping kick and the Super Sliding kick. Don't be 
afraid to mix up the Super Sliding Kick with a normal sliding kick 
(Down+B). Also, the Pump Kick (Toward+B) can surprise opponents.

As for Trunks' ki attacks, they all use a great deal of energy, so 
constantly power up if you're fighting a firefight. The tri-blast will 
cut through everything but superblasts, so it is a good option up close. 
The shockwave is also a good option as it can catch opponents off guard.

----------
Piccolo
----------

Like Trunks, Piccolo's main strength is his kicks. His standing kick 
will keep most opponents away, and if it doesn't work, use the Dashing 
Kicks to knock them down. A good mix-up tactic to use is to jump and 
kick your opponent on the way up and then use the Diving Kicks on the 
way down.

Most of Piccolo's ki attacks are useless, except as surprise attacks, so 
use them sparingly.

----------
Cell
----------

Cell's best overall attack is his standing kick. It has great range and 
always knocks down. A nice attack to use is the two-hit string and then 
a standing kick. If the string is blocked, then the final kick can still 
hit your opponent and knock them down. 

Cell's ki attacks are a mixed bag. The Renzoku Energy Dan is a great 
move and can be deadly if preceded by the Taiyoken. The barrier of ki 
can harm attacking opponents, but it doesn't have much of a use 
otherwise.

----------
Cell Jr.
----------

Cell Jr. is almost completely useless. His attacks have little range, 
but he is small and quick. Use both of these facts to your advantage. 
Stay low to the ground and attack with either kicks or try the Diving 
Kicks.

Also, you must attack with ki attacks if you wish to win. The Kienzan 
and Renzoku Energy Dan can catch opponents off-guard and the Energy Dan 
can juggle your opponent.

----------
Zangya
----------

Zangya's bread and butter are her strings of hits. The string of punches 
followed by a diving kick can usually get at least two hits off of a 
surprised opponent. The string of kicks is slower, but each kick is 
deadly.

Zangya's normal attacks aren't the greatest in the game, but they aren't 
horrible. Her standing kick can counter most charging attacks and her 
punch in close can surprise opponents. However, if the punch is blocked, 
you are left wide open to attack.

----------
Bowjack
----------

Bowjack's standing kick is a great weapon as it counters most charging 
attacks and knocks down everyone. His strings are mostly just two-hit 
attacks, but they are quick. The knee after the sliding can catch 
opponents offguard easily if they do not know it's coming. The Bicycle 
Kick is a valuable tool as it can easily knock opponents away. 

----------
Son Goku
----------

Goku's seven-kick string makes him a great fighter. Even if blocked, it 
still does a great deal of damage, and you are in position to strike 
quickly after it. Goku's two-hit string and the Scissor Kick can be used 
to surprise and damage charging opponents.

Goku's normal attacks make him mainly a close-range fighter. Use one of 
the strings to get in close and then dominate inside.

----------
Brolly
----------

Brolly is easily the best fighter in the game. All of his normal 
standing and jumping attacks knock down. You'll want to use his string 
of kicks sparingly as it's easily blocked and when it is, Brolly is wide 
open to attack. Don't bother using clotheslines against the smaller 
fighters such as Son Gohan and Cell Jr.. Use the Bakuretsu Ha to catch 
opponents off-guard.

Use standing attacks to keep opponents out of range and to knock them 
down.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Battle Chart
------------------------------------------------------------------------

By using the CPU vs. CPU option on the VS. menu, I had each warrior 
fight each other in an attempt to see which one was the best overall. 
The results are as follows.

1=Son Gohan
2=Vegita
3=Trunks
4=Piccolo
5=Cell
6=Cell Jr.
7=Zangya
8=Bowjack
9=Son Goku
0=Brolly

A '\' means not applicable (I didn't have mirror image fights), a 'o' 
means a win and a 'x' means a loss.

To find who won where, find the number on the left that corresponds to 
the first fighter, and go right until it meets the column with the 
number of the opponent. For instance, Trunks defeated Son Gohan, but 
lost to Piccolo.

  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
1|\|x|x|o|o|o|x|x|x|o|
2|o|\|o|o|o|o|o|x|x|x|

9|o|o|o|o|o|o|o|o|\|x|
0|x|o|o|o|o|o|o|o|o|\|

Tied for 1st: Son Goku (8-1) and Brolly (8-1)

These two won most of their matches due to their ridiculously long 
chains of attacks. In fact, Brolly pretty much dominated everyone, but 
was upset by Son Gohan. When Son Goku and Brolly fought, it was all 
Brolly.

3rd: Bowjack (7-2)

Bowjack fought valiantly and only had trouble with Goku, Brolly and 
Cell. The bicycle kick proved to be very useful.

4th: Vegeta (6-3)

Vegeta's chain of hits helped him win several fights. A variety of ki 
attacks also proved useful.

Tied for 5th: Son Gohan (4-5) and Cell (4-5)

Both of these people used speed and charging attacks. Gohan's size 
proved vital when he fought Brolly as just about all of his attacks went 
over his head.

Tied for 7th: Trunks (2-7), Piccolo (2-7), Cell Jr. (2-7) and Zangya 
(2-7)

Nothing much to say about these people. Zangya requires a large amount 
of speed and finesse. Cell Junior's size helped him win a few matches.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Secrets
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To be able to play as Son Goku and Brolly in the VS. and Tenkaichi 
Budokai modes, press Up, X, Down, B, L Button, Y, R Button and X as 
Gohan is flying toward Kami's Lookout. You should hear Brolly say 
"Kakarotto." (sound 5D in the sound test)
