            <p>Saiya-jin Saga</p>
            <p>The saga starts off at the arrival of Radditz. Radditz explained 
              Goku of his true origin. That he was a space soldier sent to Earth 
              to make it presentable for purchase when he was young. Goku refused 
              to join him, so Radditz kidnapped Goku's son, Gohan. Goku had no 
              choice but to fight him. He joined forces with Piccolo and fought 
              Radditz, Radditz lost the fight and died, but Goku sacrificed his 
              life to win the battle and then he was off to find Kaiousama, the 
              greatest martial arts fighter.<br>
              <br>
              Piccolo then kidnapped Gohan for training because Gohan injured 
              Radditz during the battle. Then everyone trained for a year. Nappa 
              and Vegita heard about the Dragon Balls through Piccolo, and then 
              they plan on going to Erath to find them and wish for immortality. 
              Nappa took care of<br>
              almost all the Z warriors, except for Krillen and Gohan. Then Goku 
              came and beat the hell out of Nappa. Vegita then killed Nappa, and 
              then Vegita and Goku fought. Vegita lost the first round and transformed 
              to the giant Oozaru. He then beat up Goku and later Gohan and Krillen 
              came back to fight Vegita. Then the coward Yajerobe cut off his 
              tail, and Vegita turned back to normal. Gohan then later turned 
              to Oozaru form and beat up Vegita. Vegita lost so he retreated back 
              at Freezer's command post.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Freezer Saga</p>
            <p> The saga starts out when the crew (Gohan, Bulma, and Kurririn) 
              get in Kamasama's old spaceship and head off towards Namek. Goku 
              not going because he's too injured during the battle with Vegita. 
              The crew first landed on a<br>
              fake Namek, 4 episodes later they're on the real Namek. Right after 
              they got there, surprise surprise, Vegita shows up and the crew 
              gets scared. Now Goku is on a spaceship heading towards Namek. Freezer 
              and company had 5 Dragon Balls, Vegita has 1, the Crew has 1 also. 
              Vegita steals from the crew, the crew steals from Vegita. Vegita 
              gets ultra pissed and finds the crew. While that happens, Krillen 
              and Gohan get major charges from Guru, the Namek Elder. The Ginyu 
              shows up, so Gohan, Kuririn, and Vegita join forces to battle the 
              Ginyu. They take care of Guldo, no problem, but get stuck on Reccoom. 
              Reccoom takes out everybody. Is all hope lost...?<br>
              <br>
              Goku arrive's at the battlefield and very well easily defeats Recoome. 
              Goku does what the entire group couldn't, deafeat Recoome. The way 
              that Goku easily beat the seemingly invincible Recoome, Vegita gets 
              the idea that Goku could be the...Legendary Super Saiya-Jin? Next 
              Goku takes on Burter and Jeice. Goku plays with them and then defeats 
              Burter , Jeice runs away to<br>
              find Captain Ginyu. The renewed Vegita then finishes off Burter 
              and Recoome. Goku gets mad and asks, &quot;What did you go and do 
              that for?&quot; Vegita then explains the evil and ruthlessness of 
              Freezer and his men. Meanwhile Jeice<br>
              finds Ginyu, who has came up with a new pose, but unable to use 
              it since most of the Ginyu Force is dead. This enrages Ginyu and 
              he flys off to find Goku. Gohan and Kurririn fly off to get the 
              Dragon Balls, Goku and Vegita<br>
              are left to spar with Captain Ginyu and Jeice. Vegita tricks Goku 
              and flys off to leave Goku to fight the remaining Ginyu Force members. 
              Ginyu fights around with Goku, they seem to be evenly strong, until 
              Ginyu realizes that Goku<br>
              wasn't using his full stength, so he ask's Goku to show his full 
              power...big mistake! Ginyu freaks out at how much stronger Goku 
              is than him. Ginyu is afraid of the mythological Legendary Super 
              Saiya-Jin! Goku shows some compassion and gives Ginyu a chance to 
              escape, this leads Ginyu to thinking that Goku hasn't reached Super 
              Saiya-Jin...yet! The evil Ginyu then wounds himself badly...why? 
              Ginyu had a special move Goku didn't know about, the ability to 
              switch bodies! Ginyu then switch bodies with Goku. Goku is now left 
              helplessy alone, and with no knowledge on how to use the new body. 
              Ginyu then finds Gohan and Kurririn, and kill them! Ginyu doesn't 
              know how to use Goku's body, so gets badly beaten by Gohan and Kurririn. 
              But as time passes, Ginyu figures out how to use Goku's body and 
              begins fighting back.<br>
              Vegita shows up and kills Jeice, then sets his sites on Ginyu (in 
              Goku's body) Vegita beats the hell out of Ginyu...Now Ginyu wants 
              Vegita's body! Ginyu tries to switch with Vegita, but fails and 
              switches with...a frog? Yes, Ginyu has now switched into the body 
              of a useless frog! Goku's badly injured so he went to recooperate 
              in Freezer's ship. Gohan and Kurririn gets new armor, as well as 
              Vegita.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Here is where business picks up a bit. Kuririn goes to find Dende, 
              who will hopefully know the password to the Dragonballs. Meanwhile, 
              Vegita starts taking a nap, and Gohan is guarding the Dragonballs. 
              Dende is also looking<br>
              for Kuririn and Gohan, trying to deliver the password to them, and 
              spots the headless Gurudo (if you watch the US Dragonball Z, you 
              do not see Gurudo gets his head chopped off by Vegita, he gets killed 
              by a laser instead).<br>
              Dende becomes scared while he's flying down towards Gurudo, who 
              he thinks is Kuririn. About 5 minutes later, Kuririn and Dende meet 
              up, and head back to Furiza's ship. Just to be sure they won't wake 
              Vegita, Dende, Kuririn, and Gohan take the balls to an island not 
              too far away, and Denda summons the Eternal Dragon, Porunga. The 
              first wish they try to make is to wish back the Z Senshi that died 
              during the Vegita saga. Porunga denies the request,<br>
              stating that only one person can be wished back at a time. At Kaio-sama's 
              planet, Tenshinhan, Yamcha, and Chaot-zu are arguing over who should 
              be the one to leave. Of course Piccolo has a brillant idea, wish 
              him back, and Kami-Sama will be back on the Earth, as well as the 
              Dragon Balls! So,<br>
              Piccolo contacts Gohan telepathically through Kaio-sama, telling 
              Gohan to wish him back. The second wish is to wish Piccolo to the 
              Namek, which is also granted, unfortunatley, he is not teleported 
              to their current location, which is bad, because trouble's on the 
              way.... Vegita shows up, and some problems go underway, and Furiza 
              shows up, and the huge battle starts. I will only cover the major 
              events of the battle here, The highlight events include Kuririn 
              almost dieing, Gohan beating up Furiza 2nd form, Piccolo beating 
              Furiza second form, Gohan making Furiza 3rd form transform again 
              with a Masenko blast, Dende dieing, Kuririn dieing, Gokou going 
              SSJ, Gokou winning. That about covers the major part.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Android Saga<br>
              There was an evil force coming to earth,it was Freeza, he did not 
              die from the explosion of Namek or Goku's ki blast. He was not the 
              only one who was coming., Freeza's father, King Cold, was coming 
              too, he was even stronger than Freeza. Freeza had been blown up 
              pretty well and over half of his body was missing. He was given 
              a android body, so most of us call him Freeza Bot. Vegeta warned 
              everyone of this great danger, they showed up where Vegeta said 
              they probably would. Freeza's ship arrived, and Freeza gave the 
              word to kill all of the earthlings. As soon his men went to do that, 
              his men fell into pieces at the ground, as if they had been sliced. 
              Then a young boy named Trunks landed, he pissed off Freeza a bit 
              (by talking trash) and then claimed he was a Super Saiyajin. He 
              turned SSJ (to prove that he was a Saiyajin). Freeza was reminded 
              of the fight with Goku on Namek, so he became enraged and attacked 
              Trunks. Trunks would say stuff like, &quot;If that was your best 
              then you are weak.&quot; Just to piss him off. Freeza went to attack 
              Trunks again, but then Trunks was gone... then Freeza heard Trunks 
              scream, &quot;FREEZA!!&quot; and Trunks shot at Freeza. Freeza just 
              dodged it, but as he looked up Trunks was right behind him coming 
              at him<br>
              with his sword drawn! Trunks sliced Freeza in half. As all this 
              was happening the rest of the z-team watched from a cliff peak. 
              Trunks then slashed Freeza into about 70 different pieces, they 
              where just floating in<br>
              the air. Trunks then shot a ki blast at the floating pieces, burning 
              them to ash. Then he killed King Cold with ease. He met up with 
              the z-team, he told them, &quot;I'm going to meet Son Goku! Want 
              to come?&quot; It was odd, he knew exactly where Goku would arrive, 
              they waited and waited, then Goku arrived! Trunks then told Goku 
              in private that he was from the future, and that there where going 
              to be 2 androids wrecking havoc on earth. Goku wanted to fight them, 
              but then Trunks told Goku that before that would happen he would 
              die of a heart virus. He then gave Goku a little bottle of pills 
              and told him to take them when he felt the signs of the heart attack. 
              Goku was going to be saved! Trunks then left. The Z-team trained 
              for 3 years till the day arrived<br>
              when they had to fight the androids. They where all much stronger 
              than they where before. They found the androids, they where #19 
              and #20. #20 almost killed Yamcha (by sticking his hand right through 
              this stomach). Then they<br>
              went off to a remote island to fight. Vegeta had not shown up yet. 
              They had information on everyone there, ever since Goku destroyed 
              the Red Ribbon army they had collected data on them, they stopped 
              collecting data since Goku<br>
              fought Vegeta. Goku had a trick up his sleeve... He showed them 
              the power of the Super Saiyajin! He started fighting #19. Goku was 
              winning for a bit, then he started having to gulp for air, he was 
              having his heart attack. #19 had the advantage and started using 
              a little red ball in his palm to suck energy out of Goku. Goku was 
              getting weak. Then out of nowhere #19 got a kick to the face (a 
              fat face =P). It was Vegeta, he told Goku that if anyone was going 
              to kill him, it had to be himself. Yamcha took Goku too Chi Chi<br>
              and the pills that Trunks had given them. Vegeta told the androids 
              that they did not know what they where dealing with. He said that 
              he was able to go Super Saiyajin as well. With a blast of rage Vegeta 
              turned SSJ. He then whooped #19. #19 tried to steal Vegeta's power 
              by grabbing his arms. #19 only got his arms ripped off. He started 
              running away from Vegeta, but Vegeta rose into the sky and said, 
              &quot;This is what I call 'Super Vegeta's BIG BANG ATTACK!!!&quot; 
              and shot a ball of ki at #19. #19's body blew up at his head was 
              separated from his body, he was dead. #20 was afraid and thought 
              he needed more help, so he started running off into the cliffs. 
              Trunks then arrived at the battlefield and saw that fat white head 
              on the ground (#19's<br>
              head). He said that they have been fighting the wrong androids the 
              whole time. They left to follow #20. He hid for a while then made 
              it out to his lab, he was really the creator of all the androids, 
              his name was Dr. Gero. They followed him to his lab, when they got 
              there it was too late, the<br>
              Androids killed Dr. Gero. One looked like a young boy and one looked 
              like a pretty girl. The androids (#18 and #17) saw another android 
              locked up in a chamber. They where about to unlock the chamber, 
              but Trunks saw that they where about to let another android loose 
              so he flipped and blew the lab up. The other android was still in 
              his chamber and the other androids where not even scratched. They 
              let the other android out, he was HUGE! His name was #16. He didn't 
              talk a lot and he was peaceful. They then flew away from the Z-team 
              (To find Son Goku). Then Vegeta went to follow them and Trunks tried 
              to stop him, Vegeta hit Trunks out of the way and flew where the 
              androids flew. #17 (the boyish one) said they should stop and look 
              for a car to ride, they where in no hurry. So they stopped at a 
              main road and waited. Vegeta then arrived and then a fight started 
              between #18 (the pretty girl) and<br>
              Vegeta. Vegeta seemed to be winning at first, but then #18 said 
              she would use more power. She beat Vegeta down! Then the rest of 
              the Z-team arrived and started to fight. #17 joined in too. By the 
              time the androids where done with the z-team, the z-team had broken 
              arms, backs and so on and so on. Kuririn gave them each a senzu 
              after the androids left. Vegeta took of, his pride was hurt more 
              than he was (being beaten by a girl). Then Kuririn said, &quot;Ah, 
              Piccolo, I'm sure glad you're on our side now.&quot; Piccolo then 
              got<br>
              enraged and yelled, &quot;I AM THE ARCH DEMON PICCOLO! I HAVE JUST 
              BEEN USING YOU SO I CAN TAKE OVER THE EARTH!&quot; He shot a blast 
              at the floor and flew away. Kuririn laughed and said that Piccolo 
              was just bluffing. He pointed out that Piccolo flew towards Kamisama's 
              palace. He said that they where going to<br>
              become one again so Piccolo could have lots of strength and beat 
              the androids. Was Piccolo going to fuse with Kamisama for good? 
              Even if he did could he beat the androids? You'll have to wait and 
              read the next saga summery &quot;The Cell Saga&quot;</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Cell Saga</p>
            <p> Piccolo and Kamisama fused, Piccolo was stronger than any of the 
              z-team now! Kami told Piccolo about something worse than the androids, 
              &quot;Cell&quot;. Piccolo flew to where he saw Cell and fought him. 
              Cell had killed a whole city already. He sucked out the people's 
              cells through his tail. He sucked some of Piccolo's Cells too. Cell 
              could even do Piccolo's moves!! He got that ability from Piccolo's 
              cells. Piccolo finds out that Cell needs the androids to become 
              Super Perfect, then breaks free and fights Cell some more. Then 
              Cell goes off to find the androids. Goku has finished healing and 
              then the Z-Team go to the Room of Spirit and Time to train (Every 
              minute in this world is 6 hours in there). Cell finds #17 and #16, 
              he fights #16 and rips him apart. Then absorbs #17 and reaches his 
              second form. Tienshinhan tries to stall Cell while #18 and #16 break 
              for it. #16 is fixed up and he is now on the good guy's team. In 
              the room of Spirit and time Gohan has reached Super Saiyajin. Trunks 
              and Vegeta are done training and they go off to fight Cell. Vegeta 
              is whacking him a lot, but then lets Cell absorb #18 to become super 
              perfect! Cell then beats down Vegeta, Trunks sees his father in 
              need of help, he is enraged! His muscles grow about 2 X and his 
              hair started standing up more on end. He reached Ultimate Super 
              Saiya-jin! He and Cell fought for a while and was doing pretty good. 
              Goku and Gohan where done in the room of spirit and time. They flew 
              to the battle ground, Trunks could<br>
              not fight any more. Goku then fought Cell, it was pretty even but 
              then Cell beat down on Goku. Cell then made a bunch of little Cells, 
              they where called Cell Jr.. Goku then had Gohan fight Cell. Gohan 
              could not touch cell, he was<br>
              getting whooped. Then #16 came up behind Cell and tried to self-destruct, 
              but Bulma took the bomb out of him! Cell shot a beam and that ripped 
              #16 into pieces, his head was strewn in a pile of junk. Then Cell 
              stepped on #16's head and squashed it....WRONG THING TO DO! Gohan 
              then was enraged, he was so angry...that he...he....EXPLODED WITH 
              ANGER! He was Super Saiyajin 2!!! He killed all of the Cell Jr. 
              and stole his senzu back from Cell (Cell took it away before). He 
              gave the z-team some senzu after being beaten by the Cell Jr.. Then 
              Gohan kicked Cells ass! Cell tried to shoot Gohan with his most 
              powerful Kamehameha, but Gohan shot back. That ripped Cell in half. 
              Goku yelled at Gohan to finish him, but Gohan wanted Cell to suffer. 
              But<br>
              since Cell took Piccolo's cells he could regenerate like Piccolo. 
              So he regenerated, but he was using so much power that all of a 
              sudden he vomited #18 out. Kuririn took #18 to the side. He was 
              just perfect Cell now (his 2nd form). He knew he couldn't beat Gohan 
              so he went to go self-destruct to blow the planet up. Then Goku 
              used instantaneous movement to bring him to Kaiosama's. Cell blew 
              up Kaiosama's planet along with Goku and Kaiosama. Back on earth 
              Gohan was in shock, his Father just died. Then out of nowhere a 
              shot of ki hit Trunks and almost killed him. It was Cell! He used 
              instantaneous movement to go back to earth and he was now stronger 
              than ever! Then Trunks died and Vegeta got really pissed and attacked 
              cell head on and got a great hit and kept hitting him with blasts 
              then when he stopped cell came out of the dust.He then shot a blast 
              at Vegeta, Gohan flew in the way of it. It broke Gohan's arm. Then 
              Cell started powering up a Super Kamehameha. Gohan was<br>
              about to give up but then Goku talked to him. He told Gohan to shoot 
              another Kamehameha and use full power. Gohan then shot back at Cell. 
              It was an even fight, the beams where going back and forth. Vegeta 
              came in and shot Cell's back throwing him off balance. Gohan then 
              used his full power, blasting Cell into Oblivion.</p>

            <p>Majin Vegeta Saga<br>
              (Coming Soon)</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Buu Saga<br>
              <br>
              After Majin Vegeta killed himself to try to destroy Buu, Buu<br>
              regenerated. Him and Babide started wrecking Havoc all over, Buu 
              would turn people to candy then eat them. Goku only had a little 
              more time on earth. When Goku cam to, he went to Kamisama's (Dende's) 
              palace. They where still<br>
              out cold. After being there for a while he went to fight Buu. He 
              fought Buu, showing his true power of a Super Saiyajin 3. Then Babide 
              started calling Buu names, Buu was sick and tired of Babide's crap 
              so he then blew Babide's head clean off his body. At that time Goku 
              had a plan (He was back at Kaisama's). He wanted to teach the kids 
              (Goten and Trunks) how to do the &quot;Fusion&quot;. He taught them 
              with Piccolo. They didn't have it down verve well, but Goku had 
              to leave now. He couldn't stay on earth any longer. Piccolo was 
              then training the kids on the &quot;Fusion&quot;. They learned it 
              pretty good, not they just had to do some training to built their 
              strength. They trained in the room of spirit &amp; time. They tried 
              the Fusion again and it was a success! When transformed they could 
              go Super Saiyajin 3! At this time Mr. Satan was trying to make it 
              look like he beat Buu. He went to Buu's house and gave Buu some 
              candy, then asked if Buu could lay on the floor while he took a 
              picture of them with his foot on Buu. He started feeling sorry for 
              Buu. He then stayed with Buu being his cook, friend and even bath 
              buddy! They became best friends. Then they found a little puppy, 
              Buu loved this puppy dearly. But one day while playing with it a 
              hunter shot the puppy. Buu was furious! He<br>
              ran over to the dog and healed it. He almost exploded with anger, 
              he had to keep it bottled up. Then later the hunter came back (After 
              his beating from Mr. Satan) and shot Mr. Satan! Buu couldn't take 
              it any more, steam was<br>
              coming out of his holes, he healed Mr. Satan, then told him to leave. 
              Mr. Satan took the dog and started running. Then Buu went out and 
              there was an explosion of rage, Out of that explosion spawned another 
              Buu! This one was a lot darker and a lot skinnier. That Buu then 
              turned the old Fat Buu into chocolate and absorbed his power! That 
              evil Buu started to transform into a more fit Buu! He then flew 
              off, he was looking for those 2 kids. He then made it to Kamisama's 
              and told Piccolo to take him to the kids, Piccolo wanted them to 
              rest more, they where not ready to fight Buu yet because they still 
              needed to train. Piccolo talked Buu into waiting for a bit. Like 
              an idiot Chi-Chi came over to Buu yelling at him for &quot;killing 
              Gohan&quot;. Buu then<br>
              said, &quot;Become an egg&quot; and then stepped on her. When this 
              happened Goten and Trunks just happened to be walking by to start 
              training some more. Goten almost lost it. They trained some more, 
              but Buu was getting annoyed waiting.<br>
              He then told Piccolo to take him to them right away. Piccolo then 
              took Buu the long way. After walking for about an hour they made 
              it to the room of spirit &amp; time. The fight began, Goten and 
              Trunks fused to become &quot;Gotenks&quot;.<br>
              Gotenks was fighting in non-super Saiyajin form. Then after he made 
              it look like he was getting beaten he transformed into SSJ1. The 
              fight was going on for a while, but then Gotenks used his Kamikaze 
              ghost attack. He blew Buu<br>
              into pieces, he was everywhere! Then Piccolo and Gotenks started 
              burning the remains of Buu. After they where done a pink mist started 
              forming above their heads, it was Buu regenerating! They fought 
              a little, then Gotenks<br>
              told Piccolo that he was running out of strength and there was nothing 
              more he could do (He wanted to &quot;WOW&quot; piccolo by turning 
              SSJ3 in the middle of the fight). Then Piccolo destroyed the gateway 
              back to earth. They where stuck in the room of spirit &amp; time. 
              Piccolo told Buu that is that Buu could never see candy again. Buu 
              then started screaming in anger. He screamed so loud that it ripped 
              a hole from the room of spirit &amp; time back to earth. He saw<br>
              the chance to escape, so he did, leaving Gotenks and Piccolo behind. 
              Piccolo told Gotenks that they had to try the same thing if they 
              wanted to get out. They screamed and screamed, but the hole never 
              opened. Back on earth Buu turned everyone at Kamisama's into chocolate 
              then ate them. Back in the room of spirit &amp; time Gotenks told 
              Piccolo that he still had one thing he could use. The Gotenks turned 
              SSJ3. They screamed again and this time a portal opened up. They 
              where back on earth. Gotenks fought Buu for a while, but then un-fused, 
              their time was up. This whole time that everyone thought Gohan was 
              dead, he really wasn't. He was brought to Planet Kaioshin along<br>
              with Kaioshin and Kibit, Goku was even there since the dead where 
              allowed to be on that plain. Gohan was getting a power up by an 
              old Kaioshin (Who happened to be a perverted Kaioshin). Gohan was 
              brought to earth and he<br>
              started fighting Buu. He was wining for a while, but then Goten 
              and Trunks fused again. Then Buu used some of his body that was 
              ripped off during the fight to absorb Piccolo and Gotenks! He was 
              A LOT stronger now. Back on<br>
              Kaioshin the old Kaioshin told Goku that he needed to help. Goku 
              asked how and the old Kaioshin told Goku that he would give Goku 
              his own life, then Goku would no longer be dead. He told Goku that 
              he should use the fusion,<br>
              but to use the Potara fusion. He went to show Goku how it works. 
              He told Kibit to give Kaioshin (The young one) his earring. He told 
              Kaioshin to put that earring on. As soon as he did their bodies 
              flew together into one. They fused! Then the old Kaioshin mentioned 
              that that fusion is permanent. Then he gave Goku his life and a 
              pair of Potara earrings. Goku teleported back to Earth. He saw Gohan 
              getting his ass whooped. He threw Gohan the earring, but it fell 
              in a crack in the ground. Goku recovered it but it was too late, 
              Buu had absorbed Gohan. At this time Vegeta was given permission 
              to leave hell to fight. He got to earth and put the earring on. 
              He and Goku fused into Vegetto. Vegetto kicked Buu's ass. Buu absorbed 
              Vegetto and Vegetto un-fused in Buu. Inside Buu Vegeta and Goku 
              fought Buu's body. Then they saw Gohan, Trunks,Goten, Piccolo and 
              Fat Buu. Then Vegeta and Goku got them all (Except for<br>
              fat Buu). Then Vegeta asked Buu what would happen if he pulled Fat 
              Buu out of his stomach. Buu started screaming, &quot;NO!! DON'T!!&quot;. 
              So Vegeta (seeing that Buu didn't want that) pulled Fat Buu out. 
              Then Buu's body became hot,<br>
              Vegeta and Goku escaped with Gohan, Goten, Trunks and Piccolo. Then 
              when they where out of his body they saw that Buu became smaller, 
              he almost looked like a kid. Then Buu built a HUGE deathball and 
              threw it at the earth. Goku saw Mr. Satan and Dende watching behind 
              some rocks. Goku saved them and Kaioshin teleported to earth and 
              too Goku, Vegeta, Mr. Satan (and his puppy), and Dende to Planet 
              Kaioshin. Goten, Trunks, piccolo and the whole planet where gone. 
              Buu was in space looking for Planet Kaioshin. When he found it Kaioshin 
              had taken Dende to Planet Namek to wish back, Earth and the people 
              who died. Goku and Buu where fighting, Vegeta was too weak to really 
              hurt Buu. He just watched. But then Fat Buu came in and started 
              fighting Majin Buu (The Chibi-Buu)! Then Goku started building a 
              Chaou Genkidama. He started collecting Ki from every person in the 
              universe. But the people of earth didn't believe him so they would 
              not raise their hands to lend Goku their ki. Vegeta tried to talk 
              to them, but they hated him. Then their hero, Mr. Satan told them 
              to so they did. Then Goku threw the Chaou Genkidama at Buu, killing 
              him for good. That's when Goku said that he wishes that Buu would 
              be reincarnated into someone with a pure heart so they could spar, 
              not try to kill each other. This is about the end of the series, 
              the last episodes where at a Tenkaichi Budoukai a few years in the 
              future. Goten was now a teen and so was Trunks. Gohan and his High 
              School love got married and had a baby girl named Pan. Then you 
              learn that Goku made a deal with Emma and had Buu Reincarnated to 
              a young boy named Uub (Uub is Buu backwards, hence Uub). Goku and 
              Uub flew off to train for 5 years, and that is the beginning of 
              Dragonball GT.</p>
