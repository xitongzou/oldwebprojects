<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 1: This is it Goku, We 
Need You to Defeat Cell</font></span></u><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
As the tournament started, Cell and Goku's adrenaline was rising. Goku had been 
so confident with something for a long time to this moment. As the fight 
started, Goku and Cell exchanged lots of punches and kicks. In an attempt to try 
and defeat Cell, Goku, while in the air, started up a Kamehameha. This 
Kamehameha grew to be more and more powerful, as everyone was thinking Goku was 
collecting too much of ki energy. In fact, Goku was going along as planned. But, 
Cell knew he wouldn't fire at the Earth, since the Kamehameha was so big, and 
Goku protected the Earth. However, Goku got to the second &quot;me&quot; and Cell started 
to get a little worried. Just as that was going to happen, Goku appeared in 
front of Cell and let loose the Kamehameha. Cell was still alive, but it's the 
most famous attack against Goku vs. Cell. After a little bit more of fighting, 
Goku finally said he had given up. Cell couldn't believe that this great 
fighter, just decided to give up, willingly. Goku said he had a secret weapon in 
store for him to fight. </font> </span></p>

<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 2: Gohan has to Defeat 
Cell </font> </span></u><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Now Since Gohan is a peace lover, he didn't fight Cell much. In fact, he almost 
willingly just said go ahead and beat me up. However, he still remains alive, 
knowing, that if Cell pushes him to far over the edge, he will go ballistic. 
Cell cannot wait, and wants this boy to give him a challenge. But, before Cell 
could do anything more, Android 16 jumps in, puts a death grip on Cell, and, 
tells him he is going to blow him up with the bomb inside of him. After learning 
that Dr. Briefs and Bulma removed it, Cell turned on him, and blew him into 
pieces. Gohan's anger is rising now. </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 3: Gohan Transforms to 
Kill Cell</font></span></u><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
He tries to push him over, by sending some Cell Jr.'s after his friends and dad. 
After 7 are created, they go for the kill. But, Android 16 is still alive, just 
his head is still functioning. Mr. Satan decides that he will throw the head to 
the young boy, since the android told him too. When Android 16's head was thrown 
over, he told Gohan to forget about hurting anyone. He told him, to forget his 
peaceful ways. To just, fight, don't be afraid. If you have enough power in you, 
you can win, and he knows he does. With that, Cell's foot crashes on Android 
16's head, silencing him. &quot;I'm glad I finally got rid of that garbage,&quot; Cell 
says. Now, Gohan cannot take it. Between the horror of the past, between the 
anguish of the present, and between the agonies that will come if he doesn't do 
something, he just is burning with rage. With a scream, he is pushed over, and 
achieves something no other Saiyan has achieved at that time yet. He reaches 
another level of super Saiyan. All Cell can do now, is stare. </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 4: The Strength of 
Gohan can Beat Cell </font> </span></u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Gohan, pardon me, kicks major booty in this act. All seems lost, until Gohan 
turns super Saiyan 2. With lighting bolts and yellow aurora all around Gohan, 
Cell can only just stare at what he had created. Cell just stands, and waits for 
Gohan to make his move. Gohan, however, doesn't go after him, but goes after the 
Cell Jr.'s. One by one, each one is either decapitated of blow up. Once done, 
Gohan goes for Cell. With a swift flick of the wrist, he grabs the senzu. Cell 
is truly amazed at what speed this boy has. Gohan flies over to Trunks and gives 
him the senzu bad, telling him to give each person one. Cell decides to attack, 
but his punches aren't connecting. Cell decides, he will blow up the Earth now. 
After going plenty into the air, Cell charges up a Kamehameha. After completing 
and firing, while Gohan starts his own. Just about one second away from Gohan's 
face, Gohan lets loose his Kamehameha. Gohan's Kamehameha is more special, than 
Cell's, for it is absorbing Cell's own Kamehameha. It over powers, and, Cell has 
only half of his body, when the smoke clears. Goku tells Gohan to finish him 
now, before it's too late. Gohan decides, he will have more fun. After getting 
all of his limbs back, Cell started to get enraged, and tries to copy what Gohan 
did, and tries to go super Saiyan 2. It doesn't work however, for he only 
achieves ultra super Saiyan. This slows down Cell so much Gohan doesn't even try 
anymore. In fact, when Cell is trying his hardest, Gohan just ever so quickly, 
punches Cell in guy, sending him back. Gohan decides, he needs one more for the 
road. He punches him again, and, Cell cannot believe how much pain he is 
experiencing. After a grotesque manner of vomiting, Android 18 is spit up. This 
causes Cell to go back down to his second form. Now, just about anyone that is 
standing watching, can defeat him. Cell has no choice, but, to blow the world 
up. He begins to grow big, very big. The bomb has less that one minute when he 
started. Gohan could not believe it. He had trained so hard, achieved a new 
level, and now, he postponed Cell's death, for his enjoyment. But now, the world 
will not be sparred this time. Or will it? </font> </span></p>

<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 5: Son Goku takes Cell 
to Blow Up, but will He Make It!? </font> </span></u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Goku decides, he has done enough to help, and will get rid of Cell once and for 
all. Goku tells his son to move out of the way, and, to take care of his wife. 
Gohan doesn't want his dad to go, and pleads him to stay. Goku says, this is the 
only thing to do. After giving a nod, Cell and Goku disappear. When they land, 
they give three people very big astonishment. Kaio Sama, Bubbles, and Gregory, 
are not too happy, because, in about 5 seconds, they were going to die. Goku 
tells them sorry, that, this was the only safest place he knew, that he could 
take Cell, with few casualties. Cell yells out that he is going to explode, and 
with that, he does. A bright white fills the air, for Cell, and Goku, are gone. 
When the smoke clears, only smoke remains, or is there more. </font> </span></p>

<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 6: He's Back from the 
Dead, Cell is Complete Again </font> </span></u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Everyone is in tears, for their beloved hero, is gone. But, everyone starts to 
sense an enormous power. Who could it be? The first one to know is Trunks, after 
being killed by a enormous ki blast. Being pushed several feet back, Trunks lies 
in a pool of blood, being tortured over the pain he is in. Cell shows himself, 
back to his perfect, and, letting everyone know his story, that he learned how 
to do the Shunkanidou/instantaneous movement/instant transmission and to go 
super Saiyan 2, causing Cell to be super complete. Vegeta, showing something he 
never shows, gets angry, over the loss of his son. He powers up to ultra super 
Saiyan, and begins the attack. After what seemed like an eternity, he is 
finished with this attack, and Cell is unscathed. Cell blasts Vegeta back. Gohan 
is enraged, that his dad died, and it still didn't work. Cell starts up another 
ki blast, to kill Vegeta. Just as it is about to hit Vegeta, Gohan jumps in, and 
sacrifices an arm. Cell tells him, he will not miss this chance, and, starts up 
another Kamehameha. Gohan starts his Kamehameha as well, and soon, a Kamehameha 
tug o war has started. Both powers are equal, and not much is happening. But, 
Piccolo, Krillin, Yamcha, and Tenshinhan want to help, and they do so, but it 
has no effect. When it seems like Cell is going to win, Gohan pushes back. When 
it seems like Gohan is going to win, Cell pushes back. It is a never-ending 
power struggle. </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 7: A Big Explosion!! 
Gohan Finally Kills Cell</font></span></u><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Vegeta, on top of a mountain, cannot believe, that a low class warrior, Goku, 
achieved super Saiyan. And now, the low class warrior's son, half a blood of a 
Saiyan, is stronger than him. He cannot and he will not allow it. He goes in, 
for one last blast. Just as Cell is about to push the Kamehameha to Gohan, 
Vegeta comes from behind, and, fires a large ki blast at Cell. Goku, coaching 
Gohan through the Kamehameha tug o war, tells him, this is his chance, and to 
give it all he has got. Gohan does so, and, over powers Cell. Cell gets one last 
glimpse at his opponent. A young boy, with only one arm, that even has cells in 
him, is going to kill him. All Cell can do now, is scream in pain. With that, 
the Kamehameha over powered him, and, Cell died, for good. Gohan went out of 
super Saiyan 2, and collapsed on the ground, happy as ever. </font> </span>
