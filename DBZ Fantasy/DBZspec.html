        Story<br>
        After destroying the entire Kannassajin race, Bardock (Goku's father) 
        and his men relax and discuss various topics. However, a last surviving 
        Kannassajin manages to attack Bardock by surprise, successfully landing 
        a blow on the back of Bardock's head. The blow has a strange result: it 
        bestows on Bardock the ability to see the future. Seeing his planet and 
        people killed by Furiza and believing his son will also later die, Bardock 
        takes it upon himself to attempt to gather the Saiyajins to kill the tyrant. 
        Receiving nothing but mock and disbelief, Bardock flies to space and faces 
        Furiza himself.<br>

        Thoughts<br>
        The story is much deeper and more emotional than that of any other Dragon 
        Ball movie, and truly is the one film that should be watched above all 
        others. Now with the DVD version released here in the U.S., all fans should 
        pick up a copy and watch a piece of Dragon Ball perfection.</p>

      <p>Story<br>
        With Goku dead from a viral heart disease, the Z Warriors are faced with 
        defeating Dr. Gero's androids on their own. The battles end with only 
        Gohan surviving and years of the Earth being ravaged and destroyed by 
        the androids since there is no one strong enough to defeat them. Angered 
        by the destruction-taking place, Trunks asks for Gohan to train him to 
        help with the android fight. During a battle with the androids, Gohan 
        and Trunks are both severely beaten, and Gohan gives Trunks the last senzu 
        to save the teenagers life. This leaves Gohan with only one arm. When 
        the androids attack the Western Capital, Gohan dies. When finding Gohan's 
        body, Trunks transforms. Years later, Bulma completes the time machine 
        that she wants Trunks to travel back in time in. But, Trunks wants to 
        take one more shot at the androids.<br>

        Thoughts<br>
        This movie is great and shows how the future was if Goku had died. The 
        music and story are amazing. Further, Trunks' first Super Saiyajin transformation 
        makes this movie another one that you shouldn't miss.</p>

      <p>Story<br>
        While gathering firewood, Goku and Gohan notice that the trees and forest 
        area around them are dying. Mr. Popo floats down to them and explains 
        that a gas called Destron is destroying all life on Earth (including human), 
        and will eradicate everything within 72 hours. They join up with Vegeta, 
        Piccolo, and Trunks, then set out to destroy the Destron-emitting machines. 
        Just when they believe all the machines have been destroyed, another is 
        found. This one has a protective shield that even Goku's ki attacks can't 
        penetrate. To save Earth, Goku, Gohan, Trunks, Vegeta, and Piccolo journey 
        to the Dark Planet to face Dr. Raichii.<br>
        <br>
        Thoughts<br>
        This film is enjoyable, even though the background music wasn't nearly 
        up to the norm of DBZ. I was very disappointed. The story itself was entertaining, 
        with unexpected surprises. But there were plot holes and if made just 
        a little longer, this problem could have been resolved</p>
