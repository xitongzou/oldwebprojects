<H3 align=center>Hell on Earth<BR>
By Benjamin Ure</H3>

<P>"Huh? Wha-" mumbled the sayjin as the radio from his scouter awakened him.  
<P>&lt;...Sir, we have encountered a strange force as we are coming onto the planet Earth. Please come to the main area of the ship...&gt; 
<P>"I'm on my way. Rieko, out." 
<P>As the captain walked out of his capsule, he couldn't help wondering just what he would say to Gokou when he got to Earth. 

<H3 align=center>Chapter One:
<BR>The Crash</H3>

<P>As the captain arrived at the meeting place, he saw a panic going on. An officer ran up to him. 
<P>"Captain!" the officer cried, "We are going to crash!"
<P>"WHAT?" yelled Rieko, "Why?!"
<P>"There is something pushing us toward Earth! It is attacking the back of the ship!" 
<P>"Damn..." Rieko mumbled to himself. 
<P>As the first rumble of force from the planet hit, the walls of the ship started to crumble. Rieko ran to the intercom of the ship. 
<P>&lt;All sayjin warriors, prepare for battle!&gt;
<P>As the warriors arrived the captain realized there was no use of attacking for they were too close to the planet. 
<P>"PREPARE FOR A CRASH!" 
<P>The explosion echoed across the night sky of the Earth.

<H3 align=center>Chapter Two:
<BR>Savior</H3>

<P>"Bulma! I've found somthing!" cried a faint voice. "Over here!"
<P>As Rieko opened his eyes, he looked strait into the face of a blonde haired girl. He stumbled up and tried to walk away but fell again. 
<P>"Stay back..," he sighed and everything went black.
<P>He woke up in a lab of some sorts. He saw two women and a sayjin boy. 
<P>"Where am I, and who are you?" he asked. 
<P>"You are on Earth. My name is Bulma. I nursed you back to health," the older woman explained. Bulma pointed to the blonde haired girl. "This is  Juuhachi-gou. She found you." 
<P>Rieko smirked and a questioning look appeared on the face of Juuhachi-gou. 
<P>"Another killing machine I see," said Rieko and Juuhachi-gou jumped. 
<P>"No...I..." 
<P>The android ran off into the back of the lab. 
<P>"Hey," yelled the boy, "she has been through a lot! She forgot who she was and now she is no longer evil. She helps us." 
<P>"Oh," said Rieko softly feeling a pang of guilt, "I had no idea..." 
<P>"By the way, I'm Trunks." explained the boy. 
<P>"Trunks?!" yelled Rieko. "Do you remember me from when you were a child?"
<P>"Huh?" asked the boy. "I knew you?"
<P>"Your mother may remember... I used to train with Vegeta at this very place," Rieko told him as he looked to Bulma. "My name is Rieko."
<P>Bulma's jaw dropped. "Rieko? I remember you! You helped me with some of my experiments while Vegeta was away. I didn't recognize you."
<P>Rieko smiled and stood up. He ran a hand through hair that looked somewhat like Gokou's. His smile was cut short as he remembered his mission. 
<P>"I have come here to warn you of a new threat. An enemy is approaching. He is much stronger than Perfect Cell. He is from an unknown race of killing pirates. These pirates roam the galaxies looking for places with many great fighters. They kill the people there and take the planet for their own doing, becoming dictators. Trunks, you, I, and the android must train to be ready for this deadly threat. Will you help me?" 

<H3 align=center>Chapter Three:
<BR>The Answer</H3>

<P>"No," said Trunks calmly, "I have to protect my mother."
<P>"Yes," sighed Rieko, "I had a feeling you would say that...Bulma where are the others?" 
<P>"The others?" Bulma asked.
<P>"You know... Vegeta, Piccolo, Gokou, Gohan."
<P>"Oh! They're at Kami's training."
<P>"Ok. Goodbye everyone. Hey Trunks."
<P>"Yes?" asked Trunks.   
<P>"Tell Juuhachi-gou... I'm sorry..."
<P>"Ok. Rieko?"
<P>"Yes?"
<P>"Good luck."
<P>Rieko smiled to the boy and his mother. 
<P>"Thank you for helping me..."
<P>Rieko powered up and flew off into the distance. 
<P>&lt;"Trunks, if you ever reconsider helping us, just ask..."&gt; 
<P>&lt;"Ok. Goodbye."&gt;
