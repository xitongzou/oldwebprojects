</h3>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Salt - “Zorudo”*</b> A short, red crony of
Garlic Junior.&nbsp; He wears Mongolian style clothing, and is a little shorter
than Gohan.&nbsp; Salt is fairly weak, and is one of the first to die in the
saga.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Sanshyo*</b> Garlic Junior’s muscle-bound
minion in DBZ Movie 1, “Return My Gohan!” or, as the dubbed version goes,
“Deadzone”.&nbsp; His battle cry is “Pepperoni!” in the dub, and he is
killed by Piccolo, who takes his revenge on Garlic Junior’s men for attacking
him in the wilderness at the opening scene of the movie.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Sauza*</b> The leader of Cooler’s Special
Forces team in DBZ Movie 5, “Battle of the Strongest”.&nbsp; He is knocked
out early on in the movie, but he manages to survive up until the end.&nbsp; He
is killed by Piccolo with a Makankosappo.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Seibamen - “Saibai Men”</b> (Cultivars)
Little green foot soldiers that the Saiyajin and/or Frieza’s men utilize
whenever they don’t want to get their hands dirty, so to speak.&nbsp; In the
manga, their name translates literally to cultivars.&nbsp; When warriors do not
consider their opponents worthy enough to fight them, they often use seibamen to
take them out instead.&nbsp; These creatures are more like biological weapons.&nbsp;
They are plant-like, and stored in seed-form in a small vial.&nbsp; When the
seeds are planted, and a special solution poured over the seeds, it takes only a
few seconds before they pop out of the ground as wild little green monsters.
Seibamen are brutal and random, but not very intelligent.&nbsp; They don’t
speak, only screech and utter their own throaty cries, yet they understand
speech, and are capable of following simple instruction.&nbsp; Each seibaman is
fairly strong, with a power level of 1,200 (about the same power level as
Radditz), but probably their best technique is their kamikaze explosion tactic.&nbsp;
Nappa and Vegeta use the seibamen, six in all, to fight Krillin, Gohan and the
crew first instead of fighting Earth’s forces themselves to show the
Earthlings how weak they are in comparison to their own Saiyajin power.&nbsp;
When one of the seibamen shows the slightest sign of weakness, Vegeta kills it
for its incompetence. Yamcha nearly kills one, but unfortunately fails to finish
it off.&nbsp; It grabs him from behind and uses its kamikaze attack to kill them
both.&nbsp; Piccolo and Krillin finish off the remaining seibamen.</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Senbe Norimaki</b>&nbsp; (Dr. Slump) A main
character of Toriyama’s manga “Dr Slump,” he lives in Penguin Village with
Arale-chan (Arale Norimaki).&nbsp; He is a self-proclaimed genius and created
Arale-chan (an android) and many wacky inventions such as a Time Stop watch and
several vehicles.&nbsp; He was born in 722 AD.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Shao</b> The dog-ninja crony of Emperor Pilaf.&nbsp;
He and Mai usually work together to carry out the work of their ambitious
Emperor, who is both short of stature and temper.&nbsp; Shao and Mai don’t
accomplish a whole lot whenever Goku and crew get involved, however.&nbsp; Shao
is not particularly smart, but his original dub voice sounds kind of cute.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Sharpener - “Shyapuna”</b> One of
Gohan’s classmates at Orange Star High School.&nbsp; He is a tall jock with
long blonde hair, and he participates in many sports and clubs.&nbsp; He tries
to torment Gohan for a while in school, but Gohan hardly notices.&nbsp; Later he
befriends Gohan when he realizes that Gohan is capable of catching baseballs 20
feet in the air and taking a fast-ball directly to the face without so much as
flinching.&nbsp; In the anime, Sharpener embarks on a “quest” to unmask the
Great Saiyaman during the 25th Tenkaichi Budoukai, and he tries all sorts of
wacky things to get the Great Saiyaman to take off his sunglasses.&nbsp; He
finally does get a picture of him without the sunglasses, though it was too
quick for him to see with his eyes.&nbsp; However, Piccolo sees this, and
deliberately raises his ki to bust all the cameras and video cameras in the
vicinity, including all news reporters’ cameras.</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Shen</b> The alias that Kami enters the 23rd
Tenkaichi Budoukai under.&nbsp; He possesses the body of a typical nerdy-looking
guy to disguise himself so that he can defeat Piccolo under the public eye.&nbsp;
His name is a pun on the first part of the Earth dragon’s name, Shenlong, and
it means “God” (the second part means “dragon”).&nbsp;</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Shenlong - “Shenrongu”</b> The dragon of
the Earth Dragonballs, created in the year 470 AD by Kami.&nbsp; The name
Shenlong literally means “dragon god”.&nbsp; This dragon appears when all
seven Dragonballs are gathered in one place and someone utters “Come out,
Shenlong!”. He has the power to grant one wish to any person that calls upon
him once he has arrived.&nbsp; However, he can never grant the same wish twice,
and he cannot grant a wish that goes beyond the power of his creator, Kami.&nbsp;
When the wish is made and after it is granted, Shenlong leaves once again, and
the Dragonballs scatter all across the Earth.&nbsp; The Dragonballs also turn to
stone, as they cannot be used for a year after a wish is granted.&nbsp; When the
year has passed, the Dragonballs become active again, ready to be gathered and
wished upon.&nbsp; When his creator dies, the dragon “dies” with him, and so
Shenlong and the Earth Dragonballs disappears for a while when Piccolo and Kami
die.&nbsp; However, when Dende is appointed the new Kami, he takes the place of
the old Kami and the Shenlong can live on, even if the old Kami (who had fused
with Piccolo) were to die.&nbsp; The Earth Dragon and Dragonballs return when
Piccolo is wished back (and Kami returns also).&nbsp; The Earth Dragonballs are
relatively small, each about the size of a large orange.&nbsp;</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Shin</b> -&nbsp;&nbsp; see East Kaioshin
Shougesh -&nbsp;&nbsp; see Panboukin&nbsp;</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>General Silver - “Shiruba Taisa”</b> The
very first member of the Red Ribbon Army who encounters and battles Goku. He is
strong by normal human standards, but Goku defeats him easily and knocks him
out.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Slug - “Suraga”*</b> An old Namekian, and
the only other Namek alive besides Piccolo/Kami that is not an offspring of
Guru.&nbsp; Also like Piccolo/Kami, he did not know of his Namekian origins,
although it is never made clear if he only forgot them somehow after the passage
of so much time, or he lost his memory, just as Piccolo/Kami had. He appears in
DBZ Movie 4 as the emperor of a frozen, sunless mobile planet.&nbsp; At the
beginning of the movie, Slug’s planet nearly collides with the Earth.&nbsp; In
order to save Earth, Goku and Kryllan fly out to the planet and destroy it.
However, Slug made it off the frozen planet in his ship, along with most of his
army, and he lands on Earth planning to take over the planet.&nbsp; He is not
weak, but he is very old, and when he hears of the dragonballs from Bulma, he
reads her mind for information about the dragonballs, and sends his men off to
search for them.&nbsp; An unknown length of time later, perhaps only days, they
manage to collect all of the dragonballs and bring them back to Slug, who wishes
to be young again.&nbsp; With that accomplished, his power has greatly
increased, and he continues his conquest of Earth.&nbsp; Piccolo and Goku do
most of the fighting in the movie, and manage to destroy most of his minions.&nbsp;
Slug powers up so high that he turns into a “Super Namek,” and uses an
ability that has only been seen once before, when Piccolo Daimaou increased his
size and strength by many times. It seems that he will defeat Goku, until
Piccolo remembers that Gohan’s whistling nearly incapacitated him at the
beginning of the movie.&nbsp; After ripping off his own ears, he screams at
Gohan to whistle that song, which the boy does, and throws Slug into a screaming
fit on the ground.&nbsp; Namek ears are so huge that their hearing is acute far
beyond even that of a Saiyajin.&nbsp; When Slug increases his size to that of a
giant, his ears grow several hundred times larger as well, making the whistling
hurt all the more.&nbsp; Goku finishes Slug with a Genki Dama.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Snow - “Suno”</b> A little girl about nine
years old who lives in Jingle Village.&nbsp; She rescues Goku from the freezing
cold weather, which he is unaccustomed to and poorly equipped for, when his
plane crashes in the cold northern region.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Soybean - “Daizu”*</b> The shorthaired,
necklace-wearing crony of Turles in DBZ Movie 3.&nbsp; He is killed by Goku.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Spopovitch - “Supopobitchi”</b> Spopovitch
was once a normal, though strong human who fought well in the previous Tenkaichi
Budoukai.&nbsp; Babidi took control of his mind during the Buu Saga, and he was
turned into an evil, maniacal powerhouse.&nbsp; With Yamuu as his assistant,
Spopovitch is sent by Babidi to collect energy for his master at the 25th
Tenkaichi Budoukai.&nbsp; He fights Videl in the first round, and he nearly
beats her to death before Gohan steps in.&nbsp; Yamuu and Spopovitch team up on
Gohan, who goes Super Saiyajin, and using a special device, they rob him of his
energy.&nbsp; After completely draining him, they return to their master Babidi
to deliver the energy to him.&nbsp; Babidi soon decides they have outlived their
usefulness and causes both Spopovitch and Yamuu to explode.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Supa Man</b> - An inhabitant of Penguin
Village.&nbsp; He is a short, pudgy Clark Kent look-alike who can change into
his alter ego “Supa Man” by running into a telephone booth and putting on a
classic Superman garb.&nbsp; The Japanese lettering on his chest is the kana “su”,
as opposed to an “S” on his shirt.&nbsp; He is really just an average human
with average strength, but he claims to have super powers which he gains by
eating pickled plums.&nbsp; While parked on the street he meets Blue Shogun, who
orders him to step out of his car and let him drive off in it.&nbsp; The man
refuses and promptly runs into a nearby telephone booth and changes into “Supa
Man”.&nbsp; He then steps out and declares that he will not give up his car to
any source of evil.&nbsp; Blue Shogun calmly goes to the telephone booth, picks
it up and crushes it in his hands.&nbsp; After that, “Supa Man” gladly gives
Blue his car and even gives him directions to the nearest airport.&nbsp; As Blue
drives away, “Supa Man” stands triumphant, declaring that he has made that
particular place of ground that he’s standing on a safer place.</font>
