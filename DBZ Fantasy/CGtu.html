<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>General Tao - “Tao Pai Pai”</b> Brother of
Crane Elder, he is a world-renowned assassin who works for the Red Ribbon Army.&nbsp;
His main job is to locate Dragonballs and take out Goku.&nbsp; Having never been
defeated, he at first assumes that stopping the antics of a small child is a
simple task, until he realizes that Goku is more than what he seems. At one
point, he throws a grenade at Goku and leaps high into the air, thinking he’s
won.&nbsp; But Goku instead uses his Power Pole like a baseball bat and smacks
it away.&nbsp; Unfortunately for Tao Pai Pai, the grenade goes flying into the
air right for him, and detonates in his face.&nbsp; Tao manages to survive, but
is forced to recreate some parts of his body as a cyborg.&nbsp; The next time
Tao Pai Pai appears is in the 23rd Tenkaichi Budoukai where he faces off with
Tien.&nbsp; As Tien was once Crane Elder’s student, Tao Pai Pai proclaims Tien
to be a traitor to his brother and himself.&nbsp; During the match, Tao pulls a
dagger from his robotic arm and slashes Tien across the chest, leaving a
permanent scar.&nbsp; Tien still defeats him, knocking him out with a swift
powerful punch.&nbsp; Tao Pai Pai returns again much later in the anime midway
through the Cell Saga and meets Goku’s son Gohan.&nbsp; His pink shirt with
the words “kill you” on the back is a nice touch to his wickedness.&nbsp; He
tries to trick Goku out of the Dragonballs he’s gathered, but fails despite
Goku’s total naiveté concerning Tao’s intent.&nbsp; Tao finally gives up
and lets him walk away without a fight, which Tao knows would be suicide.&nbsp;
Tao Pai Pai stands 5’8” tall and weighs 155 ½ lbs, and he of course
declines to disclose his home address at the Tenkaichi Budoukai, due to the fact
that he is a world famous assassin.</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Tien - “Tienshinhan” </b>One of the few
humans to ever master his ki and perhaps the strongest human ever to exist.&nbsp;
Tien is considered human despite the third eye in the middle of his forehead,
which never blinks, but usually looks in the same direction that his two normal
eyes are looking.&nbsp; Tienshinhan trained under Crane Elder when he was young.&nbsp;
Dedicated and strong-willed, he was the perfect student, and thus he learned
quickly from his master.&nbsp; Tien trained hard until he became an incredibly
powerful warrior not to be reckoned with by any on Earth.&nbsp; His past is
never fully revealed, but through the course of several adventures he becomes
best friends with Chaozu the young emperor, and gives up his dedication to his
master as an assassin when he discovers a plot against the emperor.&nbsp; He
faces off against Goku in the finals of the 22nd Tenkaichi Budoukai, and it
seems that he is about to win until Piccolo Daimaou’s spawn Tambourine enters
the scene and disrupts the match.&nbsp; The match is never finished, and so the
winner of the 22nd Tenkaichi Budoukai is never determined, except to a draw
between Goku and Tien. Tien stays loyally by the side of Chaozu, his travel
companion and sparring partner, and his closest friend.&nbsp; He has many moves
that the others picked up from him and used in battle.&nbsp; Some examples of
these are Taiyoken (Solar Flare) and the Tri-Form technique.&nbsp; However,
unlike the others, Tien masters the Tri-Form technique and expands on it until
he creates multiple forms of himself, sometimes 4 or more.&nbsp;&nbsp; He also
masters a move called the Kikoho, or the Triangle beam, the same used to stall
Imperfect Cell, an act that nearly kills Tien.&nbsp; He weighs 166 lbs. and is
6’1” tall, making him the second tallest member of the Z crew.</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>“Toma”*</b> A tall, muscular member of
Bardock’s crew in the Bardock Special, he is second in command of the team and
Bardock’s best friend.&nbsp; He is the last of Bardock’s team to die, except
for Bardock himself.&nbsp; When Bardock travels to planet Meet, he finds his
entire crew slaughtered.&nbsp; The only one left alive is Toma, who is fatally
wounded.&nbsp; Toma tells Bardock how Frieza’s Elite Forces and Dodoria killed
them because Frieza feared the Saiyajin were becoming too strong, especially
Bardock’s team.&nbsp; The red band that Bardock wears is actually the same
white band that Toma has wrapped about his arm, soaked with Toma’s own blood
that Bardock wipes from his friend’s face as Toma makes his last request –
to stop Frieza.</font>
</p>
		  
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Torah -&nbsp;&nbsp; see Toma</font></b>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Totepo*</b> The big, burly member of
Bardock’s team in the Bardock Special.&nbsp; He is another one of the strong,
silent type.&nbsp; In fact, he never speaks a word in the entire movie!&nbsp;
However, in the dubbed version, FUNi gives him one or two phrases for some odd
reason.</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Chibi Trunks - “Chibi Torankusu”&nbsp;
(Young Trunks)</b> Son of Vegeta and Bulma, Trunks is only an infant when he
first appears in DBZ during the Android Saga.&nbsp; He has purple hair like his
grandfather Dr. Briefs, but his facial features, stance and strong Saiyajin
pride clearly show that he is a descendant of the Saiyajin royal line.&nbsp; He
has a sister named Bra who is about 12 years younger than he.&nbsp; His role
becomes much larger by the Buu Saga, at which point Trunks is 8 years old and
fantastically strong for his age.&nbsp; He goes Super Saiyajin while training
with Vegeta in the gravity room, an event that comes as a shock to all
considering his young age.&nbsp; Filled with pride, Chibi Trunks is adventurous
and constantly looks for stronger opponents to challenge, much like his father.&nbsp;
During the final episodes of DBZ, Trunks, who is now 18, appears to be
developing the same personality as Future Trunks.&nbsp; This can be seen in
adult Trunks throughout GT as well.&nbsp; Trunks is born in the year 766 AD, and
is 29 years old by the end of GT.</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Future Trunks - “Torankusu no Mirai”&nbsp;
(Mirai Trunks) </b>Son of Vegeta and Bulma, he is a purple-haired, blue-eyed
teenage sex symbol, and probably the biggest heartthrob for the lady fans of DBZ,
which is what his character was meant for (especially considering he’s the
most powerful, and considered by many the sexiest unmarried male character in
DBZ).&nbsp; He also carries a sword, which seems unnecessary considering the
circumstances of ki in DBZ.&nbsp; It is popularly believed that Trunks was drawn
with the sword mostly for the looks, because of a possible assumption of
Toriyama that guys are into weapons and girls would think it sexy.&nbsp; Trunks
is about 18 years old when he first appears in DBZ.&nbsp; He arrives just in
time to kill Frieza and King Cold, and to warn the Z fighters of the android
attack that will occur 3 years in their future.&nbsp; He is from an alternate
future in which Goku dies of a viral heart disease not long after defeating
Frieza and King Cold.&nbsp; With Goku gone, there is no Super Saiyajin to stop
the evil androids of Dr. Gero from wreaking havoc across the Earth.&nbsp; The
two androids defeat and destroy every last Z fighter but Gohan, who loses an arm
in the onslaught.&nbsp; Born in the year 766 AD, Trunks was only an infant when
the androids attacked and killed the crew, leaving him fatherless.&nbsp; Gohan
trains Trunks in martial arts as he grows older, while in the meantime the
androids continue to destroy cities without mercy and kill crowds of people for
fun.&nbsp; When Trunks is about 10 or 11, Gohan is killed in a battle with the
androids.&nbsp; In the anime (and the movie), it is this event that triggers the
great emotion within Trunks to be released, causing him to turn into a Super
Saiyajin.&nbsp; In the manga, he already has the ability to turn Super Saiyajin
by the time Gohan dies.&nbsp; With a few years of work, his mother Bulma invents
a time machine that allows Trunks to travel back through time to the year 764
AD, two years before he is born, and give Goku the heart medicine to cure his
disease. Because the cure was not discovered until several years after Goku’s
death, this step is imperative to Goku’s survival.&nbsp; With this
accomplished, Trunks returns to his own time.&nbsp; Normally this would create a
paradox, with the argument that because of his actions, his present time no
longer exists.&nbsp; This is not true in this case, however, because by
traveling back in time, Trunks creates two separate dimensions altogether, so
that no matter how many changes he makes in the previous dimension, his will
remain the same.&nbsp; Trunks returns to his own time and waits 6 months for the
time machine to recharge.&nbsp; It is assumed that he trains during this period,
although it is never directly stated.&nbsp; Trunks returns to the past in 767
AD, only to find that the new dimension is already much changed from his own.&nbsp;
He stays to fight and help the crew to overcome the androids.&nbsp; He also
stays in order to learn more about the father he never knew.&nbsp; He trains
with Vegeta in the Room of Spirit and Time for the equivalent of a year, where
both reach Ultimate Super Saiyajin.&nbsp; He is killed by Cell near the end of
the Saga, but brought back with a wish using the Dragonballs.&nbsp; After Cell
is defeated, he waits a few days to give his final goodbyes to his young mother
Bulma and his father Vegeta, who finally admits his acceptance of him as a
worthy son.&nbsp; Trunks returns to his dimension once more, this time much
stronger than before, and with his great new power destroys the androids and
Cell from his own time period easily.&nbsp; He wields a powerful sword of
unknown origin (although the writers of Movie 13 attempt to explain it using
Tapion’s sword as a gift, which makes little sense considering there were no Z
fighters left in Future Trunk’s dimension to defeat Hildegarn except Gohan).&nbsp;
He uses his sword to slice Frieza to pieces in the Trunks Saga, but upon his
arrival 3 years later, he hardly ever draws it.&nbsp; Upon chipping it in a
battle with Android 18, Trunks learns that the sword will no longer do him any
good in battle.&nbsp; After this incident, Trunks does not try to fight with his
sword again until he returns home, when he battles the Cell of his dimension.</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Turles - “Taresu”*</b> The main villain of
DBZ Movie 3, “The Ultimate Decisive Battle for Earth” (“The Tree of
Might” in dub).&nbsp; He is a pure-blooded Saiyajin, a survivor of the
destruction of planet Vegeta.&nbsp; He looks very similar to Goku, but despite
the popular belief that they are brothers, distant cousins or even clones, the
two are in no way related whatsoever.&nbsp; The similarities in their features
are most likely due to lack of creativity by the anime artists during the making
of the movie.&nbsp; Turles has darker skin tones than most Saiyajin, and wears
dark purple armor.&nbsp; With a small group of followers, he travels the
universe searching for a planet with enough resources to plant a legendary magic
seed of the Shinseju Tree.&nbsp; According to legend, the tree absorbs all the
planet’s resources to grow, and once the tree grows to its fullest, it bears
fruit of the Gods, which contain all the energy retrieved from the planet’s
resources.&nbsp; If the fruit is eaten, that person will gain all the energy
stored in the fruit.&nbsp; With a great lust for power, Turles lands on Earth
and plants his seed.&nbsp; In a matter of hours the tree grows for several miles
around until it reaches hundreds of miles across the Earth, destroying all
cities and signs of life in its path.&nbsp; Goku and his friends fly to the
scene and battle his crew, only to find that they are overpowered except for
Goku.&nbsp; Turles does not participate in battle but instead kidnaps Gohan and
takes off for the trunk of the massive tree.&nbsp; Once he realizes that Gohan
is part Saiyajin, he gleefully turns the boy’s eyes up to the full moon (while
he takes care to look away), at which point Gohan transforms into Oozaru and
wreaks havoc.&nbsp; Piccolo challenges Turles, but the Saiyajin is far stronger,
and simply knocks him away.&nbsp; Although he has to work a little harder,
Turles defeats even Goku with ease.&nbsp; Once the tree grows to it’s fullest,
and bears fruit, Turles snatches up the fruit and consumes not one, but several
pieces.&nbsp; Turles returns to finish Goku, and they face off within the trunk
of the colossal tree.&nbsp; Goku fires a Genki Dama, or Spirit Bomb (which was
created from the energy stored in the fruit), at Turles and the tree, destroying
both with the enormous ball of Earth’s energy.</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Upa</b> The son of Bora, the Indian chief, he
helps his father guard the base of Kami’s Tower.&nbsp; When his father is
tragically killed, Upa accompanies Goku for a while and helps him recover all of
the dragonballs so that they can wish his father back to life.</font>
