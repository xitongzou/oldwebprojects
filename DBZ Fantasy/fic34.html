<H3 align=center>Vegeta vs Megaman X and Zero</H3>

<P>One day, Vegeta's flying and sees this funny-looking city. "Ooh! A city! Looks like TARGET PRACTICE time!" Vegeta thinks. He lands and starts thrashing the place. All seems cool for Vegeta when two streaks, one blue and one red, fall from the sky. They land and assemble to what seems like two robots. The blue one says, "What the hell are you doing you spiky-haired freak!" The red one says,"We're on a mission, and you can't interrupt, dammit!" "Oh, sorry to crash the party." Vegeta says in a sarcastic tone. "By the way, my name is Vegeta. What's yours, losers." "Don't call us losers! Anyway, mine is Megaman X." replies the one in blue. "Call me Zero." says the red-clad robot. "Such a true name, Zero!" retorts Vegeta. "No one makes fun of my name!" shouts Zero as he pulls out his Z-Saber and attempts to cut Vegeta to ribbons. Vegeta is apparently too swift for Zero's futile attack. As a counter-atttack, he deploys a destructo-disc and slices Zero's hand off. "You mess with Zero, you mess with me!" cries out X as he uses his Nova Strike Beam technique (as seen in Megaman X 4). Vegeta easily cancels the beam with a Kamehameha he learned from Goku (or Kakarott if you prefer). "Now it's my turn, kiddies!" says Vegeta with his trademark demented left lip rise grin as he charges up. The two robots then fuse to create Megaman Z. Vegeta is diverted from charging up due to this occurance. "What the hell...!? Those metallic rodents can fuse!? No matter! Now I only have one to work on! Thanks, y'all!" Vegeta says. MZ (Megaman Z), using a combinaton of Raijengeki (as seen in MMX4) and Nova Strike Beam, launches a Crush Shock Ray (I created this one). Even though diverted from charging up, Vegeta still gathered enough energy for a Gallet Gun. He fires it and destroys the Crush Shock Ray, Megaman Z, and just about the whole city. 

<BR><EM>Winner:</EM> (As always) Vegeta

<H3 align=center>Vegeta vs....His drinking problem!!!</H3>

<P>Few people know this, but Vegeta had a bad drinking problem. He started drinking when he was first defeated by Goku. Over the years, it became worse and worse. He felt he couldn't go a day without drinking. He was prone to drunken rages, Bulma and Trunks began to repeatedly "fall down the stairs". One day, as he was flying home after doing some heavy drinking, his vision became blurry. He rubbed his eyes, but he couldn't see straight anymore. He tried to stop, but he found he couldn't control his powers. They found his body three days later, imbedded in a mountain where he had crashed.

<H3 align=center>Vegeta vs.....Steve Case!!!</H3>

<P>One day Vegeta saw Trunks on the Computer. Vegeta says, "What the hell are you doing," Trunks answers him, "I'm on AOL." So Vegeta gets on and by mistake goes in a chat room. People are picking at Trunks because of his name(Screen Name: Tunks2245) Vegeta start cussing on the Computer calling everyone bitches and hoes. Then he starts to just get out of and with the cussing and just goes off. Then all Vegeta hears is Good-bye and AOL cuts him off for cussing in the chat room. Vegeta in a bit of rage just yells out "What the Fuck?!" Then Trunks explains to him that you cant cuss in the chat room. So Vegeta start to go crazy and asks "Who is the fucken creator of America Online." Trunks thinking what the hell is wrong with my dad says "Steve Case." So Vegeta goes out on a Rampage trying to find out who is Steve Case.(Kinda weird that he got pissed off cause of something like that.) So he finally finds the AOL C/O headquarters and finds Steve Case and jacks him up. What the hell is your problem not letting people cuss online. Well, Steve Case answers that "We have to make AOL suitable for all ages." So then a pissed off Vegeta slaps Steve Case. Steve case then busts out in a bit of rage and slaps Vegeta back then hits him with a Ki blast. "What the fuck you have powers" "Of course you fucken vegetable head freak who doesn't." Vegeta responds "Your gonna pay for touching me and talking about my head. ::cackles heavily and raises the left part of his top lip.:: Steve case says, "Well well just see about that." Vegeta powers up to SSJ and Steve Case doesn't know what to do so he attacks Vegeta knocking the hell out of him. Vegeta comes back with some hits of his own and knocks Steve Case out Steve gets up and Powers up and attacks Vegeta there is nothing Vegeta can do but let Steve do what he has to do. Steve is Powering up even while he's fighting how is he doing this Vegeta wonders. Then as Steve lays the smack down somemore on Vegeta. Then Vegeta notices that he can attack Steve when he punches cause Steve closes his eyes when he punches cause he is a little biotch. When Vegeta got his next opening Steve was through. "Your going to the NEXT DIMENSION BITCH." Yells Vegeta. "Your ass is mine you son of a bitch."(Notice how Vegeta loves to cuss.) Steve yells "Fuck you." and with his final energy powers up and blasts the shit out of Vegeta. "You stinken bitch what the fuck is wrong with you." Thinking you can fuck with the creater of AOL like that. Then Steve thinking he has won turns and walks away. All of a sudden there's a big bang. Then Vegeta pops-up and goes to work on Steve. All the time he was whoopin' Steve's ass he was singing this, "I been workin on the little bitch all the live long day!!!" and so on. "So now look at you Steve your own the floor like a little bitch." Then Steve says, "Fuck you bitch thats why I'll never change it." Thats pissed Vegeta off then he sent Steve not to the Next Dimension but two Dimensions over. So Vegeta finds Steve will and changes it and he put down that Steve left AOL to him. With that it now became VOL the online experience with the most cussing you ever heard.

<H3 align=center>Vegeta vs.....Mr. Satan!!!</H3>

<P>Vegeta was training in his gravity room when all of a sudden who should walk in but Mr. Satan. "I am Mr. Satan and when I'm though with you there won't even be a greasy stain left." In the middle of a complex fighting stance lifted an eyebrow (He hadn't turned his head toward Mr. Satan yet.) and then exploded with laughter. He checked in his scouter and thought to himself:"He doesn't even register! How pathetic!" and Mr. Satan said "I know I don't register!" Vegeta dropped his jaw because he didn't know that he could read minds. Mr. Satan then said, to Vegeta's amazement,"Garlic Ho!" Vegeta came to his senses just in time to dodge the attack and to his amazement yet again the beam shattered into a million pieces and was re-absorbed by Mr. Satan. This time Vegeta waisted no time in doing his trademark machine gun move, the Renzukou Energy Dan. Each of his ki blasts Mr. Satan easily countered with one of his own. Vegeta charged up to Super Saiya-jin and started beating the sense out of Mr. Satan. Half an hour later Mr. Satan was standing there without a scratch and Vegeta was lying in a pool of sweat. "Give up?" Mr. Satan said blankly. "I haven't even started to start my pre-warmups yet." Vegeta retorted. In his mind Vegeta knew if Mr. Satan didn't die or beg for mercy in the next ten seconds that he was in big trouble. He had already used nearly all his energy and couldn't even maintain Super Saiya-jin 2 state. So he charged up to Ultimate Saiya-jin, that undefined state beyond Super Saiya-jin 1 but not quite Super Saiya-jin 2. He had already tossed Mr. Satan around like a ragdoll... and so he thought of an alternative plan and charged down. "Oh, you finally gave up, good." Then Vegeta yelled "Ha! I already won! You see, I know that there is NO way that a loser like you could defeat me so this must be a dream..." Mr. Satan laughed yet said nothing. " and furthermore," Vegeta continued " I control my mind, so you're history." Vegeta then stuck up the finger at him and yelled "Super Really Big Energy Blast That Is Really Gonna Hurt Figments Of My Imagination Who Think They Can Beat The Mighty Vegeta Attack!" Then a single thin ray which hardly seemed worthy of it's excruciatingly long name blasted from the still extended finger and destroyed Mr. Satan. He then went on to become The Supreme Universal Deity and all the universe bowed to him... even Goku. And then he woke up.

"Hmmm... that must have been Mr. T... no one else has a van that helluva-fast." So instead of chasing Mr. T down, Vegeta made Mr. T come to him by blowing up a nearby dairy. "Where the kids gonna get their milk now, foo?" Mr. T said as he approached Vegeta, who stood in the ruins of the dairy. "You hit me with your van... now you die."
