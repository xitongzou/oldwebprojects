<h3><font face="Arial" color="#2F69A8">Dragonball Z Movie 8: Valiant Fight!
 Violent Fight! Super Exciting Fight!</font></h3>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Summary:<br>
 </b>A powerful force, that of a saiya-jin, has just destroyed the South Galaxy,
 and North Kaio, fears that our galaxy will be the next to go.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Spring has begun, and while the others go off
 and have fun, taking in a traditional view of the cherry blossoms, Goku is held
 in Chi Chi's grasp. She drags him along to a parent interview, which will test
 their worth, and be a deciding factor whether Gohan is accepted to the school.
 Goku is, as expected uncomfortable. Chi Chi insists he be proper, having him
 wear a business suit, and lie about his hobbies (he wants to say fighting tough
 opponents, but she tells him to say reading and sports!).</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">While the two are partaking in their little
 lying contest, their friends are enjoying the peaceful serenity of the
 blossoms. Kuririn is screeching out some karaoke, which is driving Vegeta a tad
 bit insane, when a large circular spaceship descends from above. It belongs to
 Paragas, yet another Saiaya-jin left after the destruction of planet Vegeta,
 along with his own army. Paragas persuades Vegeta, as the last of the saiya-jin
 royalty, to come with him to his new planet Vegeta, and help rebuild the fallen
 saiya-jin Empire. Vegeta decides against it, but Paragas speaks up about the
 Legendary Super Saiya-jin. He tells Vegeta that he is the only one who has the
 power to defeat such a warrior... one who has already destroyed the South
 Galaxy... To this Vegeta agrees, and boards the ship, along with Roshi, Trunks,
 Oolong, Gohan, and Kuririn.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Somewhere between all of this, Kaio has
 contacted Goku telepathically. He tells him of the Saiya-jin power he felt in
 the South Galaxy, and that he'll be in the North Galaxy soon. Goku then
 teleports to Kaio's small planet, attempts to detect the ki of the warrior,
 teleports that the suspected location, only to find him gone. An incredible ki
 is still present, though. This</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The others have since arrived at the new Planet
 Vegeta. Upon reaching a group of people celebrating Vegeta's return, Paragas
 introduces him to his son, Brolly, a slim, tall, and quiet young man. A soldier
 informs Vegeta that the legendary Saiya-jin showed up on planet Tonosama. This
 surprises Vegeta, and he quickly enlists Brolly to help him take care of him.
 Trunks asks his father to first gather more information on this dangerous
 situation, but Vegeta refuses, and makes his way to the site.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Trunks, Gohan, and Kuririn follow along, and
 Kuririn begins to doubt the existence of such a warrior. Trunks agrees, but he
 reassures that his father believes it fully. They discover that the planet is
 mostly in ruin, with little or no life left on its surface. Gohan can't quite
 understand why Paragas would want to rebuild the Saiya-jin race on such an
 inadequate planet. Suddenly, Kuririn sees a giant dome shaped light of some
 kind over the horizon. The group finds that it's actually energy being pumped
 from the core of the planet and sent to the palace, so it can support life.
 This task is being performed by a race of aliens, taken from their own home
 after the Saiya-jin destroyed their own home. They're being treated as slaves,
 malnourished and overworked, and they see the Saiya-jin as the demons of the
 universe. A soldier jumps down and sees the small child who had divulged this
 information to our heroes, and begins to hit him with a whip for slacking off.
 Gohan acts quickly and busts the soldier in the face, smashing right through
 his helmet he whistles for help, which comes and encircles Gohan. Kuririn just
 kind of laughs and tells the squadron not to be messing with them, because of
 their strength. The goons quickly back off. Kuririn's ego gets bigger, and he
 starts punching and kicking at the air, just as Goku materializes in front of
 his fist. He catches a hard right the jaw, which knocks him down. Kuririn asks
 him what he's doing here, and he tells them that he was simply following the ki
 of the legendary Saiya-jin. Kuririn tells Goku about the whole Vegeta thing,
 and suddenly Paragas appears, welcoming 'Kakaroto' to the planet. He knows that
 he is Bardock's son, and asks him to stay awhile and have a meal. Goku comes to
 the conclusion that the ki he felt was certainly not that of Paragas's, and has
 his dinner. The aliens are having a meal of their own, along with Trunks,
 Kuririn, and Gohan. They ask if it was Paragas that attacked their planet, but
 are met with a resounding 'no'. Trunks sensed very little power from Brolly, so
 he decides that the legendary Saiya-jin must be far off somewhere... Paragas is
 in an observatory, high above his city, strangely asking that a comet known as
 Kumorie come destroy his planet. Vegeta and Brolly return unsuccessfully from
 their trip, and are met by Goku who is hanging around the castle. Vegeta tell
 Goku not to interfere with his plans to kill the legendary super Saiya-jin and
 walks off. Brolly then stares at Goku with bitter rage, clenching his fist, and
 creating a huge aura of energy around the two. Paragas sees this and attempts
 to calm Brolly using some strange contraption on his hand. Roshi and Oolong
 round the corner, and ask Paragas to prepare a ship for their departure, as
 they've seen enough of the planet. Brolly then calms down, and his aura fades.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Later that night, Paragas is having his hand
 device checked by a scientist. He says it isn't broken, and perhaps Brolly is
 just becoming too much for it to control. Paragas walks out of the lab, and
 worries that Goku is the cause of him being unable to control Brolly with his
 instrument. He has flashbacks dating back to when Brolly was an adolescent, a
 super Saiya-jin who was quickly destroying a city with ki blasts. He talks
 about how Brolly is a true breed of Saiya-jin. He was born with incredible
 power and as he grew up, it became so violent and threatening that it scared
 him. He had a scientist to create tool that would work in conjunction with a
 remote device to control Brolly's power. It consisted of a golden headband, and
 a matching gauntlet remote, which in turn gave him the power to rule the
 universe with Brolly under his command. He figures that if the tool is still
 working, then it means that his meeting with Goku made him unable to be
 harnessed. Paragas then remembers that Goku and Brolly were born on the same
 day...</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Cut to the hospital, where baby Brolly and Goku
 are lying in their cribs. Goku is bawling his eyes out. Two doctors are
 discussing how incredible it is that Brolly was born with a fighting power of
 10,000, while Bardock's son, Kakaroto was only born with a meager level of 2.
 Kakarot's crying was making Brolly cry as well, so one of the doctors suggests
 that though his combat level is low, his fighting spirit is incredibly high.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Paragas looks in on Brolly sitting in a chair,
 filled with rage and shaking like a madman. Paragas damns Goku, and realizes
 that if he can't control Brolly, the universe will be destroyed. Brolly raises
 his energy and screams out &quot;Kakaroto!!!&quot;</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">All of our heroes are in bed, asleep, when
 Brolly bursts in and tears up the place, looking to kill Goku. He gets him
 outside, and over a lake, just as Paragas hears the commotion and grabs his
 wrist remote. Goku finds it interesting that Brolly can hide his power like the
 Z fighters. Brolly rushes at Goku and gets kicked in the face, leaving a trail
 of blood running from his mouth. Brolly licks it up, and smiles (ew!). Goku's
 attacks are beginning to have no effect on him, and eventually Brolly begins to
 power up further, beefing up his muscles, and leading Goku to sense the same ki
 he had felt earlier. Paragas arrives, and attempts to calm him down Brolly. It
 works, and the father and son duo fly home. Goku has found the identity of the
 legendary super Saiya-jin. We then see a brief shot of the dreaded comet coming
 closer to the planet...</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Morning. Vegeta and Brolly are making their way
 to the spaceship, much to the dismay of Paragas. He wants to keep Vegeta on the
 planet until the comet hits. Brolly begins to go insane again, as he hears
 Goku's voice coming from within the spaceship. He tells Vegeta that he doesn't
 need to go anywhere to find the legendary super Saiya-jin, since he's with them
 now. Goku instructs Paragas to confess to Vegeta about Brolly's status as the
 legendary super Saiya-jin. Paragas denies this fact, and asks Vegeta to return
 to the palace. Trunks then shows up, loudly declaring that Paragas is lying
 about everything. He informs them of the alien race he has enslaved to make the
 planet what it has become. While they ascend the hill towards the fighters, one
 of the alien children sees Brolly and announces him as the one who attacked
 their home planet. Vegeta is outraged at this trickery, and Paragas finally
 confesses. His true location to rebuild the Saiya-jin Empire was on Earth where
 resources are abundant, but he feared Vegeta would be in his way. That's why he
 designed a mock kingdom on a planet, with a comet fixed impact. By luring
 Vegeta there, and escaping the planet just before collision, Paragas would have
 no competition in the universe, and would be free to rule it with Brolly.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Brolly's anger consumes him, so he goes SSJ and
 walks slowly towards Goku. Vegeta immediately transforms as well, and tries to
 defeat Brolly with absolutely no success. Brolly's rage envelops him to such an
 extent that he is finally able to transform into a true super Saiya-jin and his
 golden headband shatters. His insane mind is now free. Vegeta is completely
 astonished at this occurrence, and he is reduced to a statuesque state of
 frightful awe. Gohan jumps in and tries to help his dad in the fight, but is
 quickly injured by simply coming into contact with the legendary warrior. As
 Trunks swoops in to help, Vegeta admits to himself that there will be no escape
 from this monster... Brolly will kill them all.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Paragas begins to speak indirectly to Vegeta. He
 regrets that his plan has failed him. He recollects on his hate for Vegeta's
 father, who saw Brolly's great power for what it actually was... a great
 threat. He wanted the baby killed off, and when Paragas Tried to persuade him
 against it, he was killed and thrown off into the dumps along with his son, who
 had been stabbed to death. But... they didn't die. Just as Freeza sent his
 death ball to destroy the original planet Vegeta, Brolly's latent power sprung
 to life and resurrected the both of them, and transported them into space, in a
 strange ball of energy. Since then, Paragas only lived for revenge, if not on
 King Vegeta, then on his son.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So begins the fight. One by one, all of the
 fighters, sans Vegeta raise their levels to that of super Saiya-jin. Still,
 they're not having much luck. Brolly's size doesn't decrease his speed in the
 slightest, and his brute strength is overwhelming. Kuririn, Oolong, Roshi, and
 the alien slaves show up, and are attempting to escape the doomed planet.
 Brolly notices the aliens, and reminds them of the times they looked up at
 their home planet and wondered when they could return. He fires a blast at the
 aliens, but it ricochets off of the ground, and flies backwards. He wasn't
 aiming for them at all! It soars higher and higher, then collides with their
 planet, completely obliterating it. The monster simply laughs at this event,
 and the slaves are forced to move along off of the battlefield with Kuririn and
 the others.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The battle rages. It's devastatingly one-sided.
 Trunks keeps getting rammed violently in to walls and such, Gohan gets knocked
 out and hung on a rod, and Goku generally can't do much damage do the big lug.
 Though he does get off a great line. After pummeling Goku with ki blasts, only
 to have Goku to walk out still standing, Brolly asks &quot;don't you ever give
 up?&quot; To which Goku responds, &quot;Heh, I never learned how.&quot;</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Brolly discovers that his ki is growing in
 strength. He's having real trouble controlling his own actions anymore, and
 what was left of his mind seems to be deteriorating quickly. He uncontrollably
 sends a flurry of ki blasts in all directions destroying much of the planet. He
 finally regains control of himself and senses something from Gohan. He throws a
 ball of energy at him, which is deflected by the one and only, Piccolo! Brolly
 decides that he's just another bug waiting to be squashed. Piccolo calls him a
 monster and tells him to do his best, but Brolly doesn't like to refer to
 himself as a monster, &quot;monster? No, I'm the devil.&quot;</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Piccolo gives each of the fallen heroes a senzu,
 and explains to Goku that the reason he knew their location was because he
 heard Kaio and Goku conversing earlier. He came as fast as he could on a
 spaceship. He also admits that he has never felt a ki as strong as Brolly's
 before. Meanwhile, Paragas is surveying the ever-approaching comet, while
 Kuririn, Oolong, and Roshi have departed. Piccolo grabs Vegeta, and tries to
 get him to help them fight, but Vegeta is scared of Brolly's power. Piccolo is
 ashamed that a prince could be so cowardly, so he drops him to the ground, and
 flies back to the battlefield. Lying in the rubble, Vegeta asks himself the
 reason they continue to fight, though they know they can't win. He finally
 renounces his fear, and joins his allies on the field, despite the fact that it
 probably won't change things.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Paragas is making his way to his space pod. Only
 a few hours remain until the comet will make contact. He decides that since he
 no longer has control over Brolly, he will just let him die along with the
 planet. But just before Paragas can launch off, Brolly shows up and asks him
 where he's going. He sees that his father has only been using him for all these
 years, so he takes the ship, crushes it with his father still inside, and
 throws it into the comet. Though this may seem harsh, Paragas mentions that it
 is the cursed destiny of the Saiya-jin for the son to kill the father. It would
 seem that Brolly has won. Everyone is out of the game, and he's free to move
 on. But Goku is one that will never say die. He walks confidently towards
 Brolly, his body mangled, his power spent, but his spirit still intact. Piccolo
 utters that everyone give Goku what power they still have left. Vegeta is the
 only one to refuse. Goku still doesn't have what it takes to kill the monster.
 Brolly begins to stomp repeatedly on Goku's chest, resulting in massive damage.
 All the while the comet is getting closer and closer. Goku is still taking
 punishment; he just can't do it without Vegeta's energy. Brolly is getting
 incredibly pissed off at Goku, and how he just won't give up, though his pain
 is intense. Finally, Vegeta abandons his status, and begins to give him his
 power. Just as Brolly is about to deliver the final blow, Goku catches his
 fist, and lets off a supercharge of energy, that bewilders Brolly, and makes
 him back off a bit. One by one, each of the warriors tap out of their energy,
 and leave it all up to Goku. The comet is within the atmosphere of the planet,
 and the ground is beginning to break apart, both warriors charge at each other,
 at the same speed. Brolly gets above Goku, and is ready to slam Goku from
 above, just as Goku uppercuts him blisteringly hard into the gut, twisting his
 fist as he goes. Brolly flashes back to when they were babies in the hospital,
 and Goku's crying was making him cry as well, then it was all over. Goku's
 punch hit him so hard that it burst right through his stomach, and made him
 explode in a fiery array of light. Goku fell back and shouted &quot;WE BEAT
 HIM!&quot; just as the planet was disintegrated by the comet.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So what happened to the good guys? Goku
 teleported all his friends and the slaves to the ship being flown by Kuririn,
 Roshi, and Oolong. Goku gives the camera a peace sign, and teleports home with
 Gohan. There they meet a disgruntled Chi Chi who complains to Goku that they've
 been gone so long that Spring Break is over. To this Goku replies, &quot;My
 hobbies are reading and sports!&quot; Chi Chi falls over, and Goku and Gohan
 rush to check on her. The universe is safe once again.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>My Thoughts:<br>
 </b>What a movie. This is one of my favorites, by far. The animation is
 excellent, Brolly's character has yet to become stale, and the musical score is
 well done. Unlike several of the DBZ movies, this one has a really strong plot,
 with quite a bit of thought put into it. Brolly's past is orchestrated with
 style, and there is more than one struggle presented to the viewer. You see,
 the majority of Dragonball Z's movies play out more or less as a simple fight
 between good and evil, but this one also conveys the story of a father's loss
 of everything. He loses his residence, his faith, his control, and eventually
 his life at the hands of his own son, and we realize that this is just how it's
 supposed to happen. Vegeta's insecurity is interesting to behold, if you know
 the character well enough. He's reduced to something very much unlike himself,
 something unlike himself. He's typically a confident and strong warrior, but
 when it came to something that he was unsure of, he just couldn't handle it.
 This is perhaps used as a tactic to reassure us that Goku has a high level of
 spirit energy, and that's why he's eventually going to have what it takes to
 beat Brolly. It makes it all the more rewarding to eventually see Vegeta
 overcome his fears and take on Brolly. I really suggest that you check out this
 movie if you've yet to do so. You won't be disappointed</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>So here's my score:<br>
 </b>10 out of 10</font></p>
