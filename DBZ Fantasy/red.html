Dragonball Z Red Ribbon Army Ranks</font></b></h3>
		  
<h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Here, you can find out 
all you didn't want to know about the Red Ribbon Army. Take a look, there may be 
something here you didn't know.</font></h3>
		  
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in">
<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Red Ribbon Army</b> - This 
army was something that Goku defeated all on his own. The army was controlled by 
a short man name Commander Red. He was always upset when Assistant Black would 
stand next to him, because, Black was one of the tallest people that helped him 
out to control the world. He tried to collect the Dragon Ball's to become 
taller, but everyone thought he wanted them to rule the world. When Assistant 
Black found out about the real wish, he shot Red, and renamed the Army to the 
Black Ribbon Army. However, it was only for a short while, because, Goku just 
came in to stop them, and, Black lost in a big blast battle.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in">
<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Commander Red</b> - The 
main head of the Red Ribbon. He instructed however he wanted in his army to do 
whatever he wanted. However, he was a very small man. His main purpose for 
collecting the Dragon Ball's was to become taller. Everyone thought he wanted to 
control the world. When Assistant Black found out about the real wish, Black got 
mad, and shot Red in the head, thus, he renamed it to the Black Ribbon Army.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in">
<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Assistant Black</b> - Red's 
right hand man. Black usually just stood around and told that whatever Red did 
was right, although, he really hated his job. He was a very tall black man, who 
made Red very mad every time he stood next to him. When Black found out about 
the wish that Red really wanted to make, he shot him dead in the head, and, 
renamed the army to Black Ribbon Army. Goku fought him in Black's metal suit, 
but, Goku killed him, by going straight through the suit, thus, making it 
explode.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in">
<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>General Blue</b> - One of 
the high-ranking officers of the Red Ribbon Army. Although he was very strong, 
he was also gay. He had a special technique that he could paralyze people, where 
they couldn't move, thus, Blue could go into an attack and defeat them. He 
chased Goku around a lot to find the Dragon Balls. He also fought a lot of other 
people to get away and go back the RR HQ. When he got to the HQ, Red looked on 
his dragon radar and saw that he missed a ball where he was. In the Dragon Ball 
series, his death was to fight Tao Pai Pai, and, lost by Tao sticking his tongue 
on a pressure point on his head. In the 10th Anniversary movie, his death was 
execution by some low level privates. They dragged him in a room and shot him to 
death.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in">
<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>General White</b> - General 
of the Muscle Tower. He took control over Android 8, Monster Buyon, Sergeant 
Purple, and Sergeant Metallic. He had a Dragon Ball that Goku wanted, and, he 
also hurt many people in the village outside of the Tower. Goku didn't like 
that, so he went to go fight him. After Goku had defeated every person in the 
tower, he went after White. White had the mayor held captive and threatened to 
kill the mayor if need be. Goku didn't move one bit, but he was the one that got 
shot anyway. But, this was no ordinary gun. This gun contained very powerful 
bullets. After Goku fell, White tried to fire again, but Android 8 blocked it. 
Android 8 went into a rage and charged White. He then blew White out of the 
tower, sending him to a snowy grave.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in">
<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>General Copper</b> - 
Although we don't see him in the manga, he controls Captain Yellow, Captain 
Violet, and Captain Silver. He commands them all to find the Dragon Ball's, so 
he could take them back to Red, and get all the credit.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in">
<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Captain Yellow</b> - We see 
him briefly in the manga and anime, but he goes around trying to find the Dragon 
Ball's for General Copper. That is basically all we see him do.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in">
<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Captain Violet</b> - We see 
her briefly in the anime, but, never in the manga. She gives a Dragon Ball to 
General Copper, and, is never seen again.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in">
<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Captain Silver</b> - The 
first of the high-ranking officers that Goku fights. This is a very short fight. 
Silver let his guard down completely, because, he didn't know Goku had a lot of 
strength. After Goku defeated Silver, he got a Dragon Ball and ran off. Silver 
then told Copper what happened, and, saw he was heading north, so, he told 
Copper to tell White in Muscle Tower to be ready for a very strong boy.</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in">
<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Android 8</b> - The first 
of the Androids we see in the series. He is ordered to fight Goku under Sergeant 
Purple's orders, but refuses. Purple threatens to make him explode if he 
doesn't, but Android 8 said he would rather die than fight. Goku couldn't bear 
to see this so, he knocked out Purple. Android 8 was so happy; he gave Goku the 
Dragon Ball he stole. They then went up the muscle together, fighting monster 
Buyon and General White. He got very mad at White, when he shot Goku, and Goku 
didn't get up. He then hit White so hard; he went straight out the tower's wall 
and fell into the snow. Android 8 went to go live with the mayor, and, is seen 
briefly again at the end of the Buu saga, giving some of his power to build the 
ultimate Genki Dama.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in">
<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Monster Buyon</b> - A very 
fat and giggly monster. He is located in the secret fifth floor of the muscle 
tower. When Goku was on the fourth floor with Android 8, Goku asked what was on 
the fifth floor. Android 8 said there was no fifth floor. So, they went to 
General White. White then opened a hatch to a very dark fifth room with the 
monster Buyon. Goku tried every way possible to kill him. He blasted a 
Kamehameha at him, but, it went right back at Goku. Goku tried hitting him, but 
Goku just fell back. The monster almost ate Goku, but he got an idea. He 
remember how cold it was outside, and how it made him frozen. He blasted a 
Kamehameha at the wall, and a blast of cold air came in, and froze Buyon. He 
then punched Buyon, and flew straight to the sixth floor.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in">
<font face="Arial" size="2">S<b>ergeant Purple</b> - A 
very slick ninja, that couldn't seem to outwit Goku. At first, he tried to throw 
sharp stars at him, but, Goku saw where he threw him, and, shot back at Purple. 
Purple then vanished when he threw his smoke bomb on the ground, and, hid behind 
an American flag. Goku said he was there, and, Purple got made, and turned the 
sheet around, making it look like a tree trunk, because he was hiding next to a 
tree. Purple then told him to count to 30, but Goku couldn't count past 18. Goku 
asked for helped and turned around. Purple was trying to hide under a fake rock, 
and told Goku how to count again. Goku counted to 30, and, saw Purple under 
water with a blow stick so he could breath. Goku went and got some hot tea, and 
poured it down the stick. Purple didn't like that. Purple broke into a run, and, 
Goku raced after him, keeping no trouble at all, so, Purple threw more sharp 
stars down, and Goku slowed down. But, Goku put on some shoes that increased his 
height a bit, and he couldn't feel the stars. Goku then chased after Purple with 
no problem. All this time, White was watching, and, getting irritated. Now, 
Purple wanted to fight. So, he went into the air and took a dive after Goku. 
But, Goku put his Niyoibo under him, and, stuck it in Purple's butt. Then, Goku 
broke Purple's sword. Purple threw more stars at Goku, and then made a getaway. 
Goku picked up the stars, and followed Purple into the house. Purple then 
crouched to the ground, and picked up some tatami flip mats. When Goku threw the 
stars at Purple, Purple would pick up the mats, and, block the stars. But, 
Purple ran out of mats and Goku had another star. Purple then got a star to the 
head. Purple then put another smoke ball down, and, ran for the lake. He put 
some float shoes on, and, crossed a piranha-infested water. Goku said, no 
problem, and jumped straight over the lake. Now, Purple did his ultimate attack. 
He split himself into 5 other people. Goku went into a huge fight, and defeated 
them all. Now, we enter Android 8. Purple ran into the tower again, and, let 
loose Android 8. He told 8 to fight Goku, but he refused. Purple threatened to 
blow him up, and Android 8 said he would rather blow up then die. Goku then 
knocked Purple out before he could blow him up.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in">
<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Sergeant Metallic</b> - 
Goku went into a huge fight with this enormous robot. Goku tried all he could to 
fight him, but, metallic was so hard, Goku kept getting numb in his hands. 
Metallic went into a charge on Goku, and Goku used his Kamehameha to blow him 
away. But, Metallic just lost his head and a little bit of his clothes. Goku 
didn't know what to think. Metallic went after him again for one more attack, 
but, stopped before Goku could attack. Goku just left him and went to the fourth 
floor.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in">
<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Dr. Frappe</b> - The 
original creator of the androids. In the anime, Akira Toriyama added this doctor 
into the story, just to have another hostage for Purple. But, you have to 
remember, Dr. Gero was years off before Akira was thinking of the Cell saga. 
But, all Dr. Frappe did was stick around, be a hostage, and leave.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in">
<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Dr. Gero</b> - THE original 
creator of every android, and a very pissed man at Goku. He devoted his life to 
get back at Goku for destroying his creations. We see him as Android 20 in the 
Cell Saga.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in">
<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Facts</b>: Tao Pai Pai is 
not part of the Red Ribbon Army, although he does take part in it. He was just 
an assassin for hire, and, took the job. Although he got paid and did his job, 
Goku did destroy Tao Pai Pai, after being blown up by a grenade. His name means 
Peach White White.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in">
<font face="Arial" size="2">Black is the only villain that 
Goku fights in the series. He is a very tall man, and kills Red after finding 
out he wanted the Dragon Balls to become taller. He is one of the rare African 
American's that shows up in the series. Although we see other African American's 
in the manga, he is the main one we see. No, Mr. Popo is not an African 
American; he is just a creature with black skin.</font>
