<p><I>For those of you who have read "Raditz's Return", the prolog will
look very familiar--if from a different point-of-view. For those of
you who haven't read "Raditz's Return", this story is a direct sequel;
if you haven't read "Raditz's Return", go read it now!  This story
will make a lot more sense if you do.

<H1><A NAME="Prologue">PROLOGUE: HELL</A></H1>
<p>
The man who lept from ledge to ledge down the seared, black cliffs to
the burning plain might have been mistaken for human, except for the
too-large eyes of a nocturnal predator, and the stiff, upswept crest
of hair that no human ever grew. The man was small, but powerfully
built, and he searched for another of his race.
<p>
Yes, there he was!  On the burning plain, hunting some minor demon,
just as Bardock had said. The man approached him, silently; he watched
the tall, long-maned warrior finish the hunt, slicing the demon apart
with his blade.
<p>
The man frowned; a Saiyan warrior using a sword? "Feh. A sword,
Raditz? I didn't think you'd fallen that far!"
<p>
Raditz answered without turning to look at the smaller man. "The mara
is an energy vampire, Vegeta. It feeds on soul force.  My blade is as
steel; it has neither passion nor energy; it's just sharp." His voice
turned faintly mocking. "I'd be happy to let you fight it, but then
I'd have to clean up the mess."  He finally turned, carefully keeping
the writhing demon's head pinned with the blade, to look at his former
partner and prince.
<p>
"Hmmph! So don't blast it, just hit it." Prince Vegeta aimed a
vicious kick at the demon's head; the tall warrior blocked it. Anger
flashed in Vegeta's eyes; he wasn't in the mood for insolence.
"You dare?"
<p>
Raditz grinned unpleasantly. "The mara drains soul force by
touch--yours or its. You really don't want to finish that kick!" He
paused to let that sink in. "He's weak now--I haven't let him feed for
days--but you should see him all charged up.  Heh. The maras hang
around the borderland, looking for mortals whose spirits are wandering
in dreams--then they harry them all night, sucking ki out of their
souls and giving them nightmares in return.  Good for me Earth mortals
are so weak; maras can't do much more than look really ugly from what
they steal.  Too bad for Earth mortals they are so weak--they die or
go mad from the life theft if it keeps up."
<p>
Vegeta had little interest in the travails of Earth's weakling
mortals, but the demon's powers intrigued him. Vegeta laughed; a cold,
malicious sound.  "So blasting the little bastard would make him
stronger, would it?  And he'd steal my strength if I fought him
hand-to-hand? That would be a tricky fight.. an interesting fight! Are
there other demons like him?"
<p>
"There are.  Why do you think the Saiyajin Demon Guard--my outfit--all
carry swords?" Raditz took out a small black stone, and stopped, looking
quizzically at Vegeta.  "When did you get here?  Did you die recently,
Vegeta, or am I clueless as usual?"
<p>
Privately, Vegeta thought Raditz was clueless as usual, but.. "Not
much more than a week ago."
<p>
The short, dark-haired saiyan frowned, and spent some time
straightening out his white gloves. How to put this to Raditz? The
Prince of the Saiyajin did not go begging to anyone, much less a mere
first-class warrior!
<p>
"There is a problem--I've already been wished back once with Earth's
dragonballs, and no one knows where Namek's dragonballs or the Nameks
are.  They can't wish me back."
<p>
"I could have been wished back with the dragonballs--funny how that
never happened. Sympathy isn't one of my virtues, Vegeta." Raditz
abruptly clapped the black stone to the demon's head, and watched
coldly as the demon's head and body dissolved into mist and seeped
into the stone.
<p>
Damn! He's still bitter about that.. 'waste of a wish'. He'll be of no
use to me. I had hoped his old loyalty--no. So be it. "I was better
off without you," Vegeta said coldly, as he turned and walked away.
<p>
Behind him, Raditz sighed. "Wait, Vegeta."
<p>
"Why?"
<p>
"I shouldn't have said that. I dug my own grave, and I didn't leave
many friends behind. I've no right to complain.."
<p>
Vegeta stopped, and turned back. He had trouble believing what he'd
just heard. Raditz sounded.. almost.. repentant--and not bitter.
"Did you leave any friends at all behind?"
<p>
"One." Raditz smiled to himself.
<p>
"Not me!" The idea that a mere warrior would be that familiar to his
prince!
<p>
"Vegeta, you were my prince and I was loyal to you unto death, but you
were always 'the strong man who stands alone, above all'. Remember?"
<p>
"Yes, I know. Who--"
<p>
"Nappa. He was a good friend, mentor, and teacher--and he would have
wished me back if he'd had the chance. He told me that much." Raditz
spoke quietly. "I would have wished him back."
<p>
Vegeta winced at the silent accusation striking home. It had not been
easy, facing Nappa again. "Nappa should not have lost to a mere
third-class warrior like Kakarott." Vegeta closed his eyes, and
half-turned away, the regret in his face belying his callous words.
<p>
Raditz looked at Vegeta, astonished. He opened his mouth as if to say
something, then thought better of it.  Although Raditz's emotions were
written all over his face, as always, Prince Vegeta noted with
approval that Raditz had finally learned that sometimes it is wiser to
keep silent.
<p>
Perhaps he can serve me in this--only 'serve' isn't the right word,
is it? Damn it, I'm the Prince of the Saiyajin, I don't ASK anyone for
help!
<p>
"I don't have friends here," Vegeta said. "Though my father is.. my
ally in this.  There's only you, or Nappa, and Nappa--"
<p>
"--is still a bit peeved at you for killing him." Raditz regarded his
fallen prince thoughtfully. "When did you ever have any use for
friends?"
<p>
He's learned to think, too. If Raditz had lived, he might have been
truly dangerous someday, and a worthy.. ally. Let's see how he handles
the truth. Vegeta smirked.
<p>
"I never had a use for them, but they're a nuisance I've acquired
along with my wife and son. However, they're all alive and not
here. By the way, how is Nappa otherwise?"
<p>
Raditz just stood there. "Wife.. and.. son?" He blinked. "Wife and
son? You have a wife and son?"
<p>
Now I can see the resemblance between him and Kakarott! They both get
that same stupid look like they've been smacked between the eyes with
a large rock.
<p>
"It does happen--we choose a mate, we have children.. I have heard
that such a thing might have happened with our fathers," Vegeta's
sarcasm was sharp enough to cut.  "Now if you're paying attention.."
<p>
Raditz recovered, managing to look and sound sarcastic himself.  "Oh,
you've got my attention. I'm curious as to what amazing thing I'm
going to hear next."
<p>
"My wife, Bulma--an old friend of Kakarott's--is alone and
unprotected without me.  They can't wish me back. I will find a way
back myself."
<p>
Raditz objected. "That's impossible! You can only go back as a ghost,
and only if the way is opened for you..."
<p>
"I could--and I have, briefly--but I mean to go back as myself, not a
powerless ghost. I have learned that it has been done before, and if
some mere human can do it, so can I!" Vegeta's eyes were wide with
excitement and determination.
<p>
"But how? As far as I know--"
<p>
"There are other hells, deeper hells than this. Other pasts, other
peoples now forgotten went to them.  There are legends of humans and
others escaping, or winning their way back to life from those hells."
<p>
And they were merely weak humans; I am the Prince of the Saiyajin! No
god, no demon, and no number of hells will separate me from my mate
unless I will it! I will find my way back to her, and I will track
that demon down to whatever hell he came from and pay him back for
every tear she has shed! I swear it! Love and hate and rage churned
through Vegeta's soul, a fearsome maelstrom.
<p>
Raditz sensed the unshakeable purpose and fury that drove his
prince--but he also knew, he thought, more of the dangers in what
Vegeta intended. Raditz closed his eyes. "Of course. The mythic
hells." He opened his eyes again. "You would. You can't resist a
challenge like that! You know the way is guarded, don't you?"
<p>
"Of course. I have my father's 'kind permission' to make the attempt;
I also have your father's permission for one other thing."  King
Vegeta, Duke of the Hell of Evil Warriors, had not been overly
enthusiastic about his son's proposed quest, but had grudgingly
acceded.  The occasionallly prescient Commander Bardock, Lord-General
of the Legions of Hell, had been enigmatic but cooperative. At least
he had released Raditz to the task Vegeta needed him to do, at most
the rather cryptic advice he'd offered Vegeta might turn out to be of
some use.
<p>
"What?" Raditz lowered an eyebrow, suspicious.
<p>
Vegeta clenched his jaw; this was so.. humiliating. Only for her could
he do this--at least it was Raditz, and NOT Kakarott.  "I don't know
how long I'll be gone on this.. quest, but I won't be able to watch
over her and protect her while I'm gone. I want you to do that."
<p>
"WHAT????"

<CENTER><P>CONTINUED IN CHAPTER I. UPPER HELL</P></CENTER>
<hr>
<H1><A NAME="Hell">I. UPPER HELL</A></H1>
<p>
After some time, and many words, Raditz stared back at Vegeta, and
finally, slowly, sheathed his all-but-forgotten sword.  He shook his
head. "I still don't know why I let you talk me into this." He
hesitated. "Strike that--yes, I do. But.." he shrugged, looking for
the words and not finding them.
<p>
"But you don't know what I've gotten you into, do you?" Vegeta
smirked, plainly amused. He looked out across the burning plain. Few
beings could find anything amusing in the tormented landscape of Hell,
but what amused Vegeta was visible only to his mind's eye. Suddenly,
he laughed.
<p>
"Trust me, Raditz! It's better than this, at least." He looked
around. "You have to go back. I have to go.. forward." Vegeta
pondered. "According to your father Bardock, the path I must follow
starts somewhere around here, and is guarded by two ogres."
<p>
It was Raditz's turn to smirk. "Oh, Slack and Slacker!  I know those
two clowns; a couple of lazy-ass lesser oni. They keep order in the
uppermost Hell, the one for selfish, indecisive fools."
<p>
"'Lesser' oni? Compared to what? The bull-demons?" Vegeta frowned.
<p>
Raditz chuckled. "Oh, you've met the gozu-oni? Yes, I guess you would
have, if you've spoken with your father. They're strong. But no, these
guys are weaker, a lot weaker. One of them is a speedster, but no
faster than a good Saiyan warrior, and the other fancies himself a
strongman. Again, not so strong as we are. They're liars and cheats,
though. You can't trust what they say unless you force the truth out
of them."
<p>
Vegeta smiled evilly. "So I might have to force the truth out of them?
How.. unfortunate."
<p>
"Yeah. Real unfortunate." The anticipatory gleam in Raditz's eyes
matched Vegeta's. "I have to go that way, anyway, to add this stone,"
he tossed the black demon stone from hand to hand, "to their 'rock
garden'. I can guide you that far, at least.. my prince."
<p>
A short while later, they ascended the seared, black cliffs overlooking the
burning plain, leaping from ledge to ledge to the top. Raditz paused
to rest, and to point out a few landmarks.
<p>
"Over there, beyond their little Camp for Losers, are Lord Enma's
peach trees. Slack and Slacker are supposed to guard those, too, and
not allow anyone to eat fruit from them." Raditz laughed.
<p>
"So how many of those peaches have you eaten, Raditz?" Vegeta smirked.
<p>
"At least one." Raditz grinned. "Those are the Peaches of
Immortality-- too bad the immortality part only works for the living
and for gods. Dead, damned bastards like us just get stronger, faster,
tougher in spirit--and it regenerates our ki, our life force, which
doesn't regenerate real well here. Not surprising, since we're
dead. With the trip you're planning, some fresh fruit might prove a
welcome snack along the way."
<p>
He smirked. "Now, I go distract those clowns, and you get
the peaches. They know I was hunting down there--they'd be expecting
to see me come by sooner or later--they won't be suspicious of me."
<p>
"You actually planned this!" Vegeta said mockingly.
<p>
Raditz looked hurt. "I always have a plan--I just like to keep my
plans simple. And sometimes things just don't go as planned."
<p>
"Hmmph. Why bother with the games? If they are weaker, just take the
peaches!" Vegeta waited; he was beginning to realize that Raditz had a
reason for the seemingly odd things he did here.
<p>
"Then they know for sure that we took the peaches, and that we can
take peaches any time we want. If THAT happens, Lord Enma replaces
them with something a lot tougher to guard his precious fruits, and no
more free ki for us Demon Guardsmen. But, if Slack and Slacker down
there aren't sure what happened, they keep their mouths shut and don't
tell Lord Enma, because then their asses are on the line for failing
to guard the tree."
<p>
Raditz shook his long hair back. "It's not too bad for us, considering
we're all dead and damned--but it's different. In some ways, REALLY
different. And we have to play the game by the rules of here, not by
the old rules of Vegetasai."
<p>
Vegeta harkened to the warning in Raditz's voice. "I'm listening."
<p>
"You already know you can't die, since you're already dead--but you
sure can hurt like it all over again." Raditz started ticking things
off on his fingers. "And there are things--like the ki-vampire demons
I mentioned--that can make sure you're not good for much after they
get done with you. Losing all your remaining ki, losing all your
memories, losing your very form and identity--not fun."
<p>
He continued, "Here, you don't get stronger from a beating--unless you
learn something from it. That one took me a long time to understand;
it took me even longer to find out that I didn't have to get beaten up
to learn something." Raditz smiled wryly.
<p>
"Oh, yeah," Raditz added, "time is subjective."
<p>
"What?" Vegeta looked disturbed.
<p>
"How long have I been dead, Vegeta?"
<p>
"Eight years. Don't you know that?"
<p>
"No, I didn't. I'm only absolutely sure of the first two years, plus
some time after that. There is something about this realm that keeps
everything from happening in the same place at the same time, but it
isn't exactly like what you'd think of as Space and Time.  For one
thing, it changes depending on what you are doing, or how you look at
it, or whatever."
<p>
Raditz looked at Vegeta with concern, and continued, emphasizing his
words carefully. "The further you get from the mortal world, the
vaguer Time gets, and you're going into the mythic hells--further from
the mortal world than anything short of Chaos itself. Even if you
succeed in returning to life, you might find that a thousand years
have passed while you were gone."
<p>
Vegeta was wide-eyed and very worried. "There must be a way around it!
I will not be stopped before I even get started!"  He thought for a
time. "Why are you sure of the first two years?"
<p>
Raditz stared off into the distance for a while before continuing. "I
witnessed.. the consequences of all my own stupidity and.. evil. I saw
you kill Nappa--" Vegeta stiffened momentarily, "--and I watched the
battle between you and Kakarott, knowing it was all my doing that
either my brother or my prince would die." He smiled at the irony, "I
never expected that you would both survive! Gods, that was a weight
off my soul!"
<p>
"That was the first year. After Kakarott's battle with Frieza--and
every Saiyan in Hell watched that battle!--as you well know, for you
were there, my prince." Raditz saluted his fallen prince. "That must
have been strange, fighting the same battle in both worlds, living and
dead," he marveled.  "After that battle," Raditz continued, "there was
nothing to bind me to the mortal world, and time, again--except that
time when somebody wished the bunch of us back to fight you and
Kakarott."
<p>
"There is something to bind ME to the mortal world," Vegeta said
softly, almost to himself. In his memories, he held a beautiful
blue-haired woman close, and marveled at a precocious, violet-haired
child. "Bulma. Trunks," he whispered to himself.
<p>
He turned back to Raditz. "Do you know where the path to the mythic
hells is?" Raditz shook his head in negation. "Then I will have to
force the truth out of those oni of yours. Distract them, then go. You
know the path you must take; I will find out the path I must take."
Vegeta smirked in that devilish way of his.
<p>
Raditz nodded, and started down the canyon toward the oni's 'camp'.
<p>
"Raditz.." The long-haired Saiyan looked back at his prince. "Protect
them."

<p>
"AAAAAAAAH!" The red ogre writhed futilely in Vegeta's grasp. "You
didn't have to dislocate my shoulder! You could have just asked!"
<p>
"I did ask, quite nicely." Vegeta kept the ogre's arm twisted
unnaturally behind his back.  "You lied to me. It might have
worked.. once. Too bad for you that Kakarott told me about the
stairway up to Lord Enma's hall, and that I recognized it."
<p>
"It was a joke, okay!  Can't any of you Saiyajin take a joke?" The oni
demon was sweating heavily; he could expect no help from his
partner. The blue ogre was embedded head downward quite deeply in the
banks of the Pool of Blood, and would be a long time digging himself
out.
<p>
"My favorite jokes usually involve someone's violent death. As you can
see, I naturally don't 'take jokes' very well."
<p>
"Yikes! You belong down below the Pool of Blood, what are you doing
up here bothering us?" The red ogre whined.
<p>
"I was down below, I came up for the scenery. I already told you what
I want--don't annoy me more than you have already. Or are you one of
those perverts who enjoys his own pain?"  Vegeta twisted the ogre's
loose shoulder again.
<p>
"AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH! DO I LOOK LIKE I'M ENJOYING THIS?? ALL RIGHT,
ALREADY! I'll guide you to the Cave of Avernus, I really will this
time! Just let my arm go!"
<p>
"I don't think I will. I'll keep it, until I see this cave. If I think
you've tricked me again, you've got a second arm." Vegeta was smiling
now.

<CENTER><P>CONTINUED IN CHAPTER II. DIRE WOOD</P></CENTER>
<hr>
<H1><A NAME="Dire">II. DIRE WOOD</A></H1>
<p>
The cavern sloped steeply downward for countless miles, its silence
and darkness relieved only by the slight glow of power around Prince
Vegeta, and the sound of his footsteps. Vegeta feared he would lose
track of Time in the endless unchanging gloom; only his memories kept
changing.
<p>
Vegeta remembered his first glimpse of her--she was with that bald
idiot Kulilin on Namek, and he had a dragonball. Vegeta had deigned to
ask for the dragonball rather than blasting them into oblivion and
taking it for two reasons: the presence of Kulilin meant Kakarott
couldn't be too far away, and Vegeta wasn't getting in a fight with
Kakarott while he was still fighting running battles with Frieza's
forces--that would have been sheer folly--and second, for some reason
he found the girl very pleasant to look at. Then Zarbon had to show
up.
<p>
He'd almost dismissed the blue-haired girl as a complete idiot after
that; thinking Zarbon was a soft-headed fool like Kakarott just
because he was good-looking! Even that moron Kulilin wasn't that
stupid! She'd certainly changed her attitude about Zarbon after he'd
transformed into the trollish monstrosity that was his ultimate
fighting form--hah! Vegeta grinned to himself; sure, he'd wanted to
fight Zarbon at his best, so the bastard would go to hell knowing he'd
been well and truly beaten by the prince of the Saiyajin--but that
wasn't the only reason he'd goaded Zarbon into transforming. Not the
only reason at all!
<p>
That thought cheered him for a while, another few miles downward. He'd
found out Bulma wasn't an idiot after all--when they'd all been wished
back to Earth. Once she stopped moping around about Kakarott, she'd
taken charge and gotten everyone sorted out and taken care of. So she
couldn't fight; she could handle all those annoying details that made
Vegeta want to go out and fight something rather than deal with them.
And she was, in her own way, a genius.  Hand her an alien machine
she'd never seen before, and within hours she'd have it disassembled
and rebuilt to suit her--and it would probably work better than
before. Sit her at the console of an alien starship, and she'd be
piloting it better than the builders in five minutes.  So she was
physically weak, and seemed to lack basic common sense--Vegeta was
strong enough, and had sense enough for both, and their other
strengths and weaknesses complemented each other so very well!
<p>
She would have made a fine queen of Vegetasai.

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
The tunnel forked. Vegeta frowned; there had been no mention of
this. He reached into his armor and pulled out one of the peaches he
had stashed there and began to eat it as he studied the cavern
carefully.  No, the ogre had not lied; this secondary tunnel was
new--assuming there were such things as erosion and deposition here and
the flowstone in the main tunnel suggested that there were. The stone
was scarred and fused where something had rudely torn a new tunnel
through the floor of Hell.
<p>
Yes; this must be where the demon had smashed his way into the Lower
Hells! He'd thought--he'd hoped--he might find some trace of its
backtrail along this route. He finished the juicy peach and
fastidiously wiped the juice off his gloves. Raditz had been correct;
he could feel his power returning. Until now, Vegeta hadn't realized
just how much he had lost from death and the demon's near-rape of his
soul.
<p>
Accursed monstrosity! Not content with killing him, the demon had
attacked him in the spirit world after Kakarott destroyed the
monster's physical form.
<p>
Demon-slain, he'd been caught in the borderland between one world and
the next, unable to find his way to the underworld and peace. For
days, Vegeta had drifted, a near-powerless ghost; he'd witnessed
Bulma's terrible grief, the broken despair in which she'd cried
herself to sleep every night. Her pain, and his helplessness to do
anything about it nearly tore him apart--and then the wounded demon
had come after him, hungry for his remaining power and soul-essence.
<p>
He'd been snatched from the demon's claws by one he never
expected--his father, King Vegeta. From the Hell he and his most
powerful warriors had come, in pursuit of the abomination, and found
in its path his dead, broken son. The last prince of Vegetasai once
again ended life as he began it, held in the strong arms of his proud
father.
<p>
"Forget your pride, my child! Fate alone brought me to you in time,
and you shall NOT be meat for this abomination's hunger!" King Vegeta
was grim as he escorted his slain son to his kingdom. "That thing has
threatened my kingdom, and nothing and no one has stood against
it--except you and Kakarott and Kakarott's whelp!"
<p>
"Threatened YOUR kingdom? But your kingdom is.. Hell."
<p>
Later, Vegeta learned what his father had meant. The demon that had
killed him had come through the lower hells on its way to Earth. It
had erupted from below, tearing its way up from the forgotten, mythic
hells to smash its way through the lower hells to its goal--a rift
leading to Earth. A forbidden goal, for things of the hells may not
freely walk the physical world--though some of them have tried, and a
few succeeded.  It was the purpose of the Demon Guard to stop such
violations of reality.
<p>
They'd tried to stop it, damned Saiyans, great Ouzaru, and Hell's own
demons alike--nothing had stood before it. Saiyans, Gozu-Oni, other
monsters had been swept aside like straws in a hurricane. It was no
demon of any Hell known to King Vegeta, or Commander Bardock, or even
the little blue demons of the Bureaucracy, who knew everything. It
came from the forgotten past, and it pursued its goal with unstoppable
fury.
<p>
Its goal had been a mystery, save for this: its single-minded goal had
been the rift to Earth. And on Earth.. Vegeta shuddered, remembering
the thing's obsession with Gohan--and his own family. Its goal had
been their despair and death--but why?  What had brought this
unspeakable monstrosity howling out of the abyss for his blood? It
made no sense!
<p>
Prince Vegeta did not like things that made no sense; in his
experience, there was always a reason behind even apparently senseless
acts.  The apparent senselessness only meant that the reasons were
hidden from him.  Vegeta especially did not like things with hidden
reasons that brought death and destruction on him and his family.  He
would find his way back, as he had told Raditz; but he would also find
out the hidden reasons.
<p>
"You really shouldn't have killed me, demon!" His voice echoed off the
tunnel walls. "You don't know what kind of enemy you've made, do you?"
He idly tossed the peach pit in one hand. "Good. Remain ignorant; I
will not!" Vegeta tucked the pit in his armor, and continued down into
the depths.

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Vegeta blinked as he emerged into the light. It wasn't much light,
only a grey dreariness overhanging the wood, but it nearly blinded him
after the unrelieved darkness of the tunnel.  And what a wood! An
endless expanse of black, leafless trees spread before him. Not the
black of rain-darkened wood, or even ebony, but pure, obsidian
blackness.  Even the ground below his feet was black, like some
volcanic sand beach. Black soil, black pebbles, black moss, everything
black.
<p>
Nothing moved. A few questionable paths seemed to wind into the woods;
Vegeta did not trust them. "Now what?  Somewhere in all this is a
guide to the next underworld; so Bardock said. Hmmph. And I see no
signs of the demon's backtrail." Vegeta frowned.
<p>
He listened. A cold wind seemed to sigh and moan through the dire
woods; still nothing moved. He could sense no powers, but Vegeta
wasn't sure how that worked here.
<p>
A flash of color, of movement!  Vegeta turned; it was gone--no, there
it was! A flash of gold amid the blackness. It was something; Vegeta
ran after it.
<p>
A glade of black grass in the forest; across it from the fallen prince
stood a deer, a silver-spotted golden deer with ivory antlers and
flint-black hooves, a sapphire-blue metal face, amethyst eyes, bright
red tongue and a pale-pink belly. He held his tail straight up and
arched his neck a little and ran off.
<p>
"What kind of deer is that? Earth has no such creature!" Vegeta stared
after it in astonishment. Finally, he laughed.  "The little deer wants
to play! Well, some venison would be quite tasty after that peach." He
ran after the golden deer, fleeter of foot than any earthly animal.
<p>
Now and then the deer seemed to tire, or lose its way, and Vegeta
almost caught up with it--but the creature would put on another burst
of speed, and leave him behind. The prince never quite lost sight of
the darting flash of gold in the black, black wood, and always managed
to almost catch up with it.. Time slipped away as he pursued the
deceptive golden deer, days and weeks of time, while a grieving wife
searched for a wish, a ghost found a friend in an innocent child, and
an ancient evil stirred to wakefulness, only to be brought down by the
living and the dead.

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Somewhere in the borderlands between spirit and life, a foulness bided
its time.  Its curse had begun; in slaying the one, it had brought
grief and despair to the mate and child and friends.  Soon, soon, it
would be ready to strike again. The unexpected hero had been stronger
than any it had ever fought before; the hero had defeated it,
dispersing its physical form; it would prepare carefully before
fighting that one again.  But it was confident; now it recognized the
hero's kind, and knew their strengths and weaknesses. It would return
in a form designed to defeat all their strengths, and prey on their
weaknesses.

<hr>
<H1><A NAME="Way">III. ALONG THE WAY</A></H1>
<p>
In the mountain valley below Black Earth Mountain, Bulma sighed and
finally slammed the trunk lid. She was surprised; it wasn't even noon
yet. The wild frenzy of the last battle with the Opawang, Raditz's
second death, Gohan's furious pursuit of the evil sorceror, the final
destruction of the Opawang, the freeing of the two kami, and Raditz's
second resurrection had all happened in less than an hour.{1} Rounding
up scattered gear, accepting the gratitude of the villagers, and
getting the kids into the car had taken longer.
<p>
Gohan had spent most of that time discussing something with
Piccolo--Bulma thought that 'something' was probably Raditz, judging
from Piccolo's angry glances and Gohan's gestures in the Saiyan's
direction. For a while, the discussion seemed more like an argument,
but they finally settled whatever it was and calmed down.
<p>
Goku got the kids settled down, and Raditz made himself useful helping
Bulma get everything else rounded up.
<p>
"Okay, guys! I'd love to drive everyone back, but this is only a
four-seater, and I'm not packing the kids in the trunk, even if that's
the way they came in the first place. One of you can hold Goten in his
lap, and Trunks is riding with me, so that means two of you can ride
in the car." She looked hard at Gohan. "And I really think one of you
should be Gohan, because you're looking pretty bushed right now."
<p>
Gohan nodded tiredly in agreement, and looked at the other adults
questioningly.
<p>
"I don't need a ride, I'm not going back that way." Piccolo growled,
then smiled at Gohan. "Take care of yourself, Gohan." He gave Raditz
one last suspicious glare, and flew off, rapidly disappearing into the
distance.
<p>
Goku looked Raditz up and down, once again taking in his rent and
shattered armor and glancing at the myriad streaks of blood still
staining the pavement. He didn't say anything about it, but his
concern was obvious. "I'll just teleport home. See you when you get
there!"  With that, he put two fingers to his forehead and vanished in
a *pop* of displaced air.
<p>
"Kakarott!" Raditz's eyes went wide. "How'd he do that? WHAT did he do?"
<p>
"Oh, yeah, Dad can teleport. He learned it from some aliens on his way
back from Namek." Gohan yawned; he was tired. The fight had taken a
lot out of him.
<p>
"Oh."
<p>
"*Ahem*" Bulma got their attention. "Could we get this show on the
road? The kids are already falling asleep! Raditz, you're the only one
who looks half-way awake, so ride in the front with me, and wake me up
if I start nodding off behind the wheel. Gohan, you hold Goten and sit
with Trunks in back." She waited for everyone to take their
seats. "Let's go!"
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"Hi, Chi-chi!" Goku stuck his head in the back door. "I'm back!"
<p>
"Goku!" Chi-chi dashed out the back door, and quickly looked around
the back yard.  No one else there. "WHERE ARE THEY?" She raised the
cooking spoon she was holding in a threatening manner.
<p>
Goku put his hands up in an impromptu block and backpedalled. "They're
okay, Chi-chi! THEY'RE OKAY! I just teleported home ahead of them!
They'll be here as soon as Bulma can drive over!"
<p>
Chi-chi lowered the spoon. "My babies are okay?" Her evident worry
distressed Goku.
<p>
"They're fine." He hugged her and held her. "Gohan got roughed up a
bit, but nothing a bath and dinner won't fix.  Goten's fine, just
tired. It was all over by the time Piccolo and I got there, and
everyone is okay. You'll see." Goku smiled. "But they're all going to
be starving!"
<p>
"All over?  So something DID happen? But they're okay?" Chi-chi seemed
unconvinced that everything was really okay.
<p>
"Something did happen, but Bulma wouldn't tell me until after everyone
got home and had dinner, so I guess we'll have to wait. Everyone is
really okay--just a few cuts and bruises at worst." Goku hugged
Chi-chi again, then stood back and looked at her, grinning.
<p>
Chi-chi couldn't help smiling back. "I guess you wouldn't be so happy
if someone had gotten hurt and you were just trying to spare me the
worry." She headed back inside.  "I sent Kulilin off with a grocery
list, and everyone else is in the living room. I'm getting some snacks
together now; there should be some hot tea left in the pot on the
table."
<p>
"Everyone else?" Goku wondered. Then Master Roshi entered the
kitchen.
<p>
"Hello, Goku! Everyone's okay, then?" Goku's old sensei looked
delighted to see him unscathed.
<p>
"Master Roshi! This is a nice surprise; what are you doing here? And
Kulilin, too?" Goku looked puzzled.
<p>
"And me and Tenshinhan and Chaozu!" Yamcha stuck his head in the
kitchen. "Don't forget me!" came the high voice of Puar from somewhere
in the living room. Goku looked more puzzled than ever.
<p>
"Chi-chi asked us to help, after you left and she read Bulma's files."
Master Roshi explained, looking serious. "There was some very
disturbing information there--even Chi-chi had no idea HOW
disturbing!--and she was worried about you.. especially.. considering
how Vegeta died."
<p>
It was Goku's turn to look serious. "What do you mean?"
<p>
"Come." Master Roshi led Goku out to the living room, and nodded to
Dr. Briefs, who was sitting at the computer.  "Show Goku."
<p>
With some difficulty, Goku slowly read over the incriminating
"Folklore" files, looking more and more serious as he read. "So that's
what he was talking about!" he muttered to himself.
<p>
Goku looked up, and was all smiles again. "They won, though. Bulma
promised the full story after she got here and had dinner, so stop
worrying!"
<p>
Master Roshi shook his head. "I guess it wasn't what I was worrying
about, then. This," he gestured at the computer's screen, "reminded me
of an ancient--and true--legend of an immortal evil sorceror called
the Opawang. I feared that Bulma had stumbled on that evil, and
great tragedy had befallen us." Master Roshi smiled. "I am more
relieved than you can imagine to know that everything turned out for
the best."
<p>
"Me, too!" spoke up Chaozu. A chorus of "yea! uh-huh!" and general
agreement came from the others. Puar did a few backflips and landed on
Yamcha's shoulder again. Oolong came out from behind the couch where
he'd been hiding.
<p>
Goku smiled, and then frowned. He sniffed the air. "I guess flying all
over with Piccolo worked up a sweat--I'm going to hit the showers
before everyone else gets back. They'll be wanting to use them,
too. And I need to dig out some extra clothes."  With that he headed
down the hall.
<p>
Chi-chi stepped out of the kitchen with a tray of snacks. "Where's
Goku?"
<p>
"Uh, the shower?" volunteered Yamcha as he dove into the snacks.
<p>
Chi-chi looked mildly exasperated. "I wanted to ask him--oh well,
it'll just have to wait." She disappeared back into the
kitchen. Master Roshi thought he heard her mutter something, and
raised an eyebrow. What did she mean by "the fifth Saiyan"?
<p>

<p>
In Hell, in the black wood, Vegeta paused in his long, long chase of
the golden deer.  The creature had stopped; it no longer ran off at
the very edge of sight. What had happened? Wary, Prince Vegeta stalked
the golden deer.
<p>
By the edge of a dark stream the golden deer struggled, caught in the
grasp of a horned, goat-headed demon. A second, diseased-looking
goat-demon stood nearby, leering at the deer.
<p>
"So what do we do with it?" asked the first demon, powerful muscles
bunching as his grip tightened on the helpless animal. "Eat it, or--?"
<p>
"Is it male or female?" the other demon rasped, purple tongue hanging
out.  Oozing sores covered its grey skin, and it drooled.
<p>
"Let me check," the first one said, as it flipped the deer over none
too gently.
<p>
Something about the goat-demons made Vegeta's skin crawl. He stepped
out of the woods. Both demon's heads whipped around as they noticed
him.
<p>
"Whatever THAT is, it's male!" snapped the demon holding the deer.
<p>
The second demon nodded in agreement. "Yeah, but we could still have
some fun with him before we eat him, huh-huh-huh."
<p>
"Do ya think he'll squeal like that other guy?" The first demon
dropped the deer and stalked toward Vegeta, clawed arms spread wide to
catch and tear.
<p>
Vegeta merely stared at the demons in silent contempt as the
over-muscled deer-catcher approached him. He could sense their
power--it was pitifully weak, if tainted and foul. Something familiar
about that foulness..
<p>
"He's stiff with fear! Oh, this is gonna be fun!" The demon giggled
and tried to tackle Vegeta.
<p>
Vegeta wasn't there. Suddenly he was behind the demon, and almost
negligently slammed a elbow into the beast's spine. KRACK! The demon
fell, writhing--but only the top half of his body still moved. A quick
stamp of Vegeta's foot against its skull and the rest of the demon
stopped moving, too. The broken demon dissolved into a powerless wisp
of spirit and seeped away.
<p>
The other demon slurped its purple tongue back into its mouth, and
panicked. It started to run on sharp-nailed, humanoid feet. Vegeta hit
it from behind, thrusting his gloved hand between its ribs and seizing
its black heart. He crushed it, breaking the demon, stealing its
power--
<p>
The demon's essence washed over him, into him; a foul, perverted
distortion of fertility and desire--love twisted inside out into hate;
physical desire perverted into lust and rape; shared pleasure become
the infliction of pain and degradation on the weaker by the stronger,
and fertility twisted into--
<p>
Vegeta cried out, and flung the foul thing away from him. He summoned
power, and flung it, burning and blasting the horrid creature for long
minutes, until no trace of its manifestation remained. He stood,
breathing heavily with emotion and exertion, shaking. Vegeta felt
tainted, befouled by the thing. He raised his head.
<p>
The stream! The dead prince flung himself face down into the bitterly
cold stream, letting water wash over him, wash the foulness
away. Vegeta recognized what was familiar about the demons'
nature. The foulness, the taint, was the same--that same perversion of
nature and reality that made up the essence of the monster that killed
him. He'd found the demon's backtrail--but, oh gods, he could have
happily endured a thousand years of Hell rather than learn what
"broobirth" was!
<p>
Vegeta lay there for uncounted hours, shuddering, while the icy black
waters of Styx's nameless daughter answered his unvoiced prayer and
washed the taint of Chaos away. Finally, he stirred.
<p>
"Vegeta, remember that you are a Saiyan!" he admonished himself, as he
got to his feet again. "Broo.." he spat in disgust. "So they call
themselves. Abominations! Living or spirit, I will destroy them
wherever I find them!" The Saiyan prince looked around.  Across the
stream, the golden deer looked at him timidly, and bounded up the
bank. It stopped, looking back over its shoulder at him.
<p>
"So YOU are my guide, are you? Show me the way, then, and enough of
these games!"
<p>
The deer cocked its head, and almost seemed to nod, then bounded
away. Vegeta swiftly followed.
<p>

<p>
Bulma started as something nudged her shoulder. "Huh?" she said, and
then realized she'd been--
<p>
"You were falling asleep," Raditz said. He was leaning back, letting
the slipstream blow his long hair out straight as he relaxed. His eyes
were half-closed, but an occasional glance in Bulma's direction
betrayed his alertness.
<p>
"Oh. Thanks." She looked around. The kids were all asleep. Gohan
slumped with his head back; Goten slept curled up in his lap. Trunks
lay across the seat with his head against Gohan's hip. Bulma
yawned--and stopped guiltily as Raditz opened his eyes and arched an
eyebrow, watching her.
<p>
"I'm not falling asleep again!" She yawned again. "Okay, I am
tired--last night wasn't the most restful night I've ever spent! How
come you're so bright-eyed and bushy-tailed--er, well, bright-eyed,
anyway?"
<p>
Raditz smirked. "Being revived from death is.. invigorating. Heh. I
guess healing the big things, like being dead, fixes the little stuff,
like being tired, cut and bruised.  I've never felt better in my
life!"
<p>
"Okaaaay.. I think I'll pass on that method of getting my energy back,
thank you. I'm glad you're all better, though."  Bulma adeptly steered
the car through a pass in the lower coastal mountains and picked up a
road to follow.
<p>
Raditz looked thoughtful. "You really are, aren't you?" he said,
wonder in his voice.
<p>
"Yes! Raditz, you're not so bad now that you're off this 'Kakarott has
to join us in exterminating planets or else!' thing you were on.
There's more to you than I would have suspected from our original
meeting-- and, you're like Vegeta--once you drop the arrogant
tough-guy act, you're.." she looked at him critically, "hrmmmm.. very
handsome, and uhm.. very.. masculine.  Ummm-hmmm."  Bulma, she scolded
herself, calm down, you're married!
<p>
He raised an eyebrow. "So human females would find me.. attractive?"
<p>
"You're going to be beating 'em off with a stick--figuratively
speaking. Lose that Saiyan contempt for anyone weaker than you--we
human women don't like to be treated with contempt-- and you'll do
fine."  Bulma was blushing a bit.
<p>
"I see." The corner of his mouth turned up with the hint of a
smile. "This life may turn out more.. interesting than I thought."
Raditz regarded Bulma more seriously. "I do thank you for bringing me
back to life--even unintentionally."
<p>
"I think you mentioned that before, but I wasn't quite sure how to
take it at the time--I couldn't decide between 'shock' and 'terror'."
Bulma smiled wryly. "Little Goten came along at just the right moment,
didn't he?"
<p>
Raditz smiled, remembering. "Yeah, things were getting a bit tense
when the kid jumped me." The big saiyan laughed. "He's been trying to
catch my hair for weeks, and he finally got it--happiest I've ever
seen him. And, what the hell, I was pretty damn happy right then, just
to be alive again! I still am."
<p>
The car swooped low around the shoulder of a mountain; Bulma slowed
down as she looked for landmarks.  "All right! There it is--that
clearing at the end of the road! WAKE UP, KIDS, WE'RE HOME!"

<p>
Yamcha heard the aircar first. "Hey! That must be them! Come on,
everybody!" He ran out the front door and stood in the yard, peering
up at the car silohuetted against the bright sky. Tenshinhan, Chaozu,
and Master Roshi soon joined him.  Goku sauntered out a minute later.
<p>
Master Roshi frowned. "I sense Gohan and the children, and Bulma, but
who's the fifth person? He has some power--nothing like Gohan or you,
Goku, but.." not someone I'd like to get in a fight with in a dark
alley, he thought to himself.
<p>
Goku smiled innocently and said nothing. Master Roshi eyed his former
student suspiciously; what did Goku know that they did not?
<p>
Finally Bulma decided she had the car lined up right, and dropped the
last twenty feet all at once, then settled the car delicately the last
foot onto its skids. Everyone piled out at once, including the very
tall, broad-shouldered, incredibly long-haired, <i>tailed</i> Saiyan in the
most battered, torn-up, and shattered armor anyone had ever seen
anyone wear.  Gohan carried Goten, who was trying to grab the
mysterious Saiyan's hair, and Trunks raced excitedly around his mother
and the big Saiyan warrior.
<p>
Yamcha, Tenshinhan and Chaozu gaped at the mystery Saiyan.
<p>
"Who the heck is that?" Yamcha finally got out, as he looked at his
comrades. Not all of them were as mystified.  Goku was grinning from
ear to ear, as if playing a secret joke on all of them.  Master Roshi
clung desperately to his staff as his knees went weak and shaky. From
the look on his face, he recognized the long-maned Saiyan, and not as
a friend.
<p>
The tall Saiyan stopped and regarded Master Roshi. "You remember me,
elder," he said in a soft, fierce voice. "I don't know these others,
but I do remember you. Where is the other one, the small bald
warrior?"
<p>
Master Roshi had a hard time finding his voice. He looked at his
favorite pupil. "Goku? How--??"
<p>
Chi-chi walked out the front door, still mixing a bowl of
dough. "Goku, I've been trying to ask you--oh! Gohan! Goten! Hold
this, Goku!" She shoved the bowl into his hands, and ran past the tall
Saiyan to hug her children. "You're okay! You really are okay! Let me
see--oh, Gohan, you've been hurt! How'd you get burned like that?
Come inside, I'll get you all fixed up." She looked over her shoulder
at the bemused Saiyan warrior as she marched Gohan inside. "You must be
the fifth Saiyan Bulma said was coming to dinner.  Goku, introduce me
to your new friend after I get Gohan taken care of--and give that
dough to Kulilin, he's helping me out."
<p>
Bulma stood slightly behind and beside the Saiyan, her arms crossed,
tapping her foot impatiently. Trunks held his mother's hand and looked
wide-eyed at the assembled warriors on Son Goku's front porch.
<p>
The tall Saiyan warrior smirked. "Kakarott, you really should
introduce me to your friends.  I seem to be making them nervous."
<p>
Yamcha and Tenshinhan did look disturbed, rattled by Master Roshi's
reaction to the alien warrior. A glimmering of suspicion began in
Yamcha's mind, as he started to remember the one Saiyan that Master
Roshi, Goku and Kulilin had encountered that he had not--a suspicion
promptly confirmed by Goku.
<p>
"Master Roshi, I see you remember my brother Raditz.  Yamcha, Tien,
Chaozu, Raditz is my older brother--I think you heard about him
before. Don't worry, he's okay, now." Goku still looked wonderfully
innocent.
<p>
"Remarkably so, all things considered," Raditz said dryly.
<p>
Yamcha and Tienshinhan and Chaozu just stood open-mouthed with
surprise. Master Roshi, who had already recognized Raditz, recovered
his composure. He squinted at Raditz.
<p>
"I'll say--even Vegeta's armor wasn't that smashed up when he showed
up on Earth after being killed on Namek. Something must have happened
up there in those mountains--you didn't look that bad even after.."
Master Roshi trailed off.
<p>
"..Even after I was dead from my fight with Kakarott?" Raditz pointed
out the circular hole punched through the middle of his torso
armor. "That was Piccolo's work eight years ago. As for the rest--"
<p>
Bulma elbowed Raditz sharply. "Not until AFTER dinner! I want to tell
this story ONCE, not once for each person here. Trust me, you start
spilling it piecemeal, we'll wind up explaining everything ten times
each! I think I spent three months explaining the Namek mess to
everyone, one person at a time--I don't want to do that again!"
<p>
Master Roshi shook his head, still mystified. He ignored Bulma to
address Raditz, "How? Why are you here with Bulma and Gohan?"
<p>
Raditz half-shook his head. "How--part of the story. Why--instead, ask
'why am I here with Bulma and Trunks?' and you'll be closer to the
answer--or do you not remember who one of my 'partners' was?"
<p>
"Of course--Vegeta." Master Roshi nodded. "I think I understand now."
<p>
"Do you?" Raditz asked. "No matter.. I think you will, before the
night is over." With that, he started to follow the impatient Bulma
into the house, asking her something about his scouter, only to stop
as Goku interrupted him.
<p>
"Raditz, I'm forgetting my manners. I introduced you to my friends,
but not my friends to you--this is Master Muten Roshi, the Turtle
Elder, and my first sensei--you do remember him from before, and this
is Yamcha, whom I met a long time ago not long after I met Bulma--
wow, that'll be another whole night to tell THAT story!--and this is
Tenshinhan and Chaozu.. Hmm, that's yet another long story. Let's just
say they're good friends, and among Earth's great warriors. Kulilin's
around here somewhere--he's the other warrior who was with Master
Roshi and me when you showed up the first time, and, um.." Goku
paused.
<p>
"..that's another long story?" Raditz filled in helpfully.
<p>
"Yep." Goku grinned. Raditz impulsively grinned back.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Kulilin wiped his hands on a towel and hurried out of the kitchen,
into the living room. Bulma was just coming in the front door, and was
talking over her shoulder to someone behind her--Goku, Kulilin
supposed.
<p>
"The scouter?" she said. "It broke when Goku and Vegeta were fighting,
but I still have it around somewhere--I always meant to see if I could
repair it, but never got around to it before we dashed off to Namek,
and after that I sort of forgot about it.  Silly of me--there was some
interesting technology in that device, and I could have used it later
on."
<p>
"Hi, Bulma!" Kulilin announced himself, walking up to greet his old
friend. "Hey, funny you should mention that old thing--I had the
weirdest nightmare the other night that Goku's evil brother Raditz had
come back from the dead and was hunting for me because he wanted his
scouter back--"
<p>
As Bulma stepped into the living room, Kulilin suddenly realized he
was face-to-stomach with the person following her into the house--a
very large person in shattered saiyan armor. He looked up.
<p>
Raditz smirked down at Kulilin. "Actually, I do want it back, but just
to show Bulma something."
<p>
"YAAAAHHHH!" Kulilin did a complete backflip across the room and landed
on his feet. His face was dead white and his eyes were wide with pure
terror.  Oolong and Puar looked on in surprise.
<p>
Bulma couldn't help laughing. "Raditz! That.."--she was laughing almost
too hard to talk--"..wasn't very nice!"
<p>
The long-haired Saiyan smiled. "Then why are you laughing so hard?"
<p>
She tried to quell the laughter, but it kept bursting out in
giggles. "Sorry, Kulilin, but you should have seen your face!"
<p>
"..and people call me a coward!" Oolong muttered.
<p>
Kulilin turned red and angry as he recovered from his momentary
panic. "Bulma! What is HE doing here? How did he come back to life?"
<p>
"I invited him, Kulilin, as did Bulma." Goku came in behind Raditz,
who stood with his arms crossed, still amused by Kulilin's reaction.
<p>
"Oh. Well, if you did, I guess it's okay--but I wish you wouldn't
surprise me like this. You could have warned me--"
<p>
Goku shook his head. "I still don't know the whole story
myself. Bulma's waiting until we're all together after dinner."
<p>
"And after a hot bath and a change of clothes, which I'm going to take
care of right now." Bulma looked critically at Raditz. "You already
got a bath at the spring--"
<p>
"--courtesy of a supernaturally beautiful, completely unclad female
nature kami." Raditz had an odd, dreamy expression on his face.
Master Roshi, who'd just squeezed in past Goku, perked up at
this. Raditz sighed. "Too bad I was dead at the time."
<p>
"Now that is one of the most depressing things I've heard yet,"
Muten Roshi muttered.
<p>
Oolong's eyes widened and his ears perked.  "A naked goddess for a
bath girl? I really, really want to hear this story! Bulma, can't
dinner wait 'til later?"
<p>
"OOOOOOHHH!" Bulma was red and furious. "DO YOU TWO PERVERTS MIND??
There are children here!  Raditz, keep the colorful descriptions to
yourself--it only encourages them!" She glared at Oolong and Muten
Roshi, and then turned back to Raditz.
<p>
"--AS I WAS SAYING, you've already had a bath, but you really need a
change of clothes. Any more of your armor falls off, you'll violate
several public decency laws. Trunks, you're next in line for the
shower." Bulma disappeared down the hall without waiting for any
responses.
<p>
Goku handed the mixing bowl to Kulilin and beckoned to Raditz. "Come
on, I've got something for you."  Raditz nodded and followed Goku out
of the room.
<p>
Behind them, Kulilin could be heard: "Man, this is nuts!"
<p>

<p>
"Gohan, honey, you're wiggling more than the baby! Hold still, I'm
almost done. There; we've got all those nasty burns dressed and
bandaged." Chi-chi started to put away the medical supplies, and then
reconsidered.  "I'll leave these out for Bulma; she looked hurt,
too."
<p>
"It's worse than it looks, Mom. You didn't really have to--"
<p>
"Gohan." The tone of her voice warned Gohan; he suddenly grew
silent. "I don't know how you and Bulma managed to find so much
trouble in a peaceful mountain village in Japan, but I've given up
hoping that you and your father will stay out of danger. You seem to
attract it, without even meaning to. But--" she glared at him, "what
were you thinking of, dragging little Goten and Trunks into it?"
<p>
"Mom! I didn't even know they were with us! I didn't--" he shrugged
helplessly at his mother's skeptical frown. "Ask Raditz! He was there,
he knew what the kids were doing long before I did!"
<p>
"Ask who?" Chi-chi looked puzzled.
<p>
Voices drifted down the hall as Goku and Raditz came out of Goku's
room. "Yeah, thanks, Kakarott. Bulma was right--that armor is a
complete loss. No, don't throw it out yet, there's something stashed
in the remote pocket that I want to give to Bulma--assuming it
survived all the abuse that armor's taken in the last eight
years. Heh."
<p>
Raditz wore a blue sleeveless gi and pants, and had tied his hair back
in a loose ponytail. It didn't do much to restrain his hair, which
still exploded all over his back down to below his knees, but at least
it would keep it out of his dinner.
<p>
Chi-chi regarded him quizzically. "Umm, Goku? You never did introduce
me to your friend."
<p>
Goku smacked himself on the forehead. "I'm sorry, Chi-chi, that was
rude of me.  Chi-chi, this is my older brother Raditz. Raditz, this is
my wife Chi-chi--" Goku put his arm around Chi-chi's shoulder to
steady her as she swayed, looking faint.
<p>
She steadied, and a dangerous light glittered in her eyes. Chi-chi
stepped forward to face Raditz. "So you're Goku's brother? You're the
person responsible for Goku getting killed the first time, and you
kidnapped my little baby Gohan--and because of YOU, he was Piccolo's
prisoner for a year!"
<p>
"Mom! Um, mom?" Gohan sounded worried, behind her.
<p>
"Uh, Chi-chi, I--" Goku started to say something, then Raditz stepped
forward.
<p>
"Kakarott, this is mine to deal with, because she's right." He gently
pulled Chi-chi into the nearest empty room--she was too startled to
resist--and looked hard at an equally startled Goku. "Trust me." Then
Raditz closed the door.
<p>
Goku and Gohan could hear Raditz speaking in a low, urgent voice for a
few minutes. Then Chi-chi answered, also in a low voice, followed by
the distinct sound of a slap. Gohan almost flung the door open then,
but Goku restrained him, shaking his head.
<p>
Chi-chi opened the door, looking satisfied with herself. "Goku, your
brother Raditz is welcome to dinner, in fact he is welcome to stay as
long as he likes.  But, honey, next time one of your long-lost,
formerly dead relatives shows up for dinner--let me know ahead of
time, okay?" She smiled sweetly and sauntered down the hall toward the
living room and kitchen.
<p>
Raditz came out looking a bit subdued, and both Goku and Gohan could
see the red print of a hand on Raditz's left cheek. Goku and Gohan
exchanged glances, and Goku shook his head ever so slightly. They
followed Chi-chi's lead, and headed for living room without mentioning
it.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Chi-chi wiped perspiration off her forehead. "Whew! That's the last of
it--Kulilin, call everyone to dinner." As he started to go, she added,
"And Kulilin? Thank you so much for helping. I couldn't have gotten
everything together for this crowd without it."
<p>
"Aw, it was no trouble. I help Eighteen out all the time, since she's
so busy with the baby. She would have come, too, but she had to stay
home with our girl."
<p>
Bulma entered the kitchen. "And I'm glad to hear it, Kulilin. At least
you had the manners to do something besides idle about the house and
watch Chi-chi work! Chi-chi, I'm sorry I couldn't be here to help
sooner, but I'll at least help you serve all this and clean up
afterwords."
<p>
"Thank you, Bulma." Chi-chi smiled. "Do you know that you're sounding
like your old self again?  I told you staying with us would do you
good, girl!"
<p>
"Huh? What's this?" Kulilin asked as they started carrying food out to
the tables.
<p>
"Oh, Bulma was really depressed for weeks after Vegeta died--wasn't
sleeping or eating. I was worried sick about her--you would have been,
too, if you'd seen her."
<p>
Kulilin looked downcast and ashamed. "I guess I should have checked on
Bulma, but Eighteen and I were so busy and worn out with little Marron
being sick and all--"
<p>
"Kulilin! Don't be silly! It's not your fault, and you were right
where you should have been, helping your wife with your kid!" Bulma
looked indignant. "Anyway, I got over the worst part, the nightmares,
the first night here, and..." she trailed off as she looked across the
room at Raditz, who was already helping himself to the rack of ribs at
his end of the table.  "I wonder.." she looked thoughtful, remembering
the dream samurai who had slain the demons of her nightmares--the
samurai that had looked exactly like Raditz.{1}
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Finally, dinner and clean-up were done, and everyone gathered in the
living room. Dr. Briefs and Ox King were the last to arrive, having
eaten early and gotten "out of the way of the busy young folks"
(actually, they'd retired to Ox King's room for an intense game of
chess). Bulma noticed the knowing look Ox King gave to Raditz, and the
slight, almost imperceptible nod Raditz made in response. What the
heck?
<p>
Raditz tossed his shattered armor on the low table in the middle of
the room. "Exhibit A," he cheerfully said. "As I said before, this" he
pointed to the circular hole punched through both front and back, "was
Piccolo's work.  The rest of the damage was the work of one evil,
arrogant bastard whose like I never want to face again--called himself
'The Opawang'--"
<p>
Master Roshi fainted.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"I must be getting old," Master Roshi's voice quavered. "I was trained
better than that by the time I was fifteen." Muten Roshi was stretched
out on the couch; he sat up as a concerned Goku and Kulilin hovered
over him. A damp cloth still clung to his forehead, placed there by an
anxious Chi-chi. He pulled it off.
<p>
Tenshinhan and Yamcha sat nearby, looking worried and just a little
bit scared. Raditz had grabbed a spot on the other couch, but none of
Goku's old friends had felt quite comfortable about sitting that close
to him--so Trunks had grabbed the spot on his right, and Goten had
crawled into Raditz's lap, wrapped himself up in a length of his
uncle's hair, and gone to sleep. That had shocked Kulilin even more
than Raditz's casual mention of the Opawang--little Goten's obvious
familiarity with his uncle, and Raditz's open affection for the little
boy. What had been going on here?
<p>
Master Roshi was puzzled, and worried. "How did you escape, then? I
know the legend of the Opawang--if even part of it is true, he is
immortal and unbeatable." He looked around as if even now the evil
sorceror or his minions might burst in upon them.
<p>
"If your legend mentions that he was immortal, pretty much immune to
damage, absorbed ki-energy like a demon, stole souls, and had weird
magical attacks and defenses, yeah, your legend has some truth to it,"
Raditz said dryly. "And that's not mentioning his charming
personality--an awful lot like Frieza's, only less friendly."
<p>
Master Roshi went white again, and Chi-chi nearly fainted.
<p>
"Well, for heaven's sakes, stop looking like you're about to jump out
of your skin if someone says 'boo!'" interrupted Bulma. "He's dead,
his minions are dead, and good riddance to the lot of them!"
<p>
"Dead? But how can you kill an immortal?" wondered Muten Roshi.
<p>
"First you strip him of his immortality," Raditz pointed out.
<p>
"*Ahem* I'm telling this story, Raditz! I'll let you know when it is
your turn." Bulma sounded a bit snappish.  "Anyway, it all started
when we left here two days ago..."
<p>
"It started a bit earlier than that," Raditz muttered.
<p>
Bulma stopped, glared at Raditz, and drummed her fingers, waiting.
<p>
"Sorry."
<p>
"Two days ago..." Bulma told the story{1}, with Raditz, Gohan, and
Trunks filling in their pieces of the whole. Everyone's attention was
riveted to the four of them--except for Goten, who slept cradled in his
uncle's lap. There were many unexpected revelations...
<p>
.."You mean Raditz was hanging around here as a ghost the whole time?
Man, this is nuts!"...
<p>
...
<p>
.."So it was you who ended my nightmares!" Bulma was awed.
<p>
...
<p>
.."My little Goten can see ghosts?" Chi-chi fainted...
<p>
...
<p>
.."Ox-King, you knew he was here?? Why didn't you tell me?"
<p>
"He said he was a friend of yours, Goku. I didn't know he was your
brother."
<p>
"No, I said 'I wish I had been', and 'I'd like to be'" corrected
Raditz...
<p>
...
<p>
.."Trunks kidnapped Goten and hid in the trunk of the car and you
watched the whole thing and didn't do anything about it! RADITZ!"
<p>
"I was dead at the time. The only person listening to me was Goten,
and none of you were listening to him--he's been telling you about me
for the last six weeks!"
<p>
"Raditz, I'm his mother, and I usually know what Goten is saying, but
'Nunk Rats no fun, want hair' does not obviously translate into 'Uncle
Raditz is a ghost, and I want to play with his hair'!" ...
<p>
...
<p>
.."Trunks, you killed all the ghouls by yourself, after Raditz told you
how? You are doing very well indeed--your father would be proud." Goku
beamed at his latest student.
<p>
"The only thing between my baby and dozens of hungry ghouls was a
five-year-old boy??" Chi-chi fainted again...
<p>
...
<p>
.."Raditz saved the kids, and Gohan, and Bulma from the ghost Ochimo?
We are talking about Goku's evil brother Raditz, right?" Yamcha cocked
an eyebrow in Raditz's direction.
<p>
"Could we drop the 'Goku's evil brother' prefix to my name? Unless, of
course, you need it to tell me from the other half-dozen Raditzs you know-
--then you could just shorten it to 'Goku's brother'."..
<p>
...
<p>
.."You taught the river kami SIGN LANGUAGE while I was off nearly
getting my soul eaten by the Opawang?"...
<p>
...
<p>
.."I'm afraid Raditz was right--that was a remarkably careless wish!"
Master Roshi shivered.
<p>
"Yeah, it brought him back to life," Kulilin muttered.
<p>
"KULILIN!"
<p>
"Sorry, Bulma."..
<p>
...
<p>
.."Gohan, aren't you glad I insisted that you take some extra food?"
<p>
"Well, *I* was glad of it," noted Raditz
<p>
"So was I!" added Trunks...
<p>
...
<p>
.."That monster kidnapped my baby??" Chi-chi looked faint...
<p>
...
<p>
.."TRUNKS killed the Air Ochimo? Whoa! I'm impressed!" Yamcha leaned
over and exchanged a high-five with the violet-haired lad...
<p>
...
<p>
.."You left Goten with RADITZ??"
<p>
"Mom, I couldn't very well carry him into a fight with the Opawang, and
Raditz likes him, so I figured it was okay."
<p>
"I was unconscious at the time, and didn't have much say in the
matter."..
<p>
...
<p>
.."Eeeyewww! That is one nasty attack--good thing the Opawang didn't
use it on anyone else. Bad enough he tried to kill our Bulma with it!
Raditz, I apologize for anything rude I've said to you today; some of
the things I've said were petty--and you saved Bulma's life at the
cost of your own. How'd you get back again?" Kulilin was puzzled...
<p>
...
<p>
.."A naked godd---ERRRKK!" Oolong found it hard to talk with Bulma's
hands wrapped around his throat.
<p>
"I warned you, Oolong!" Bulma snarled.
<p>
"Um, Bulma?"
<p>
"What, Yamcha?"
<p>
"You really should let Oolong go; he's turning blue."..
<p>
...
<p>
"..and then Dad and Piccolo showed up right after Raditz came back to
life, to find us all pretty much okay. Dad looked kind of surprised to
see Raditz, though." Gohan concluded.
<p>
"That isn't quite the expression I'd use--'utterly astonished' was more
like it," Goku replied.
<p>
Raditz smirked. "Heh. Not half as astonished as I was to be there,
little brother."
<p>
...
<p>
"Raditz is now Bulma's BODYGUARD? Man, this is COMPLETELY nuts!"

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Mat">V. SHAH MAT</A></H1>
<p>
The golden deer was gone. That was the first thing that Vegeta noticed
as he stepped into the black glade. The second thing he immediately
noticed was the small wooden hut (black wood, thatched with black
bark) in the center of the glade. The third thing Vegeta noticed was
the old, old man who shuffled out of the little hut and smiled at
him--like the deer, he was not black, and caught the eye.
<p>
Vegeta's eyes narrowed. The white-haired, white-bearded old man
appeared weak, no, downright feeble--but the Saiyan prince could not
sense his power. For that matter, he'd never sensed the deer's
power--something had hidden it from him. Neither the deer nor the old
man were what they seemed. Caution, then. Vegeta would observe, and
evaluate; determine what he was really dealing with, and whose side it
was on before he acted.
<p>
It was times like this he missed Nappa; the giant Saiyan had been a
useful stalking horse, letting Vegeta evaluate his enemies in action
against the elite warrior, giving him the information and time needed
to form his strategy. Well, Nappa was not with him now, nor were those
idiot friends of Kakarott's, who had served the same purpose many
times later; Vegeta would just have to unravel these unknowns on his
own. He ruthlessly suppressed his impatience and annoyance, and
approached the seeming hermit.
<p>
Before Vegeta could speak, the hermit greeted him. "Welcome, traveler!
Few come this way, and fewer still that Old Maricha wishes to meet,
but you are most welcome, noble prince!"
<p>
"What? You know of me? But how--?" In his astonishment, Prince Vegeta
quite forgot his manners and his plans.
<p>
"You were advised to seek a guide in the Dire Wood, were you not, O
Prince? What kind of guide would I be, if I did not know who and what
passed through the wood of my exile? You are the prince of an ancient
and noble race, this I can see with my own eyes; I do not know your
quest--yet--save that it bears on the fate of the Three Worlds.  But
come, I am a poor host, to leave you thus standing."  With that, the
old man stepped inside his hut, and re-appeared with two simple wooden
chairs--black, of course.
<p>
"Well, why not?" Vegeta said to himself, and took the offered
seat. The hermit came out with a small, round, black table and placed
it between the two of them. On the table the old man set an ancient,
dusty ceramic flask, and two tiny cups with no handles. Vegeta arched
his eyebrows in a silent question.
<p>
"For later," the old hermit answered. "Talking is thirsty work, when
one is as unaccustomed to it as I am.  Now, please tell me, what do
you seek, O Prince? For I cannot guide a traveler who does not know
what destination he seeks."
<p>
"This traveler," Vegeta chose his words carefully, "wishes to know
first what quality of guide he has found. I had not heard that Hell
was populated by kind and helpful.. guides." Prince Vegeta stared
cooly at the old man.
<p>
The hermit sighed. "You are wise, noble prince. We who dwell in the
Lower World have indeed earned our places here. I was once a
man-eating demon of the Middle World, who preyed on travelers and holy
hermits in an ancient forest. In death, I am cursed to be that which I
once preyed upon, and to serve those who were my victims. As I once
led a great prince astray, for my atonement I guide another prince on
his true path."
<p>
Prince Vegeta pondered this; plausible enough, and there was no trace
of that foulness, that taint of perverted reality carried by the broo
and the demon that killed him. "I seek life--for myself, and
death--for my enemy." He smiled wryly. "A simple task--except that no
one knows how my enemy might be killed--or even what my enemy IS."
<p>
The old hermit looked thoughtful. "I need to think on this, and you
must tell me of your enemy." He picked up the dusty flask and poured a
rich, golden liquor into the two cups, offering one to Vegeta. Vegeta
took it, and regarded it and the demon hermit; with a smirk, he drank
it down.
<p>
The hermit, who had started to sip his, raised an eyebrow, and quickly
tossed his down as well. He blinked rapidly, clearing his eyes from
the tears that started from them from the potent liquor. "Soma,"
Maricha said dryly, "is not really intended for chugging."
<p>
Vegeta smirked, unfazed by the potent, magical liquor. "You wished to
hear of my enemy, did you? Well..."
<p>

<p>
On Earth, the day after Bulma's late-night storytelling session,
Raditz looked for his brother Goku.  Only Bulma and Trunks and Raditz
remained with Goku's family; the others had found their way to their
respective homes, relieved indeed that everything had turned out well,
if a bit astonished at the turn of events. They had been more
accepting of Raditz than he could understand, until his brother
quietly reminded Raditz that they'd all lived through Vegeta changing
from mortal enemy to the strongest of allies--and Vegeta had been far
more feared and hated than Raditz had ever been.
<p>
He found Goku along the stream, hunting fish. "Kakarott."
<p>
"Raditz, I wish you would stop calling me that. My name is Goku." Goku
stopped searching for giant carp, and turned to face his brother as
Raditz dropped down from the sky to land beside him.
<p>
"I'm sorry, Kakarott, but I'm not ready to do that. I don't know if I
ever will be." There was a strange, haunted look in the tall Saiyan's
eyes.
<p>
"Why not?"
<p>
"Kakarott is the name of the little brother I loved, the name mother
and father gave you, on our home world. Our parents, who loved both of
us, who died with our world," and Goku could hear the grief in his
brother's voice. "Goku is the name of a Saiyan who did not know me,
who renounced his family and race, and who killed me."  He paused,
looking at the distant horizon. "I like Kakarott better."
<p>
Goku sighed. "I can accept your reasons better than I can
Vegeta's. Okay, if you would rather call me Kakarott, I won't
complain. What brings you out here? Taking up fishing?" Goku smiled.
<p>
"Not yet. Kakarott, I need to know.. how Vegeta died."
<p>
Goku turned serious. "You don't know? But you and he--"
<p>
"Vegeta didn't volunteer any information, and I was so rattled by what
he was asking of me that I didn't think to ask." Raditz seemed
embarrassed. "I did find out later that something very, very nasty
smashed its way through the Hells on its way to Earth, and from things
father said, I gathered that same thing killed Prince Vegeta. I don't
know the details, and I need to."
<p>
Goku looked sharply at Raditz. "Why?"
<p>
Raditz stared at the horizon again. "Because I need to know what to
tell Bulma about my meeting with Vegeta in Hell."
<p>
"Why not tell her the truth?" Goku frowned.
<p>
"Because Vegeta told me more than he intended to, but I need to know
what happened to make sense of it. I'm not going to pass on baseless
conjecture as fact--and Bulma is going to need to know more than what
Vegeta explicitly told me."
<p>
Raditz considered; if Kakarott kept asking questions, Raditz didn't
know how he was going to answer him--he was not comfortable with the
glimpse he'd gotten into Bulma's grief, again.
<p>
Sometime in the small hours of the morning, Raditz had gotten restless
and gone for a walk outside. He was still full of energy from his
recent resurrection, and not really in need of sleep. He'd watched the
waning crescent moon for a while, reflecting that he'd better pay
attention to the phases of Earth's moon or he'd severely embarrass
himself some night, when Raditz heard noises coming from the
house. Noises like muffled laughter, or someone choking, or
someone.. crying.
<p>
Raditz had stalked over to the open window, concerned and curious. The
noise was coming from Bulma's room; crying, and low voices. Bulma,
weeping, and Chi-chi, talking to her, trying to comfort her. He'd
started to turn away--ordinary grief wasn't something he could, or
should, protect her from--but then what she was saying had registered.
<p>
"Bulma! After you nearly got killed, you can't be serious about
searching for another wish, can you?"
<p>
"Oh, Chi-chi! You heard what Raditz said! Vegeta is in HELL! I can't
leave him there!" she sobbed bitterly, her face buried in Chi-chi's
soggy shoulder.
<p>
Chi-chi held her friend as she cried. "Bulma.." no comforting words
came to her in the face of the stark truth Bulma had
uttered. Only.. "Bulma, that wasn't all Raditz said. You said so
yourself."
<p>
"I know! I know! It didn't make any sense, but I'm afraid.." she cried
some more, "I'm afraid that Vegeta may put himself beyond the reach of
any wish, and I'll lose him.. forever. Not just until 'we meet again'
on the other side, but FOREVER." Terrible, despairing sobs racked
Bulma; Chi-chi held her, but could think of nothing comforting to say.
<p>
Raditz turned away, then, uncomfortable with what he had glimpsed. It
burdened him; he knew Bulma would be coming to him for answers soon,
answers he wasn't sure of himself. All Raditz knew was that Vegeta
would be back, one way or another--but he couldn't say why he knew
that. And until he could say why, he couldn't convince Bulma of it,
either.
<p>
"Well, Kakarott?"
<p>
Goku was thoughtful. "I learned how it started from Gohan,
afterward. You see, I've only recently returned to Earth myself."
<p>
"What??"
<p>
"You didn't know? I guess you don't get much news down there in
Hell. I did not survive the fight with Cell two years ago, and I chose
to stay in Heaven. I didn't want anyone getting hurt again, trying to
bring me back, and if someone else wanted revenge on me, well, they
already had it because I was dead, and no one I loved would have had
to get hurt again because of me."
<p>
"Oh." Raditz looked thoughtful. "Did you meet mother there?"
<p>
Goku smiled gloriously. "Yes. And you are right--she loves us both."
<p>
"So does father." Raditz smiled. "But about Vegeta..."
<p>
Goku turned serious again. "I made a mistake in assuming that all our
enemies were MY enemies.  Somehow Gohan and Vegeta made an enemy of
something horribly evil and powerful. According to Gohan.."
<p>
Goku explained to Raditz how a monstrous winged, tailed demon had
dropped howling out of the sky into the middle of downtown Satan City,
where Chi-chi and Bulma had taken Gohan and Trunks shopping for new
clothes. At first, it had seemed an evil coincidence that the demon
had attacked when they were in town, but then Gohan had attacked the
monster.
<p>
It had howled his name in triumph--"GOHAN, SON OF GOKU, DIE!",
shrugging off the young Saiyan hero's attacks as it slashed envenomed
talons at him. It knew who it was attacking, and it had come for
them. It was monstrously tough, and fast, half as large as an Ouzaru,
and seemed untiring--only as a Super-Saiyan could Gohan even hurt the
thing, and the damage to the city was horrific. City blocks smashed
into rubble, people broken and killed, and worst of all, people
mutated and twisted into demonic caricatures of themselves by the
tainted slime drooling from the demon's jaws.  Bulma's desperate call
home had summoned Vegeta, and together, the two of them had driven the
demon away from the city, away from Bulma and Chi-chi.
<p>
Away from the city, the chilling truth became obvious; the demon had
not been driven away from the city, but was pursuing Gohan, and Gohan
was tiring. The demon was also tiring, bleeding from injuries gained
fighting both Super-Saiyans, but not fast enough--not fast enough at
all, as it broke away from them and plunged through the sky to the
Capsule Corp compound where Bulma had escaped to. Perhaps it
calculated that it could not defeat both the Super-Saiyans and kill
its original targets too--whatever the reason, it left Gohan and
Vegeta distracted, fighting its creations--the demonic mutants created
by the monster's corrupting spit--just long enough for the demon to
get to its helpless targets.
<p>
Gohan could not bring himself to kill what were once innocent humans,
and was fatally delayed in bringing them down gently.  Vegeta had no
such compunctions, and ripped brutally through them to pursue the
demon. He'd pushed himself to his limits, and beyond, subjecting his
body to energies beyond his ability to endure.
<p>
He got there in time. Wracked with agony, Vegeta swept Bulma and his
son out of the way of the demon's attack, and dumped everything he had
left into one incalculably furious attack. The demon reeled, hurt,
power nearly gone--but not destroyed. Vegeta collapsed, utterly
spent. Every muscle quivered in agony, seared by the energies that had
coursed through him, energies that were completely depleted
now. Nothing left for attack, nothing left for defense. Despairing, he
watched as the wounded demon found its footing again.
<p>
Then, Goku appeared. Sent back from Heaven to fight an abomination
that had no place in either Earth or Hell, flaring golden beyond
super-saiyan, Goku stood between the demon and its prey. Gohan,
finally free of its creations, joined the battle in time to see his
father appear; beyond him, he saw the surprise, and joy, and relief
flash across Vegeta's face. He watched Vegeta glance back to where
he'd thrown Bulma and Trunks to safety, watched Vegeta's whole body
sag in weariness and relief.
<p>
Then it happened. As Goku gathered power for the final blow, the
demon's supple, deadly tail had whipped up in a great arc, over and
past the mighty Super-Saiyan to plunge down behind him--into
Vegeta. Goku severed the exposed tail, and let go his mighty
Ka-meha-meha blast into the demon. It disintegrated with a howl of
rage, but too late; a horrified Goku saw the two-meter-long poisonous
stinger impaling Vegeta from back-to-front.
<p>
There wasn't even time for final farewells; the demon's venom killed
Vegeta as Goku dropped to his fallen comrade's side. They later
learned how unbelievably potent it was--a hundredth of a drop could
kill the mightiest Saiyan warrior in a heartbeat. The stinger impaling
Vegeta's heart had delivered far, far more than a drop of the deadly
nerve poison.
<p>
"..I removed the stinger telekinetically, and destroyed the thing, and
all traces of that venom, but too late. Vegeta was dead. I think that
was the hardest part for Bulma, for all of us--that we didn't even
have a chance to say goodbye.  We buried his body in a private place,
up on the mountain behind our house," Goku finished the somber tale.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"..and that is what I fought, and what killed me," Vegeta
concluded. "And I know what the others do not--the demon's physical
form was only dispersed by Kakarott's attack. It can, and will, reform
its physical body when it recovers enough energy--that is why it came
after my soul.  I need to find a more permanent way to stop it, and I
think that to do that, I must know WHY it came after me and my family,
and WHAT it is."  Vegeta was on his third or fourth glass of Soma, and
his usual cold reserve had thawed considerably.
<p>
"I see. I need to think more on the matter, but I suspect that for
now, one path will lead you toward both your goals." The hermit capped
the bottle of Soma, and put it aside. "In time, you will find that
your goals seem to take divergent paths, but there will be a
path--roundabout, perhaps--that takes you true to where you must go."
<p>
"And that path is?"
<p>
"Some thought is needed. An enlightening diversion to clear the Soma
clouds from one's mind. A game, I think, between you and me--a simple
game to entertain an old hermit, a game played by kings." Maricha
smiled, and reached into his hut for an ornate wooden box.
<p>
"A game? Feh. I have no interest in games! Tell me my path, and I'll
be on my way!" Vegeta's eyebrows arched down, betraying his
irritation.
<p>
"Patience, noble prince. If you dislike games--you think them things
for children, do you not?--call it 'an intellectual exercise in
abstracted warfare'. This 'exercise' was once the perogative of kings
and noble warriors alone," the hermit Maricha said, as he opened the
box to reveal a black and white checkered eight-by-eight board and two
sets of playing pieces--one black, one white. "The moves are simple,
and easy to learn, and yet geniuses spend a lifetime truly mastering
the 'exercise'." He began to set up the pieces, thirty-two
beautifully-carved statuettes of demons and warriors, princes and
princesses, heroes and villains. "You see, noble prince, the play is
your strategy against your opponent's--there is no element of chance
in this 'exercise'. Only your cleverness against mine, Prince Vegeta."
<p>
Vegeta's eyes widened as the hermit's shot struck home. "Is that so?
Show me these simple moves, then! I will play your game, and we will
find out how clever you really are, demon-hermit-guide Maricha!"
<p>
"The game has had many names through the ages, but modern players call
it 'Chess'. This piece, the king, is victory or defeat for you, though
he himself has little power..."  Maricha explained each of the pieces
and their moves, powers and limitations with the same flowery
language. He quickly summed up the rules for turns, special moves and
victory; Vegeta was a astute listener, and never needed to be told
twice.
<p>
Maricha courteously offered Vegeta play of the white side, which goes
first and is considered to have a slight advantage thereby; Vegeta
declined. He preferred to watch his opponent make the first move
before deciding on a response. Their game began.
<p>
At first, Maricha's experience told in his favor; Vegeta frowned as he
lost several pawns and a bishop to the old hermit's attacks. He began
to see the pattern of the board, the pieces, their spheres of power
and movement--like himself, and his various attacks and powers, Vegeta
thought. Each piece an attack or a defense, used against his
opponent's defenses and attacks, until the vital core, the King, was
exposed...
<p>
"You are correct, Maricha. It is an interesting.. game."  He raised his
eyes from the board to look at Maricha. "Have you thought on my path,
yet?"
<p>
"Yes, I have," the old demon-hermit said. "Under the city of Hidden
Lankha lies the Treasury of the Rakshasas, wherein is stored all
manner of ancient lore and magic. My nephew is King of Hidden Lankha,
and will welcome you, O Prince, for sake of thy eldest ancestor. Go to
him, and tell him what you have told me, and he will know where to
find lore of your enemy, and the path back to the living as well."
<p>
Maricha moved one of his bishops. "Indeed, Hidden Lankha is part of
the Middle World, though set apart from it by illusion and myth, and
therein lies a problem."
<p>
"What, besides the fact I am dead and down here in Hell?" Vegeta's
brows arched downward, betraying his irritation as he reached for a
pawn.
<p>
"That is exactly the problem. From our hidden refuges in the Lower
World to Hidden Lankha there is a passage, one I can guide you to
quite easily--but it is guarded. He who guards it stops any
undeserving souls from passing from the Lower World to the Middle
World or the Upper World. Only good deeds done in life may shield a
man from him.." The hermit moved another pawn to counter Vegeta's
move.
<p>
Vegeta reflected. "That.. could be a problem," he said wryly.
<p>
"If you may not pass him with the shield of Dharma, you will simply
have to defeat him. He is a demon, a Rakshasa like myself, and not a
god; he was defeated once before, which is why he is dead and guarding
the other worlds from the Lower World, and not ravening across the
Middle World."  Maricha's manner seemed less confident than his words
as he chose which piece to play this turn.
<p>
By this point in the game, Vegeta began to realize that Maricha was
very conservative, almost timid in the way he deployed his
pieces. Each piece carefully supporting the other, attacks that were
hesitant, risking nothing--and gaining little in return.  Vegeta
smirked.
<p>
"No one ever won a combat with timidity, Maricha!" Vegeta's queen
slashed across the board, capturing the hermit's rook and putting his
king in check.
<p>
"That is true," the old hermit-demon allowed. "However, the foolish
oft rush boldly into traps. Prince Vegeta, are you familiar with the
concept of a 'fork'?"  Maricha's knight jumped into position, breaking
the check.
<p>
Vegeta stared at the board, heart sinking. On the one hand, his rook
was threatened; on the other hand, his remaining bishop. He could only
protect one; the other piece was doomed.  The vein on his forehead
stood out as Vegeta berated himself silently. Vegeta, you idiot! All
those 'timid' moves of his--he was setting you up for this trap! His
exposed king--a feint, to lure me out of position! If this had been a
real combat, I'd be digging myself out of the nearest chunk of
landscape, spitting out blood and seriously down on power, if not on
the verge of being killed!  Hmmm.. Can I salvage this situation?
<p>
Prince Vegeta studied the board, and finally saw the rest of the trap
he'd fallen into. No matter which piece he saved, Maricha's next move
would threaten his king--and Vegeta saw no way out. Vegeta, you are an
even bigger fool than you thought! I've mistaken careful coordination
of forces for timidity, and foolishly tried to carry this 'game' on
sheer boldness and improvisation--which works fine in the usual total
chaos of my battles.. but this is different. Both of us know what the
other's capabilities are, and where they are--no surprises, except in
how we choose to use them. Against an iron-nerved strategist--one who
plans carefully, always adapting to the circumstance and who cannot be
panicked into doing something stupid.. it takes more than boldness. I
should have known better--I do know better!
<p>
Vegeta played the last, inevitable moves, and watched coldly as
Maricha tipped his king over--"Shah Mat!"--the king is dead!
<p>
Vegeta watched as Maricha put the pieces away. The old hermit uncapped
the bottle of Soma and poured some more for each of them. Vegeta
snarled, "Yes, a very interesting.. game! And, it has cleared more
than Soma clouds from my head. I think we shall play again. I insist
on it!" His brows arched down with barely suppressed rage, and the
vein on his forehead stood out.
<p>
Maricha gulped nervously. "Drink. You must rest first, and one other
thing.." He frowned. A great sleepiness came on Vegeta as he drank the
last cup of soma, and he seemed to hear Old Maricha as if from a great
distance, saying, "You've lost your tail. Let me see if I can fix
that," and then he slept...
<p>
<p><I>He dreamed that he was a small white monkey, looking up as a
flying chariot crested the wall of Lankha. In it rode a powerful black
demon prince, and he held a beautiful golden-skinned princess by the
hair. The white monkey recognized the princess Sita, and called out to
the demon, "What are you doing?"
</I></p>
<p><I>
The demon prince answered, "I would do anything to give you pain!" He
smiled and raised his sword. A scream cut the air, and the demon cut
Sita apart; he struck her left shoulder while he held her hair and cut
down across her body, carving her in two along the line of the sacred
thread lying across her breast, and half her body fell to the chariot
floor.
</I></p>
<p><I>
The white monkey tried to find Prince Rama; he met Jambavan the Bear
and Lakshmana together, and rubbing tears from his eyes he said,
"Indrajit killed Sita!"
</I></p>
<p><I>
Lakshmana was speechless. Jambavan said, "That ends the war; Rama will
die."
</I></p>
<p><I>
Out of nowhere, Vibhishana the Rakshasa, tall, black-skinned and blue
haired appeared beside them--"Hanuman, what is this?"
</I></p>
<p><I>
The white monkey told him, and Vibhishana said, "That was an
illusion!"
</I></p>
<p><I>
"Oh no, I saw it, it was real!" cried the white monkey.
</I></p>
<p><I>
"It was false!" Vibhishana grimaced and his face shattered and fell in
pieces at his feet. His sapphire-blue eyes broke like glass and were
gone. He looked at the white monkey with empty eye-sockets in a
horrible scar-covered skull. "Monkey, thus are you blind!"
</I></p>
<p><I>
Vibhishana's eyes and face reformed, and he said, "Take my word, it
never happened. Do not grieve and please your enemies."
</I></p>

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Vegeta started awake. This was impossible! He was dead! The dead do
not sleep, nor do they dream. He blinked, and looked around. The glade
was empty--no hut, no deer, and no game-playing hermit.  Illusion..
Treacherous demon! No--the rakshasa had not played him false, even if
the coward had run from the challenge of a second game. He knew, as if
Maricha had whispered it to him while he slept, the path to Hidden
Lankha from these woods.
<p>
Prince Vegeta rose to his feet, and staggered, off-balance. WHAT THE
HELL? Something felt odd. Something felt.. right. Vegeta's eyes
widened in amazement as he felt something he'd missed for a very long
time. He looked down and over his shoulder.. at his tail!
<p>
It wasn't exactly HIS tail; this new tail was white, except for the
very tip, which was dusted black as if he'd dipped the tip in soot. It
felt right, though, as he switched it from side to side, and finally
curled it around his waist, where it belonged.
<p>
"So, someone thinks I need a tail. Does it work like the old one, I
wonder?" Vegeta hesitated to try it, and yet it seemed unwise to wait
until he needed it to find out that he might not be able to transform
after all.
<p>
On the other hand.. it would save him some travel time across the Dire
Wood. Vegeta cupped his hand, and summoned the energies of lunar light,
then flung his artificial moon into the non-sky of Hell.
<p>
"I wonder," he thought, tingling with the energy of impending
transformation, "can Bulma play chess?"
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Two figures watched the great ouzaru wade through the Dire Wood,
snapping off black trees and tossing them aside as if they were so
many twigs.
<p>
"Can he hope to win?" asked the one to the other, who was Maricha the
Rakshasa Hermit.
<p>
"Against any other.. no question. But against your brother's son--who
has such power?" Maricha sounded doubtful.
<p>
"He has the power; in all the ages of the world, I have seen only two
mightier." The other was more confident.
<p>
"If you say so.." Old Maricha was still doubtful.  "But he is too
eager to believe every illusion spun about him."
<p>
The tall rakshasa with dark blue hair and clear sapphire-blue eyes
smiled wickedly, showing long fangs and sharp teeth. "Perhaps it is as
you say, and all hopes and dreams will fall before Indrajit's deadly
arrows. Or perhaps he is wiser than you know...  Vegeta's fate is his
own to make."

<CENTER><P>CONTINUED IN CHAPTER VI. THE INVISIBLE DEMON</P></CENTER>

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Demon">VI. THE INVISIBLE DEMON</A></H1>
<p>
<p><I>
"Oh Man, I am the demon warrior Indrajit, hard to see.<BR>
I fight invisibly, hidden by enchantment from your sight.<BR>
I attack behind the wild winds of evil thought;<BR>
I put out many lights left unguarded.<BR>
I know you, and good deeds done in life are your only shield when you<BR>
who have died must go alone past me to another world.<BR>
You may hide at night from the Sun, but never from your own<BR>
heart--where lives Lord Narayana."
</I></p>
<p>
The challenge echoed from tree to tree of the pale wood, but Prince
Vegeta could see no sign of the challenger. The corner of his mouth
quirked up in a cold half-smile.
<p>
"Well, he did say he was hard to see," Vegeta wryly told himself. If
Maricha had not lied, the path to Hidden Lankha continued beyond the
pale wood, beyond the river cutting through it.  Of course, if Maricha had
lied.. Vegeta smiled evilly, and his thoughts were very dark.
<p>
Vegeta had had to resume normal size after leaving the Dire Wood; his
path followed dark caves and tunnels once again. Serpentine things
slithered back into darkness as he passed, only to re-gather behind
him. Whatever they were, they avoided him, and Vegeta ignored them in
turn.
<p>
In truth, though it had been refreshing to become ouzaru once more,
Vegeta found that he did not miss it when he became man again. His
power had grown so much over the years since he'd lost his tail that
the ouzaru's size and rage no longer gave the advantage over his
normal form that it once had. It just made him a larger target--though
it might be very useful in fighting another gigantic enemy like that
damn demon!
<p>
From the caves he'd emerged into another spectral forest--this one of
white trees, pale moss, white marble rocks, and pale ashy soil. What
was it with these forests? Would the next one be grey, or some bright
color?  Feh. Somewhere in this wood was supposed to be the guardian
Vegeta must pass--and now his voice echoed all around.
<p>
Vegeta lept forward, landing in combat stance with a tree protecting
his flank. His eyes flicked from side to side as Vegeta scanned the
pale trees, trying to sense something of his opponent. Nothing. If
Indrajit was more than a voice, he was indeed hidden and invisible.
<p>
<p><I>
"Oh Man, your deeds are dark with blood and rage,<BR>
no shield for you, but instead a stain.<BR>
Fragile fluttering candle, I am the dark wind extinguishing you!"
</I></p>
<p>
The air slashed him; Vegeta was flung hard against a tree by the blow,
snapping the mighty trunk in two. A great cut split his torso armor
open, and a thin line of blood stretched across his chest from right
shoulder to left hip. Only instinct allowed him to block the second
stroke aimed at his neck--there was a chunk! of something hard biting
into wood beside him, and the stub of the tree shattered.
<p>
"I can't sense his power at all!" Vegeta dodged without thought and
something whipped past his cheek to embed itself into the boulders behind
him. Vegeta glanced down; a black steel arrow still quivered, embedded
nearly to the fletching in the rock. Thunk! Another one buried itself
in Vegeta's shoulder. Just in time, he felt the passage of two more
arrows, and dodged them.
<p>
He grimaced in pain. Arrows? This demon was using ARROWS? This was
impossible; no saiyan was so weak as to be hurt by simple ballistic
projectiles! How could he be hurting?  Unless...
<p>
<p><I>
"Oh Man, feel the bite of my black arrows,<BR>
feel the bite of my power!<BR>
Feel the touch of my blade,<BR>
feel the touch of my hunger!"
</I></p>
<p>
With  one  sudden motion,  Vegeta  yanked  the  black arrow  from  his
shoulder.  It vanished  as  soon as  he  drew it  out.  Vegeta's  eyes
narrowed. So;  not a real arrow,  but the outward form  of the demon's
own powerful attack! He dodged, for no better reason than a hunch he'd
been standing still too long.
<p>
Steel shrieked again as something tore chunks from the rocks behind
him. Too close! And then the return stroke caught him, a brutal punch
across Vegeta's face with a taloned hand. Blood ran from three parallel
cuts across his cheek--and the saiyan struck back! A flurry of blows
traded with something unseen, yet powerful--only one struck home, and
that one did not land with any force, yet the invisible demon broke
off, retreated beyond Vegeta's reach.
<p>
Black steel arrows sleeted down on Vegeta, and it was his turn to
retreat, twisting and turning through the trees that blocked
Indrajit's arrows. Every now and then one found its way through, and
Vegeta gasped in pain. He paused, and dodged away again; upward he
flew, above the trees. He turned, and blasted downwards.
<p>
Nine explosive blasts in a ring about him, searing white trees into
black dust, heaving up great clouds of the black ash. All around Vegeta
the air was filled with smoke and ash; nothing could be seen more than
a few meters away. The warrior prince stopped to check his handiwork.
<p>
He's powerful, I'll give him that, Vegeta thought. Fast, and knows how
to fight. Invisible, and hard to hit because of it--a dangerous
opponent. Can he sense me in all this smoke?
<p>
<p><I>
"Oh Man, you think to hide from Indrajit?<BR>
You still cannot hide from your own heart,<BR>
and your black deeds call out to me!"
</I></p>
<p>
The blow caught Vegeta low in the back, and flung him down, towards
the ground. Barely he recovered control, and flipped to touch down and
bounce aloft again. He can sense me! This is bad.
<p>
Twice, thrice more Vegeta retreated through the trees as Indrajit's
steel rain assailed him. He did not always dodge quickly enough, and
the wounds were adding up. Twice and thrice Vegeta blasted away the
trees surrounding him, but with no sign that he'd hit anything. He
paused between attacks, shaking with exertion. Too much! He'd never
defeat the demon this way--he needed a plan.
<p>
Baka! The Saiyan prince berated himself. Vegeta, didn't you learn
anything from that 'game' of Maricha's?  This demon, Indrajit--he has
nerve, and he thinks he knows my powers, now. I can guess at his--he
is vulnerable to me, if I can land a blow on him, or he wouldn't have
run when we mixed it up hand-to-hand. Invisible.. I can't see him to
hit him, so I have to know where he is some other way--yes!
<p>
Again, Vegeta dashed high into the air, blasting away the spectral
forest in a ring around him. He left a small grove of trees standing
in the middle, and darted back into the shelter of the tiny wood just
ahead of Indrajit's arrows. A rapid barrage of ki blasts annihilated
the incoming arrows, followed by two larger blasts volleyed into the
air to explode across the sky.
<p>
He won't be hanging in the sky to shoot at me, now. Vegeta smiled
evilly; with these trees, he has to get in close... and once he does,
I'll know where he is!
<p>
Everything grew still. Vegeta flitted from tree to tree, listening,
waiting for his opponent. Nerves taut, anticipating the attack that
was long in coming.  So, he thinks he can outwait me? I planned for
that, too!
<p>
A sudden burst of speed, another flurry of arrows dodged, another sky
blast, and Vegeta once again waited for Indrajit's attack--in another
tiny grove of trees left standing from a previous round of blasts, a
grove still closer to river and the boundry Indrajit could not let him
pass.  Vegeta smirked to himself. Yes.. he can either attack me at MY
choosing, or he can fail in his duty and let me pass him by. Which
will he do?
<p>
Still Indrajit avoided him, save for the occasional arrow. At last,
Vegeta looked upon the river--steaming cold water in its bed of white
marble pebbles, transparent as glass. Of course; he means to stop me
as I cross the river. His mistake.  Vegeta dove into the river.
<p>
Black arrows slammed angrily into the river bank behind him, but too
late. The Saiyan prince was already at the bottom of the river, easily
dodging the arrows falling like pebbles slowly through the water. Now,
will he come in after me, or wait until I emerge? Vegeta swam along
the river until he came to a deep still pool where white-leaved trees
overhung the water on both sides. He turned, facing upward, looking
up through the water.  No more black arrows fell from the air; the
trees crowded too closely together.  He's waiting for me to come out;
he'll attack me as I emerge on the far bank.  Vegeta smiled.
<p>
The surface of the water shimmered above him, and it seemed to Vegeta
that he saw as if from the bottom of another stream, the stream near
Kakarott's house.  On the banks of that stream, Bulma knelt,
weeping. Her eyes were red, and her hair dishelved, and face drawn, as
from long grief. A dark fear crept into Prince Vegeta's heart as she
took off her shoes and jewelry and watch with an odd calmness, a
strange fixed determination in her manner as she stood on the bank, a
heartbeat from plunging into the water. Death was in her eyes...
<p>
Vegeta surged from the bottom--and stopped abruptly. No! That was not the
Bulma he knew! Memory of things said raced through his mind...
<p>
<p><I>"I attack behind the wild winds of evil thought.."
"I would do anything to give you pain!.."
Vibhishana said, "Take my word, it never happened. Do not grieve and
please your enemies..."
</I></p>
<p>
INDRAJIT! DAMN YOU! Vegeta raged. The water boiled, and Vegeta
exploded from the water blazing with power--Indrajit attacked!

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Bulma stretched as she awoke from her nap. Goodness! Three o'clock in
the afternoon, and here she was, snoozing! This wasn't a vacation, it
was pure decadence, she thought sternly to herself. You're getting
lazy, Bulma-girl!  Time to get back to work! It's getting high
time to go back home. Besides, she reflected, in less than a month it
would be time for Trunks to start school. Better if he were settled in
back home, first.
<p>
With that thought in mind, she wandered outside, looking for Trunks
and Raditz--and stopped to stare at the scene in the front yard.
<p>
"Raditz, what are you doing with my car??"
<p>
Raditz glanced at Bulma; he had the aircar standing on edge, and was
hefting it in both hands. "Getting an idea of how massive it is." He
set the car down on its skids. "I've been meaning to ask you--how do
you get these things into those little capsules?"
<p>
"Ummm.." Bulma blinked.
<p>
"The thing I can't figure out is what do you do with the excess mass?
Those capsules do not weigh what this car does, or you couldn't carry
them. I thought maybe the car was made of some hyper-strong,
super-light material, like saiyan armor, but no, it's got a
respectable mass to it. Where does the mass go, or come from?"
<p>
"Ah! That is a very good question, Raditz, and the answer to it was
the key to, well, Capsule Corporation and the Brief's family
fortune. Not to mention solving the problem of getting a good parking
space no matter how busy the mall is!" Bulma smiled, and fairly
bounced as she walked, and talked.
<p>
Raditz followed, and listened attentively as Bulma explained the basic
theory behind the encapsulatization process, and bounced around the
Son homestead, packing.
<p>
"Trunks, get your stuff! We're going home as soon as we pack and say
goodbye to everyone! Anyway, after Daddy solved the basic problem of
isolating the hyperspatial pocket from its substrate continuum...
Raditz, don't you need to pack anything?"
<p>
"Um, not really. Hmmm.. there is one thing. Wait."  Raditz went to the
small bedroom set aside for him, and dug out his broken armor. Yes,
Bulma would definitely be able to make use of it. He emerged from the
room carrying the shattered armor.  Bulma frowned as Raditz tossed it on
the dining room table.
<p>
"I don't think that armor is good for much anymore, Raditz."
<p>
He smirked at her. "You'd be surprised. Ever find that scouter?"
Raditz felt around the inside of the armor, just above the large
circular hole in the chest piece. "Yep, there it is!" Something
clicked, and he pulled out a small packet wrapped in silvery film.
<p>
Bulma raised an eyebrow. "What is that?" She leaned over to look,
curious.
<p>
Raditz grinned as he opened the packet, pulling out two strings of
small silver disks, each no larger than a quarter. "Still intact, too!
Good! They're Saiyan tech manuals, Bulma. Get that scouter, and
there's a reader in it, just behind the main control button. Even if
you fried the power-detection circuitry, you should be able to take
out the reader and hook it to one of your computers."
<p>
"Tech manuals?" Bulma's eyes gleamed with excitement. "Tech manuals
for what, exactly?"
<p>
"Well, well, I had that one after all." He flicked a disk. "Scouters,
for one thing. Armor repair and maintenance, space pod maintenance AND
flight operations, starship and starbase life support systems, all
kinds of odd things. Heh."
<p>
Bulma looked like a kid who's just been turned loose in a toy store
with an Iridium credit card. She tried to keep her voice steady, and
barely restrained herself from snatching up the disks and hugging them
to herself. "How come--Why do you have all this?"
<p>
"Had a bad experience once; got stranded on a deserted base with a
busted space pod, and no idea how to fix the damn thing! Barely
managed to figure out how to bring up the station's life systems
before I ran out of air--it was a vacuum moon--and then I had to muck
about for manuals and tools to fix the stupid pod. That wouldn't have
been so bad, but the large antisocial reason that the station was
deserted was trying to eat me at the time.  I've been a bit paranoid
ever since about trusting my life to equipment I can't fix."
<p>
"Well, I can certainly understand that!" Bulma agreed. She remembered
how utterly demoralized she had been when HER spaceship had been
destroyed on Namek. Everything she'd brought to Namek except her
clothes had eventually been destroyed; she'd never felt so helpless in
her life.  Without tools, without something to work with, she'd been
not much more than a frightened rabbit cowering from terrifying noises
and fearsome creatures.  She'd hated that feeling more than anything
else. And then there was that loathsome frog...
<p>
"Thank you, Raditz," she said thoughtfully.
<p>
He smiled, not saying a word. Damn, but she's beautiful! Brilliant,
too. I am starting to understand why Prince Vegeta chose her...
<p>
Or did she choose him?

In the borderlands between life and death, spirit and world, a
foulness lurked. It had used the time spent waiting for the last one
to return, used it well. The gifts of Chaos were powerful, but ever
fickle and random. Some were less useful than others--and It knew what
It wanted, what It needed to defeat the Saiyajin. It would disperse
Itself and re-manifest, again and again and again, until It shaped
Itself as It desired. Time was on Its side; sooner or later, It would
suceed, and It cared not for Time--had It not defied Time when It
broke violently into Time from the Chaos Before Time?
<p>
One of the gifts of Chaos is heightened intelligence. It manifested
Itself with an unexpected, yet welcome keeness of perception, and
alacrity of thought. So. The last one had returned to the world; all
was ready for the curse to be fulfilled--all except Itself. It was not
ready; It had not the necessary combination of gifts yet. Worse, with
Its new cunning, It remembered that one of the more backhanded "gifts"
of Chaos is diminished intelligence and increased impatience. Woe to
It if It should manifest too stupid to know that It was not ready yet,
and rushed off to be defeated by the Saiyajin.
<p>
It stayed in the world for a time, curled up dragon-fashion with Its
great tail wrapped around Itself, contemplating the problem. At last,
a solution presented itself! It arose.
<p>
There was a hideous twisting and tearing of chaotic flesh; with a
final howl of pain, It tore a piece of Itself away, a piece that
formed itself into a smaller copy of It, perhaps a quarter the size of
the original. It instructed Its smaller self, "You are Deputy, because
I have made you my deputy self; your task is to keep watch, and use
Our keen mind to discern when I am ready to accomplish our task, and
by My Name command Me to cease and re-form if I rush to do battle
before I am ready."
<p>
Deputy nodded; being of one mind until this moment with his greater
self, he knew what the problem was, and what had to be done. Satisfied
that the dilemma had been dealt with, the greater being dispersed its
material form, and started to re-manifest yet again.

<p>
Countless miles away, Goku woke suddenly, gasping. He sat up abruptly,
disturbing his wife's sleep.
<p>
"Goku, honey, what is it?" she queried sleepily.
<p>
Cold sweat beaded on Goku's forehead; something hideously evil and
powerful was out there! But no--as he reached out with his senses, it
vanished again.
<p>
"I don't know. For a moment, I thought--no. Nothing there. It must
have been a nightmare.  Go back to sleep, Chi-chi."
<p>
She murmured and fell asleep again, leaving the mighty Saiyan awake,
wondering if it really had been only a nightmare.
<p>
Miles away, in another direction, his older brother awoke, the
awareness of danger prickling along his spine.  Raditz threw on some
clothes and prowled about, uneasy, his tail lashing from side to side.
The young prince and Bulma slept soundly; there was nothing
threatening within the Capsule Corp. compound.  No, thought Raditz as
he looked at the cold uncaring stars, it's far away, whatever it
is--and it's waiting. But for what?

<p>
In Hell, Vegeta fought his own nightmares...
<p>
Indrajit attacked! The Saiyan blocked the expected attack, and
followed up with his own barrage of ki blasts, interweaving and
twisting, forcing the invisible demon to dodge in a dance of Vegeta's
design. Twice more, Vegeta felt the demon's slashing blows, blows that
made him smile as he bled from them.  He knew where Indrajit was!
<p>
"HAIIIIIIIII!" Prince Vegeta's hair blazed golden as he answered with
one titanic blast!  Trees shattered and disintegrated, the river
boiled away in a 50-meter stretch, the very rocks softened, melted,
and ran like water. In the center of it all, a dark form was
silhouetted, frayed, and disintegrated.
<p>
Billowing ash and smoke finally settled, and Vegeta laughed cruelly as
he reverted to his normal form. "Farewell, Indrajit! It seems they
will need another guardian for this realm!" He turned, and flew over
the charred ruins of the remaining wood.

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Something nagged at Vegeta's mind as he passed over the last smoking
stumps and started to settle before the carved archway leading into
the secret caves below Hidden Lankha. He remembered how Maricha had
used his exposed king as a feint, to lure him into a trap.. and a
dream of illusion.. But he had seen Indrajit's destruction in his
blast--
<p>
"Monkey, thus are you blind!" Vegeta swore at himself, and blazed
golden once again. He whirled, ducked, and parried the invisible blade
that drove for his heart, the core of his spirit--a blow that would
have broken him, leaving Vegeta powerless and empty, drifting forever
in Hell. The sheer force of Vegeta's barehanded parry ripped the blade
from Indrajit's hand and flung it in shattered pieces across the
forest.
<p>
With one hand Vegeta seized the wielder's unseen arm, and thrust his
other hand against the invisible demon's chest, cutting loose with a
rapid barrage of ki blasts.  He felt his enemy's body buck and shudder
under the force of his blasts, and finally go limp; Vegeta flung the
broken demon to the ground, no longer invisible. He noted without
surprise that the archway had vanished as if it had never been there
in the first place.
<p>
Indrajit had not been pretty before Vegeta's attacks, but now he was a
charred and smoking ruin of a creature. Vegeta marveled; he HAD hit
him with his great blast at the river, but the monster had
survived--until now. "Tough demon."
<p>
"Indeed," agreed Indrajit. Vegeta turned white with shock. The charred
raw skull lifted slightly to regard him with empty eye sockets.  "Of
all Rakshasa kind, only my father Ravanna was stronger than I. You
looked surprised, o man! Have you forgotten where you are?  You cannot
kill the dead."  Indrajit chuckled.
<p>
Prince Vegeta gathered power in one hand. "I can make you wish you
could die!"
<p>
Indrajit laughed hollowly. "No need; you have defeated me in
combat. I must surrender to you--but answer me this: who are you, O
man?  Only one human ever defeated me, and that was Lakshmana the
brother of Rama, who was Rama's shadow and second self. How could
another such human be born--and one so dark in deed--and not be known
across all the Three Worlds?"
<p>
Vegeta laughed.  "Human?? I am no human, I am a Saiyan warrior; I am
the Prince of the Saiyajin!" He uncurled his white tail and switched
it from side to side for emphasis.
<p>
Empty sockets turned to regard Vegeta's tail.  Indrajit laughed his
corpse-laugh. "Fool that I am, not to have known you, Child of
Hanuman! I, the invisible warrior, have been blind!"
<p>
"Child of Hanuman? What?? Either you are mad, or-- Demon, explain
yourself!"
<p>
Indrajit growled and raised himself on one skeletal arm. "Saiyan, born
under a distant star, yet ignorant of your own ancestry! So does the
past become illusion, and all histories are lies told by
scholarly fools. The blood of the Son of the Wind runs in your veins, and
his spirit fires your soul, tailed one! I can see it, taste it in your
heart!"
<p>
"That little white monkey? You dare mock me--"
<p>
"Fool. You are blinded by the world's illusions!" The charred demon
flung up one arm, and the image of a white monkey with a black-tipped
tail appeared. "Thus you think of Hanuman! Even in that form, he is a
fearsome warrior--but behold his other form--one I think you will
recognize, Saiyan!"
<p>
Indrajit clicked his blackened claws together, and another image
replaced that of the small white monkey. Night, and a full moon shone
upon the gates of a beautiful city; night, and a monstrous white
ouzarou smashed those gates to splinters. Armored black rakshashas
swarmed around him, firing arrows and bravely attacking. Vegeta could
hear the great ape bellow his rage as he ripped up an iron gatepost
bigger than a tree, and fell upon the rakshasa soldiers. Demon blood
ran through the streets in an obscene river as the white ouzaru with
the black-tipped tail crushed them or plucked them up and tore them to
pieces.
<p>
"Eighty-thousand elite rakshasa warriors, the royal guard of Lankha,
died that night. Three of our greatest champions challenged him, and
died. I stopped his rampage, but at the cost of a magic that cannot be
recalled once used, and still he escaped. Yes, THAT little white
monkey!"  Indrajit laughed mockingly, and dispelled the illusion.
<p>
"You should not have defeated me--thy dark heart should have betrayed
you. Now I understand--four golden threads light your darkness. Hold
on to them, Prince of the Saiyajin! You have ever been your own worst
enemy--beware, lest darkness within betray you to darkness without!"
<p>
Indrajit faded from sight, his final warning echoing in the still
air. The way was open.

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Thus it was that Vegeta, Prince of the Saiyajin, came to Beautiful
Lankha, the hidden city of the Rakshasas. Hidden from the world by
illusion and myth, but itself no illusion; the beautiful masterwork of
Viswakarman, the Architect of Heaven. Even the meanest houses of
commoners were built of gleaming alabaster stone, and how can one
describe the palace to eyes that have not seen its glory?  A lesser
wall made of sixteen colors of rose gold enclosed the palaces of the
king. Spired domes of gold, covered in costly gems and starred with
diamonds, a mansion only different from the best one in heaven in that
it touched the Earth of Lankha.
<p>
Illusion clad the inhabitants of Lankha, the Rakshasas. Some made
themselves beautiful beyond mortal ken, glamourous fey whose beauty is
a deadly snare, others were maimed and deformed, repulsive and
frightful even in their splendid clothes.  Some were black, some pink,
some ghastly pale; others took the form of fantastic
beastmen--gleaming men with golden leopard's heads, impossibly
jewelled unicorns, other things less probable.. but no bears, monkeys,
nor serpents. The rakshasas disdained to pose as Naga-kind, and found
no pleasure in assuming the forms of those who had defeated them so
bitterly in the long-ago.
<p>
Over all this beautiful city and her fierce eldritch people ruled the
Rakshasa king, Vibishana the Good Demon, youngest brother of Ravana.
The tall Rakshasa King stood at a wide window overlooking the city. A
wind blew off the ocean, ruffling his dark blue hair and causing his
red velvet cloak to flutter behind him.  Sapphire-blue eyes set in a
face the color of night watched the newest traveller to walk the
streets of Lankha. He turned to his guards.
<p>
"He is here; let us go down and welcome our guest." King Vibishana
smiled, revealing long fangs and a carnivore's sharp teeth. In spite
of, or perhaps because of his fearsome appearance, he was inhumanly
handsome.
<p>
The king glanced out the window again, his supernatural sight picking
out the ghostly Saiyan prince. "You've come a long way, Prince
Vegeta, and your journey is not yet done. On you is the burden of
Fate: will it be in vain?"

<CENTER><P>CONTINUED IN CHAPTER VII. CITY OF ILLUSION</P></CENTER>

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="City">VII. CITY OF ILLUSION</A></H1>
<p>
Prince Vegeta felt the subtle change even as he passed the archway and
left the pale wood. It was an awareness of both himself and the world
around him as less substantial, less real.  He'd left the
underworld, and was once again a ghost in the world of the
living. Vegeta scowled; the dead rakshasas had not lied about the path
leading to the "Middle World", but he did not like becoming an
insubstantial spirit again.  At least in the underworld, everything
else was spirit, too, and as substantial or insubstantial as
himself--and he could deal with things as if they were real.
<p>
In Lankha, Beautiful Lankha, he walked, an invisible shadow of
himself. Saiyan eyes gazed on forms both beautiful and horrid, dressed
in the garb of all tribes and nations. The rakshasas that disturbed
Vegeta the most weren't the snarling beastmen, nor the hideously
deformed black dwarfs in skins and feathers--it was the handsome,
youthful demon lads wearing jeans and T-shirts with commonplace logos
like one might see in any big city of Earth.  Vegeta gasped involuntarily
the first time a car marked with the unmistakable Capsule Corp. logo
nosed through the crowd on a main avenue. These creatures traded with
the outer world--how many of them were out there, on Earth, and who
were they?  Cloaked in illusion, masters of deception, who would ever
know?
<p>
It slowly dawned on Vegeta that the rakshasas and their cars,
bicycles, and rickshaws had not run into him, or through him yet--and
as he looked more closely at passers-by, he noticed many curious looks
in his direction. Subtle; none were so rude or so bold as to stare
directly at him, but THEY SAW HIM!  The hair on the back of his neck
prickled; Vegeta was getting very tired of Rakshasa deceptions. He was
not a pawn to be played in someone else's chess game! Anger boiled not
far beneath the surface; he desperately wanted a definite enemy to
fight.
<p>
Vegeta turned, snarling, with the intent of flying to the spired
palace that dominated the city--and stopped. A fantastic
chariot--silver-chased, and pulled by two growling tigers--had pulled
up before him.  Four powerfully-built Rakshasa guards dismounted and
knelt before him.  A proud young Rakshasa dressed in an ornate
bejewelled silk coat, turban, and pants also dismounted from the
chariot and bowed to him.  Another Rakshasa, an exquisitely beautiful
demon-maiden with brilliant orange hair and black skin remained in the
chariot.
<p>
"Prince Vegeta of the Saiyajin? I am Prince Khara of Lankha, and this
is my sister Princess Sinhika; my father the king has anxiously
awaited your arrival, and invites you to be his guest. I am at your
service, noble prince." The emerald-eyed prince bowed again, and
indicated the tiger chariot with one white-gloved hand.
<p>

<p>
In downtown Satan City, a perfectly ordinary human being strode down
the street, seething with anger.  Well, actually, Sean Nixon was far
from perfect, and not exactly ordinary, but he was human, and he was
still angry. He viciously kicked a discarded can out of his path as he
hurried, black trench coat flapping around his legs.
<p>
"Man, I cannot believe this!" he ranted to the pink-haired girl beside
him. "First, this big ugly demon-thing appears out of nowhere and
destroys the best club in the city, not to mention turning my boss
into a monster, but somehow spares my fleabag apartment, and now, just
as I've gotten things put back together from that catastrophe, I get
an eviction notice!  HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO PAY RENT WHEN SOME
UGLY FUNKY-ASS MONSTER WASTED MY JOB?  Then I had to redo all my
design work FROM SCRATCH! How was I supposed to know that one of those
martial artist weirdos would destroy the bank vaults where the offsite
backups were 'safely' stored?  It took so long, we would have lost the
friggin' website contract even if my boss hadn't been turned into some
gray drooling thing with tentacles! Man, this just friggin' sucks!"
Sean waved the offending form letter in the air for emphasis, and then
threw it on the ground and stomped on it a few times.
<p>
"Calm down, Sean. Next time, more beer, less coffee, eh?" The
pink-haired girl in the very short black miniskirt (and black leather
blouse and black fishnet hose and black spike heels) picked up the
offending letter, which bore repeated signs of Sean's wrath in the
form of Doc Martens treadmarks all over it. She handed it back to him
with a wry smile.
<p>
He took it back in a long-nailed (painted dark purple) hand. "I
suppose I better keep this for my records, especially if I want to
contest it." Sean sighed. "Damn it! If I can't earn a living, I have
to go back home.. to Nebraska.. to my parents." The gloom in his voice
made it clear he thought that a fate comparable to a painful death at
the hands of a berserk demon.
<p>
Pomona giggled. "You'd miss good old Satan City that much?"
<p>
"I'd miss YOU. And that's another thing," Sean started off on another
rant, "are we the only ones who can see what a sleazeball fraud
Mr. Satan is? I can't believe the dumb jerks around here actually
RENAMED THE CITY after him! I didn't see HIM out fighting that demon a
few months ago, did you?  Of course, all the Shiny Happy People around
here think Mr. Satan saved their butts, just because he got on TV and
said so."  Sean hawked and spit into a sewer grate.
<p>
Pomona wrinkled her nose. "I hear you, but could you find some less
disgusting way to express your contempt?"
<p>
"Well, if I were one of those aforementioned martial artists, I'd
fight in the next Tenka'ichi Budokai, beat the crap out of him, and
THEN spit on him."
<p>
"Cute, Sean. You sure have a way of making a statement, I'll give you
that."
<p>
"Think of it as performance art, with a political subtext."
<p>
Pomona rolled her eyes theatrically. "I don't know why you don't go
back to art, anyway. You were good, very good; with a few pieces on
exhibition, you'd have no trouble getting commissions and making some
real money!" Pomona frowned.
<p>
Sean winced as the sun came out from behind a cloud. He pulled a pair
of mirrorshades from an inside coat pocket and donned them. Coal-black
hair drooped into his eyes. "Oh, I was good--too good. Let's not go
there, okay." He sounded suddenly old and tired.
<p>
Pomona shrugged. "Whatever. Look, if you need a job, why not just
apply for another job? I know you liked the old one, but just until you
get on your feet, ya know?"
<p>
"Underpaid thralls are a dime-a-dozen around here; a foreigner like
me...Nah.  Besides, do I look like the suit-and-tie salaryman type?"
Sean grinned rakishly at her, black fedora cocked at an angle, black
trench coat open to reveal black lace-frilled shirt and black jeans.
<p>
"Drawing pretty pictures for a web design house isn't the only thing
you know how to do, my pretty goth boi!" Pomona said significantly.
<p>
"Hmmm.. you've got a point there." He pulled out a clove cigarette
and lit it. "I wonder who in this city might need a first-class
hacker?" Sean "VirtualBlack" Nixon speculated.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Several hours later, Sean leaned back in his computer chair and
stretched. "That does it," he said to himself. "Got everything set up
and ready to go."  He lit another clove, and shook his head. "Some of
these guys need a security expert really bad.. Doesn't anybody in this
town keep up with the latest vulnerabilities and hacks?  Well,
tomorrow is soon enough to start sending out my 'resume'."
<p>
"Makoto, close 'VirtualBlack'," he commanded his computer. "Makoto, open
'Dreams'."  Sean sat back to stare at the list of files, trembling
slightly. He'd deliberately misled Pomona into thinking he'd given up
art entirely.  He hadn't, of course--he could no more stop drawing
than he could stop breathing; it was in his soul.
<p>
Now the computer screen was his canvas, and Sean painted with pixels
instead of acrylics.  He tried to convince himself it was safe that
way. They were just files, strings of 1s and 0s on a disk, not actual
images. He could dispose of them in an instant, with the flick of a
key, instead of slashing and burning them, if they started
to.. change. When he wasn't viewing them, they didn't exist as
pictures--no canvas surface providing a window or a door.. He hoped it
was safe. He really did.
<p>
"Makoto, display 'Game of Demon Kings.'" The image he'd been working
on, the image that he'd dreamed of, the image he couldn't get out of
his head, sprang into being on his screen.
<p>
It was a still image of two chess players in an opulent room whose
decor and architecture suggested Persia or India.  Beyond them, an
tall window overlooked the sea. The players drew the eye immediately;
one was a tall, handsome, black-skinned demon with sharp claws and
fangs, dressed in costly embroidered, bejewelled tunic and trousers,
wearing a turban with a great ruby pin.  Long, dark blue hair spilled
out from below his turban; his eyes were sapphire blue and keenly
regarding the marble chessboard, as one clawed hand reached out to
touch a piece.
<p>
The other player was less obviously demonic, but not less remarkable;
a short, well-muscled man with a crest of upswept black hair, and
too-wide eyes rested his chin on a white-gloved hand as he studied the
board, frowning. He wore some form of high-tech white armor over a
dark bodysuit, and a red cape tossed back over his chair. A badge of
some kind was engraved in red on the right breast of his armor,
something rather like a pitchfork crossed with an anchor. This other
player looked almost human--until you noticed the eyes were too large
and the eyebrows arched odddly, and the unlikely hair.. and the
white-furred tail wrapped around his waist. There was something in his
expression, a relentless ferocity, that scared Sean, and he had
painted it himself!
<p>
Sean studied the picture. No, it didn't really need anymore touching
up, but.. had he painted the chess pieces in those positions? He
didn't think so, but he wasn't a chess player, and the patterns had no
special significance to remember. Sean wiped the sweat from his
brow; man, this apartment was hot all of a sudden!
<p>
Please, God, don't let it happen again! he prayed silently. "Makoto,
close picture. Makoto, start new picture."  Time to work on something
else, yeah, that was it.
<p>

<p>
"That's it!" Bulma yelped with excitement, staring at the
display. "NOW I see how that power detection circuit goes together!"
She frowned at the translated tech manual on her computer. "Somebody
should have put a damping filter on the gain, though. I see why the
silly things blow up all the time."
<p>
Raditz looked rather red-eyed and tired; they'd been working on
translating Bulma's new tech manuals almost non-stop since she'd
returned to Capsule Corp grounds, with breaks for odd things like
sleep and food.
<p>
"Bardock--my father--mentioned that once; he intended to revise the
design. There was some issue with sensitivity, though, that made it
complicated. And then Frieza killed him, and blew the planet up, so it
didn't get done..."  Raditz trailed off. He shook himself. "I think
I'm going to cut back on the translation work a bit-- borrow that
gravity chamber of Vegeta's and work on my own training in the
mornings. I'll start getting lazy if I just park my tail in front of a
computer all day."
<p>
"Um, okay." Bulma looked a bit subdued; somehow she'd managed to step
into painful territory. She sighed; that had happened with Vegeta
sometimes, too. She brightened up. "We're making good progress
though--besides revisions to the scouter design, the armor shouldn't
be too hard to duplicate, either--if my materials engineers can work
out that 'tight coil' long-chain polymer you guys used to make it so
elastic.  Elegant--it responds to pressure from one direction, the
inside, by stretching, and pressure from the other direction, the
outside, by contracting and becoming more rigid."
<p>
"Will I have new armor soon?" He watched her out from under
half-closed eyelids.
<p>
"Raditz! Is that ALL you think about?  That, and your scouter?  Have a
little patience!" Bulma stood, yawned and stretched, unaware of
Raditz's frank and admiring gaze.
<p>
No, that's not *all* I think about. I should spend a lot less time
alone with you, though. You're entirely too pleasant to look at, and
have courage, and wit and such a fascinating personality--and you
belong to my prince! Raditz, remember that!
<p>
She forgets I am not Kakarott, and that Vegeta is not here. Not
consciously, but in her habits, her manners--my brother is a good
friend, and has never been anything more, it seems--and never thought
of being anything more to her.  She is relaxed around him, even
careless, and accepts me as Kakarott's brother--and is as careless
with me as she is with Kakarott. Fool woman! I am NOT my brother; you
should not trust me anymore than you do other men--I have seen how
guarded you are with them.
<p>
I have to protect her from herself, and from myself. *Sigh* Vegeta,
why did you do this to me??
<p>

<p>
Vegeta at that moment was not in the least concerned with what he had
done or not done to Raditz. At that moment, Prince Vegeta regarded his
royal host with some bemusement.  These Rakshasa continually amazed
him; infuriating him nearly to violence with their games of illusion,
and then turning about and treating him like the prince he was, all
deference and courtesy. Fawning flattery he would have thought it,
save that he could sense the power smouldering behind King Vibishana's
eyes, and knew that as a ghost, he, Vegeta, was little threat to the
living. Their courtesy was not that of fear, but genuine deference to
his rank and name.
<p>
A remarkable creature, this Rakshasa king. He was monarch of a race of
fierce proud warriors, night-hunting, man-eating demons, who reminded
the Saiyan of his own people. The Rakshasas also used ki--they flew,
and shaped illusions, and used their own power to enhance mundane
weapons to supernatural sharpness and toughness--an odd use of ki that
Vegeta had never encountered before. And their ability to hide their
own power, in fact their whole existance, astounded him. To fight
invisibly--what an advantage!
<p>
Still, he was not here to admire the Rakshasas' talents. They had
expected him, welcomed him for reasons that seemed obscure to
Vegeta--that nonsense about him being a descendant of Hanuman, who was
apparently a close friend of King Vibishana's.  Preposterous on the
face of it, and yet.. Prince Vegeta glanced at the new white tail he
had so strangely acquired, and remembered the image of the white
ouzaru.  Enough of that! Let them believe whatever nonsense they chose
to, as long as it made them so cooperative! Cooperative.. to a point.
<p>
"Even from here I can sense it," Vegeta growled, looking out the tall
window at the ocean.  "It's out there, half in the spirit world, half
in the real world, gathering its damned power--sooner or later, it
will return." He turned from the window to glare at the tall
sapphire-eyed king.  "That.. thing is as much your enemy as mine,
Vibishana!  Prince Khara told me of the Rakshasa..  'dharma'." He
pronounced the unfamiliar word with a strange accent.
<p>
King Vibishana nodded. "It is the dharma of the Rakshasa to protect
all that is holy to the Creator from that which would despoil and
unmake it. By tradition, we have protected the temples and holy
places, but the duty goes deeper than that."  Dark blue locks stirred
in the breeze as the king lowered his voice, pensive.  "I know not
what brought this doom upon you and your lineage, but it is not of our
doing, or of our dharma. We remain apart."
<p>
Prince Vegeta's eyes widened, and his brows lowered with anger. This
was the sticking point that infuriated him--the Rakshasa king would
give Vegeta anything he wanted--in Lankha. Knowledge, magic, a wicked
game of chess.. but he refused to stir outside the hidden city.
"Don't be a fool, Vibishana!  That thing's nature is destruction! It's
not hungry, or angry or vengeful--it just wants to make things.. not
be!  If that thing runs free, it will not stop with my family--it will
destroy everything you care about, and you will be too late and too
weak to stop it!  Destroy that filth while it is weak!"
<p>
Sapphire eyes regarded Prince Vegeta keenly.  King Vibishana nodded
gravely. "I would be a fool were I to ignore wisdom, even if the
specifics please me not. The demon is rightfully yours--thy enmity is
personal and great; for myself, I still believe the thing a doom
against thyself and thy lineage alone, which will return to whatever
hell it came from when it is done with thee. But, should you fall, and
fate proves me wrong, I will stand against it."
<p>
Finally! At least he concedes that much. "You'd have to stand in line
behind Kakarott and his son..."  Prince Vegeta said wryly.  He
scowled.  "More useful would be an alliance in advance. Your power is
a fraction of theirs; if they fall after me, what could you do but
die?"
<p>
"That I cannot do; I am immortal, and cannot be slain." King Vibishana
smiled, somewhat amused.
<p>
"Immortal! That could be useful!." Prince Vegeta regarded the other
monarch thoughtfully. "I once intended to wish for immortality..."
<p>
"Obviously, you did not."
<p>
"At the time, I was.. interrupted." Prince Vegeta said somewhat sourly,
remembering the terrible fight with Kakarott when he came to Earth for
the dragonballs, and the missed third wish on Namek.  "Later, I knew
better.. What joy is there in fighting, if there is no risk to it?"
<p>
King Vibishana smiled sadly. "The dharma of a king is graver still
than that of a warrior. I must do that which is right, for my people
and for their dharma, not that which pleases myself alone." He looked
into the distant horizon. "Long ago, I would have followed Rama to
heaven, but my dharma, my duty, is here. So long as this fair blue
world exists, and we Rakshasa live to protect that which is hallowed,
I cannot die."
<p>
Ghost though he was, Prince Vegeta shivered. I am prince.. but I was
never king. I am the heir, and if any had survived to crown me, I
would have been king--and I would have borne that burden! Is that the
burden you bore, father?  The burden of doing what was best for the
Saiyajin, no matter how much pain it cost you?  And still bear--I have
seen you in Hell!  Damned Saiyajin.. still your people. Even though
you were mortal, and died, you are still their king, in Hell.
<p>
I once blamed myself for Vegetasai's destruction, knowing that you
attacked Frieza over me. If you had not.. cared about me, Frieza would
not have killed you, and followed your regicide with Vegetasai's
genocide. So I believed, and I refused to allow anyone to so care
about me again. I destroyed a world that dared to call me a hero!
<p>
Later, I blamed you for the death of our world--if you had not been
weak in your affection for me, you would have not attacked Frieza and
doomed us all. I thought you a fool who had thrown away his kingdom
and his people for the sake of one child--for purely personal desires.
I hated you for your weakness and folly, and refused to allow myself
any such weakness.
<p>
Only after I died on Namek and met you again did I finally understand.
Frieza decided our doom long before you challenged him over me--and
even if he had not.. It was not just for personal desire that you
challenged Frieza; you had to challenge that monster, for how could
you be king, how could you rule over and protect our people if you
could not even protect your own child from our enemies? It was not
weakness that sent you against Frieza; it was strength!
<p>
A weak king would have yielded his authority to save his life, a weak
man would have sacrificed his child to save himself! You were strong,
stronger than I could know.
<p>
Prince Vegeta returned his attention to King Vibishana. I think I have
the measure of this man.. demon.. whatever, now. "You want to join in
this fight, don't you?"
<p>
"With all my heart!" Vibishana's fierce sapphire gaze burned into
Vegeta's. "Were it my pleasure alone, I would come against this
abomination with the all the host of the Rakshasas! But it is not my
pleasure alone, and it is my people's safety and the fulfillment of
our ancient duty that I must weigh against my own desire in this."
<p>
Vegeta's lip curled up in that devilish smirk. "As you say.. the demon
is mine! I will deal with that monster--but his host infests the upper
hells, and are as vile as the demon himself." Prince Vegeta looked out
across the sea for long moments, as King Vibishana waited for him to
continue.  "When the demon returns to Earth.."
<p>
"You expect his host to follow." It was a statement, not a question.
<p>
"Yes." His eyes narrowed as he looked at the Rakshasa King.
<p>
The corner of Vibishana's mouth quirked very slightly into the ghost
of a smile. He nodded. "Yes," he answered the unvoiced question.
<p>
The noble rakshasa regarded Prince Vegeta. "Has the beast a name, or
you some clue to its true nature?"
<p>
"It wasn't polite enough to introduce itself, although it seemed to
know some of <i>our</i> names." Vegeta brooded, seated on the sill of the
window, staring across the sea at those he could not see, save in his
heart. He remembered the demon's malevolent obsession with Gohan and
Bulma and even young Trunks.
<p>
They must be warned--and I cannot warn them! Kakarott knows NOTHING of
this--he thinks the thing destroyed, and everyone is safe and sound,
thanks to my 'noble sacrifice' and his final attack! The fool! If she
dies of HIS complacency, I will not forgive!
<p>
Or.. can I warn them? Yes! There just might be a way!
<p>
"Two things, King Vibishana." Prince Vegeta regarded the rakshasa
thoughtfully, dark eyes unblinking. "You hid the way to Lankha behind
illusion, did you not? That is why the demon passed you by, and
smashed through Lower Hell instead!"
<p>
The tall rakshasa smiled ever so slightly. "Yes, I did." He regarded
Prince Vegeta quizzically. "Why?"
<p>
Vegeta laughed triumphantly. "HE CAN'T SEE THROUGH YOUR ILLUSIONS!" He
spun to glare at the sea's distant horizon. "If I can sense him, he
almost certainly can sense me, except for Lankha's--your--illusions. I
will need to.. borrow a few of them for a bit."
<p>
He turned back to face King Vibishana. "As for the other..." Vegeta
thought a bit, remembering a cryptic phrase Raditz used: "further from
the mortal world than anything short of Chaos itself" -- and the broo,
with their exultant hate and self-knowledge that they were Chaotics.
<p>
"What is Chaos?"
<p>

<p>
Rainbow-colored mud bubbled desultorily in an ancient dump, now
inundated by the wandering river that had once been channeled by the
built-up banks of an eastern city. That had been before the Saiyajin
came, before a bored Nappa had obliterated a thriving metropolis in
the blink of an eye.  Now only ruins remained at the edge of a great
crater; only crows and rats dwelled where people once lived.
<p>
No, not only crows and rats dwelled there. In the darkness, mud heaved
and surged as something formed itself from toxin and filth. Deputy
regarded his greater self with a critical eye; no. It was not yet
ready.  The mud subsided as something dispersed itself scarcely before
it had finished forming.
<p>
From the instant of separation, Deputy had diverged from his greater
self. Though he felt all the imperatives laid on his greater self,
Deputy sought his own path to fulfill them. He did not wait on his
greater self.  Deputy plotted.
<p>
The scheme unfolded. As his greater self had done before, Deputy
wrenched himself apart. When he was done, three beings stood where one
had been before: Deputy, and two smaller others.
<p>
Deputy, himself the size of a small house, turned to the smallest, a
slender, lithe demon, like a small dinosaur, scarce bigger than a man,
whose hide rippled and changed colors at whim.  "You are Scout; seek
our victims, find them, learn about them and return to me.  Do not
fight them, do not even let them know you exist, but return to me with
knowledge! Now, go!"
<p>
The raptor-like demon nodded its horned head once, unfurled slender,
swift wings, and darted away into the sky.
<p>
The other demon was wingless, and half again as tall as a man. Corded
muscles bulged its scaly, shadowy, hide; a wide mouth filled with far
too many sharp teeth grinned perpetually. Except for the dull grey
claws, and lurid red eyes, the rest of it was blacker than black, the
very stuff of darkness.
<p>
"You are Enforcer; gather our worshippers, bring them to me, let them
serve us! They have forgotten us, but you will remind them. I say to
you, avoid our victims, fight them not, do not even let them know you
exist--their doom is mine to devise. Now, go!"
<p>
The shadow demon nodded, and disappeared into the night.  Deputy, who
was the very image in miniature of that one version of his greater
self, sank back into the mud and filth that was his hiding place.  His
greater self would take the Saiyajin warriors--but Deputy would take
the weak ones, the woman and the children.  He giggled to himself;
"'woe and grief, such that they will beg for death and curse the day
of their birth'."  He looked forward to the fun.

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Ghost">VIII. GHOST PRINCE</A></H1>
<p>
"Brother mine, you may be my elder, but you are not the king!"
Princess Sinhika the Rakshasa bared delicate fangs at her brother,
Prince Khara. She was dressed in jeans and cotton blouse, for
travelling, all her Lankha finery put away. Amber cat-eyes flashed
angrily as she defied her brother. "I will NOT stay home safe in
Lankha while such things are afoot--besides, I have been out in the
world before. Where do you think I got that?" she pointed to the
framed baccalaureate degree hanging on her dayroom wall.
<p>
"This isn't the twentieth century anymore, and you are not planning a
trip to California, dear sister! The world is not so safe for our
kind as it once was, and.."
<p>
"It's not the sixteenth century, either! I swear, you'd have me in
veils in proper purdah if you could!" The orange-haired rakshasa girl
grumbled under her breath something about "Neanderthals".
<p>
Prince Khara frowned; sometimes his sister's manners were
atrocious. "If I were the king, I wouldn't have let you go to college
in California, either--you've been so.. common ever since!"
<p>
"COMMON! THAT DOES IT! GET YOUR SNOBBISH ROYAL BUTT THE HELL OUT OF
MY ROOMS, YOU--YOU MALE CHAUVINIST PIG!" Sinhika's beautiful dark face
changed into something hideous and scaly with snakes for hair.
<p>
Prince Khara got the hell out, followed by a flung chair -- solid
mahogany.  He didn't run, but hurried down the hall as fast as dignity
would permit.
<p>
"AND STAY OUT!" Princess Sinhika stomped into the hall and screamed
after her departing brother, face back to normal.
<p>
"Well, well. Quite the show," commented Prince Vegeta, his tone
faintly mocking. "You remind me of someone I know."
<p>
"Eeep!" Sinhika jumped and whirled. Her father's guest, the ghost
prince, watched her, amused. Apparently he had been coming down the
hall from the other direction when she and Khara had their..
difference of opinion.
<p>
Her ebony face flushed with embarassment. "Umm, it's not as bad as it
seems. We, um, argue a lot--brother-sister thing, you know?" Oh gods,
don't let him have heard all of it! If he tells father, I'm sunk!
<p>
His eyes flicked in the direction of her room, where the loaded backpack
was plainly visible. "Going somewhere?"
<p>
"Um, no, just a short daytrip into the mountains--visiting the old
temples," Sinhika lied.
<p>
Prince Vegeta smirked. "Have.. fun." With that, he continued down the
hall.
<p>
Sinhika slumped against the doorframe in relief. Whew! I think he
believed me! That guy gives me the creeps--and not just because he's
dead. Time to get out of here--before dad finds out.  He hasn't
explictly forbidden me to leave Lankha, but once Khara tells him my
plans, he will!  At least my trip <i>starts</i> in the mountains like I
told Prince Vegeta... I just didn't mention the part where I fly down
to Colombo and catch a plane to my destination.
<p>
Far down the hall, Prince Vegeta smirked to himself. Really, the
princess shouldn't tell lies like that--not when she's left her
passport and a Satan City guidebook lying next to her open
backpack. It's just too obvious.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Vegeta spent several weeks in the city of the Rakshasas, learning what
there was to learn.  Among the hidden treasures and lore of the
Rakshasas, Prince Vegeta found paths to both his goals--and as old
Maricha had predicted, they diverged in opposite directions. To be
returned to life, his spirit had to return to Earth; to discover the
secret of his enemy, he had to pursue it to its origins, to the very
edge of Chaos, beyond the bounds of Time.
<p>
Chaos--to the Rakshasa, a philosophical concept: the formless void
before creation, before time, out of which the universe was
formed. Not nothingness, but rather formlessness, complete randomness,
all possibilities, and no actuality. In the Underworld, which was
itself purely philosophical to the living, and hard reality to the
dead, Chaos was more than philosophical. As best he could grasp it,
Chaos was what lay 'outside' the universe, 'outside' time, if one
could conceive of such a thing--or if one could reach such a place.
<p>
What neither he nor Vibishana could believe was that something like
life could exist in Chaos.  And yet.. one common thread linked the
broo, the demon, and the demon's mutant creations. All of them were
mutated and corrupted; changed randomly from the true in some fashion.
<p>
Prince Vegeta brooded long in thought. I MUST learn more. I do not yet
know the thing's secrets--I'm not ready to fight it yet. It will not
be easy pass by it and warn them--it lurks too close to this world; if
it were not for Rakshasa illusions hiding Lankha, it would know I am
here, and it WOULD come looking for me! Even were I returned to life,
I am not ready!  Damn this! At least when Kakarrot was dead the first
time, he knew he had a year to prepare for my arrival--but I know no
such thing. That demon could return to Earth at any time, and I would
be too late!
<p>
He arose from his brooding.  I know what I have to do, and the path I
must follow. "King Vibishana! It is time."
<p>

<p>
"Chi-chi! Ox King! This is a wonderful surprise!" Bulma greeted her
friends as they piled out of the aircar, Chi-chi carrying Goten. Goku
and Gohan had already arrived, flying ahead.
<p>
Goku grinned. "I was coming over to train Trunks, and Goten wouldn't
be left behind, and Chi-chi's been worrying about how you were
doing, so we just brought the whole gang!"
<p>
"Yoo-hoo! Goku, Gohan! I've got cold drinks for everyone!" Mrs. Briefs
came out carrying a tray of tall iced drinks.
<p>
"Mom! You knew!" Bulma jokingly accused. She looked around. "Speaking
of Trunks, where'd he get to? I thought he'd be out here..."
<p>
"Yes, dear. Chi-chi called ahead." She smiled at her daughter. "I sent
Trunks to tell Raditz that Goku was here."
<p>
"Nunk Rats?" Goten asked. "Where Nunk Rats?"
<p>
"Right here, kid," Raditz announced as he came around the corner.
Trunks ran to keep up with the tall Saiyan.
<p>
"Goten stop squirming---oh!" Chi-chi exclaimed as her youngest
wriggled free of her grasp and jumped to the ground, only to run over
to his uncle and start climbing his hair.
<p>
Raditz suddenly gasped in pain; Goten, in his determined climb, had
put a foot firmly on his tail.  Eyes watering from the pain, Raditz
seized Goten by his hair and held him at arm's length, bouncing him a
bit.
<p>
"HEY! HAIR HURTS!"
<p>
Raditz pulled him closer and held him nose-to-nose. "Tail hurts, kid!"
he growled. "Do NOT step on, swing from, pull on, bite or mess with my
tail! Got that?"  He uncurled his long tail and gently wrapped it
around Goten's waist, taking some of the weight off of the child's
hair.
<p>
"Oops. Sorry." Goten tried making a very sad and pathetic face.
<p>
"Yeah, I bet. Tell you what, kid--everytime you hurt my tail, I hang
you by your hair for a while. Sound fair to you?"
<p>
Goten brightened up. "Fair!"
<p>
Raditz set him down, and Chi-chi promptly snatched Goten up and glared
at Raditz with an aggrieved look. She opened her mouth to say
something--
<p>
"Ah, don't yell at my brother," Goku interrupted cheerily. "He went
easy on Goten. I remember how much it hurt when my tail got
crunched--if he'd REALLY been fair, he'd have grabbed him by the
tender spot on the other end!"
<p>
Gohan winced; he didn't remember how much tails hurt--he'd never had
his bruised before it was removed for good, but he sure knew about the
other tender spot!
<p>
Chi-chi glared murderously at her husband, her son, and her
brother-in-law, and marched inside without a word--or started to. Once
again, with surprising strength and agility, Goten wriggled free and
jumped down to assault his uncle's hair. This time, he was very
careful not to step on Raditz's tail.
<p>
"Umm, Goku-san?" Trunks piped up. "Is it time to train now, or.."
<p>
"Yes, that's what I came for," Goku smiled. "Raditz, keep an eye on
that little wild man for me, okay?"
<p>
"Maybe we sit in and watch, hmmm?" Raditz didn't bother holding Goten;
the child was sitting on his shoulder and kept his balance.
<p>
"Good idea. He'll be three next week; Gohan's going to start him on
the basics in about six months; I'll be working with Trunks and Gohan
on their advanced training."
<p>
"Kakarott, about that advanced training..." Raditz hesitated, seeming
almost embarassed.
<p>
Goku gave his brother a knowing look. "Ah, you want to train too,
don't you?"
<p>
Raditz flushed slightly. "The first time I came to Earth, I called you
ill-trained. That was far from the stupidest thing I said back then,
but it wasn't one of the few smart things I said, either.  You and
Piccolo were much weaker than I, yet you k--defeated me. You are
right--power isn't everything."
<p>
Goku looked his brother over. "I think that's a yes. Come on,
then. We were going to use Vegeta's gravity room, okay?"
<p>
"Okay!"
<p>
On the roof of a nearby building, flattened down and camouflaged, the
perfect chamaeleon, Scout, watched and listened and learned.

<p>
"Mr. Hiregumi," Bulma addressed the Capsule Corp. Chief of Security,
"I called you to my office to brief you privately on a new..
employee."
<p>
"That would be the long-haired gentleman I've seen around the
grounds?"
<p>
Bulma nodded. "Raditz is.. one of my late husband's people, and his
sworn vassal." Yes, the simple truth was the best way to handle
Hiregumi--he was such a traditionalist.
<p>
"Go on," the security chief's face was impassive.
<p>
"He had sworn an oath to Prince Vegeta to protect Trunks and myself
with his life, until his prince releases him from that duty." Bulma
paused, looking at Mr. Hiregumi.
<p>
His face brightened perceptibly. "Ah! I am glad you told me of this,
madam. That explains much. I would not stand in the way of such a
duty; indeed, I must know how I may smooth the way."
<p>
Bulma smiled; this was going very well indeed. "Raditz needs to be
brought up to speed on our security operations and procedures, and--"
she leaned forward, "most especially local laws!" She sat back, and
looked a bit apologetic. "If you remember the Prince..."
<p>
"Ah, yes." Mr. Hiregumi was always discrete. "I assume that the noble
prince had broad judicial authority in his own country--he reminded me
of a daimyo of old Japan in his treatment of transgressors."
<p>
"That," Bulma noted, "is very perceptive." She rose from behind her
desk. "Also, if Raditz..", she wrinkled her brow--how do I phrase
this? "..ever thinks there's trouble on the way, listen to him, and do
what he says! He's very capable, in his own way."
<p>
"Hai! I shall keep that in mind, madam." He bowed, and departed; the
interview was over.
<p>
Bulma sighed as the door closed behind Mr. Hiregumi. She'd manage to
talk about Vegeta for five minutes without bursting into tears; but
oh, how her heart ached! It was a lump in her throat, it was a
dreadful hollow rip in her soul. She rested her head on her hands,
tears trickling down her face now.
<p>
"Can't do this now, got to be cheerful for Mom and Goku and the kids!"
she told herself fiercely. "I'll just wipe my face and read through my
business e-mail--that's just the thing to calm me down. If it doesn't
put me completely to sleep."
<p>
Unfortunately, it didn't calm her down. Bulma's executive assistant
came running at her scream of outrage (Bulma didn't believe in calling
her female secretary a 'secretary'; too many sexist, demeaning
connotations for a valuable, skilled job. Why was it that 'secretary'
was a high-ranking title for men, and so looked-down-on for women?).
<p>
"WHO DOES THIS VIRTUAL-BLACK TWERP THINK HE IS?? HOW DARE HE MESS WITH
MY COMPUTER SYSTEMS!!" Bulma was red and steaming.  "Ooooh!  And he
has the nerve--THE NERVE!!--to tell me he can 'fix' my problems! If I
PAY him, of course!  The little twerp! When I find out who he is...!"
<p>
Bulma snarled, "Well, I don't need to be a Saiyan warrior to deal with
little twit hackers! You just made a big mistake, creep, messing with
Bulma in her own territory!"
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Goku awoke suddenly. For a second he was disoriented; this wasn't his
room! But Chi-chi was curled up next to him as if they were at
home.. Then he remembered that they'd decided to spend the night at
Capsule Corp after training hard all day and eating the huge supper
Bulma's mom had prepared--they'd finished late, and neither Chi-chi
nor Gohan had been up to driving home safely.
<p>
But what woke him? He calmed himself, and listened, feeling the world
around him.  There was something.. out.. there. Ever so softly, he got
out of the bed, careful not to disturb Chi-chi, and padded to the
window.
<p>
A half-moon shone down; it was still early in the night. Goku idly
wondered how many times Kami had replaced the orb.. and dismissed the
thought as he sensed a presence close at hand.  What was this?  He
turned his head toward the one; distant, powerful, evil.. and
gone again. It was that dark presence that had woken him from sleep
weeks ago!  What was it?  It never stayed around long enough for him
to truly find it, but it made Goku very uneasy.
<p>
Closer to hand.. something not-quite-there, and a certain familiarity
to it that raised the hairs on the back of Goku's neck. Could it be?
He stepped outside the room, so as not to disturb Chi-chi.
<p>
"Vegeta?" Goku asked hesitantly.
<p>
"Very good, Kakarott! I didn't expect you to notice me so easily!"
Vegeta's voice echoed in Goku's mind.
<p>
"Ah, Frieza isn't beating me over the head this time. Makes it easier
to hear someone who isn't.. here." Goku relaxed himself a bit more,
let his mind 'listen' the way it did when he talked to King Kai. As
before, on Namek, he looked 'sideways' a bit (as he thought of it) and
could see, very dimly, Vegeta.
<p>
"Hmmph. Pay attention, Kakarott, I don't have much time. You didn't
finish off that demon; it can cross over from the spirit world and
reform its body, and start all over again. I don't know when it will
come back, but it WILL come back!"
<p>
"No!" Goku's eyes went wide with horror. "But.. if we kill it again--"
<p>
"It will come back, AGAIN, Kakarott! You can't kill it, I couldn't
kill it, no one, not even Gohan, can kill that damnable thing! Not
permanently."
<p>
"There MUST be a way!" Goku's face was stern, none of his usual
cheerfulness showed. He clenched his fists. "I won't let that monster
win!"
<p>
"Glad you feel that way, Kakarott." Vegeta said dryly in the other
Saiyan's mind. "We're of the same mind on that!" the ghost prince
snarled. "I intend to find out the thing's secrets, Kakarott--and when
I do, I WILL kill it!"
<p>
"Before you find your way back to life?" Goku asked, the hint of a
smile on his face.
<p>
"WHAT?? What do you know about that?" Vegeta seemed genuinely
surprised.
<p>
"Raditz said you were trying to find a way out of Hell, back to
life. He thought you were up to something more, too." Goku said
nonchalantly, mischief in his eyes.
<p>
"RADITZ?? How have you been talking to--?? Where is that baka ghost?--I
couldn't find him around here!"
<p>
Goku grinned. "You haven't heard?  My brother's alive!"
<p>
"ALIVE?? Alive? How did that idiot manage to--? Kakarott, what has
happened?" Vegeta seemed bewildered.
<p>
"It's a long story, Vegeta, but Bulma found a wish--wasn't strong
enough to bring you back, she tried, but by accident she wished Raditz
back. Lots of strange things happened, Gohan and Raditz killed a bad
one, you got to hear the story from Bulma when you get back!"
<p>
"Obviously." Vegeta seemed to have recovered his composure. "What is
he doing now?"
<p>
"Ah, he's Bulma and Trunks bodyguard--said he promised you he'd
protect them."
<p>
"He did. Well, well, well." Vegeta laughed soundlessly. "That's one
thing that turned out better than I expected!" He turned serious once
again. "Listen, Kakarott!  If Bulma finds any more wishes, or you get
Namek's dragonballs, or whatever, don't wish me back yet! I'm not
ready; first I've got to find that damn thing's secret!"
<p>
"But how? If you're in Hell, and that thing is here..."
<p>
"It came from beyond the Lower Hells, Kakarott! And it left a trail, a
trail I will follow--have followed--am following! Just wait until I
tell you--and send that monster back to Hell as many times as it takes
until I get back! Do you understand me, Kakarott?"
<p>
"Yes! Don't worry, I won't let anything happen to them." Goku nodded,
a determined look on his face.
<p>
"Daddy? 'Geta?" A sleepy Goten peeked around the frame of the boy's bedroom
door, then ran down the hall waving his arms.  He ran past Goku, and
stopped, frowning. "'Geta no fun!" Suddenly anxious, he grabbed Goku's
leg. "Daddy fun!"
<p>
Goku swept up Goten. "Little wild man, what are you doing out of bed
in the middle of the night?  Shhhh, you'll wake Mommy and Bulma up!"
<p>
"Thirsty. Want a glass a' water."
<p>
"Kakarott, am I imagining things, or DID THAT KID SEE ME??" Vegeta
seemed shocked.
<p>
"Oh, Goten can see spirits," Goku chuckled. "Raditz found that out
first; Goten saw my brother and kept trying to tell us about him, and
for weeks none of us had any idea what he was talking about!"
<p>
"See 'Geta!" Goten confirmed vigorously. "He talks like Nunk
Rats--call daddy 'Carrot'." Goten giggled. "Water now, daddy?"
<p>
Goku felt Vegeta's silent astonishment. Finally, the ghostly Saiyan
spoke again in his mind. "That.. is interesting. I have little time,
Kakarott, and things to do before that damn demon gets wind of
me. Remember what I told you!"  With that, all sense of Vegeta's
presence vanished.
<p>
"Where 'Geta go?" Goten exclaimed, confused.
<p>
"I don't know," Goku said slowly. "Let's get you that water, okay?"
<p>
"'kay!"
<p>

<p>
Bulma dreamed a sweet dream. No more nightmares, but a dream so
poignant-sweet...  She dreamed Vegeta lay beside her, and caressed her
hair as she lay sleeping. In her dream, she opened her eyes, to find
her lost prince looking at her with such a sweet-sad expression of
longing.
<p>
"Silly woman," he said, in his rude-affectionate way, "you cry too
much. I'm not that easily gotten rid of!" Vegeta grinned wolfishly,
and held her tightly.
<p>
"Vegeta.." she wrapped her arms around his strong neck, feeling his
hard, muscular body next to hers. "Damn you! Come back to me, you
bastard!"
<p>
He rolled over, still holding her, coming to rest with her atop him,
looking down. "I will, I promise you that!" Vegeta reached up and
gently brushed Bulma's hair back from her face. "But not yet." He ran
one finger lightly down the line of her jaw, her neck, her collarbone,
lower still...
<p>
"Why not?" A tear dropped from her eye onto his bare chest. "There are
other wishes..."
<p>
He shook his head. "Not yet! First, I make sure you and Trunks are
never threatened by that demon-filth again! Not ever!" Vegeta
snarled, and then relaxed. He rolled Bulma over again, stopping with
himself on top this time.
<p>
"Trust me." He closed her mouth with a kiss as she started to ask him
again, a long, passionate kiss that went on and on..
<p>
Bulma started awake. She was alone, but the dim light of the half-moon
revealed the tossed and turned sheets on her bed--as if two people had
rolled around on it. And the scent of him lingered in the air...
<p>
"Come back to me, you sweet bastard," she whispered to the
night. "I'll be waiting for you."

<H1><A NAME="Serpent">IX. SERPENT'S DOWRY</A></H1>
<p>
"..and that is all that I have seen and heard and felt, Great Deputy,"
Scout concluded verbally after reporting through his mindlink to
Deputy. The raptor-like demon prostrated itself before the huge
crouching form of Deputy, its hide rippling patterns of grey and black
against the black mud and broken concreate.
<p>
Deputy crouched upon a broken wall and rustled his wings
impatiently. &lt;Enforcer?&gt; it queried the other demon through its
mindlink.
<p>
Enforcer bared its array of razor-sharp teeth. &lt;They have come to my
call--more easily than I predicted, in this distant age that has
forgotten Chaos and the Compact of Time. They worship the Greater
Self, and await your coming to mark them and grant them power!&gt; The
shadow demon bowed to Deputy.
<p>
&lt;They are ready to do the work?&gt;
<p>
&lt;They are ready, lacking only your touch.&gt; Enforcer
replied. &lt;"Rapists", "serial killers", "cannibals" --as this age calls
them, and power-hungry fools who crave destruction... they await
you. They were always ready; they lacked only a master.&gt;
<p>
&lt;This age is good!&gt; answered Deputy. &lt;Let the most capable prove
themselves in minor works before I initiate them.&gt;
<p>
&lt;What works shall I give them?&gt; the shadow demon puzzled. &lt;Our work,
or--&gt;
<p>
&lt;Something that supports our work. Scout, you also have a mind, add
what is useful.  Three there are who maximize the woe to our enemies:
the child Goten, beloved of the three males; the child Trunks, beloved
of the woman and protected by one of the males; and the woman Bulma,
beloved of her child, at least liked by both males, protected by one
of the males.  A dilemma: slay the child Trunks, and woe is brought to
the mother--but the child is spared further woe. Slay the mother, and
the child is bereaved, but the mother is spared. This is not
satisfactory. Both must suffer to the utmost!&gt;
<p>
&lt;Perhaps... a deception?&gt; Scout volunteered timorously.
<p>
&lt;Speak!&gt; commanded Deputy.
<p>
&lt;Let each believe the other slain in torment, soul damned/devoured,
without making it so until the end--will not both then suffer the
greatest woe?&gt;
<p>
"HSSSSSSS!" Deputy vocalized. &lt;Yes! That is good, Scout.&gt; He patted
the dinosaur demon patronizingly. &lt;But let all others believe BOTH
destroyed; then the male-protector will self-agonize at his failure,
and the other male lament, and both curse their fate.&gt;
<p>
&lt;It will take some planning,&gt; cautioned Enforcer.
<p>
&lt;My job!&gt; Deputy snarled, slime dripping from his jagged teeth. &lt;I
will tell you what plans are needed!&gt; A taloned hand snapped out and
knocked the powerful Enforcer sprawling. &lt;But first, the simplest
target: the child Goten.  Slay him in torment, degrade and destroy
him, and let the others know of it. Woe upon the brother and the
uncle, and the child-friend Trunks!  The father's grief shall be a
free bonus, our vengeance upon him.&gt;
<p>
&lt;They will hunt us for it!&gt; Scout quivered fearfully.  Enforcer nodded
affirmation.
<p>
&lt;Don't get caught, fools! You have inherited my gifts of
indetectability and intelligence--use them! Be clever!&gt; Deputy's
mindvoice was contemptuous. &lt;Remember! The two adult males and the
adolescent are for our Greater Self to destroy! Avoid them!&gt;
<p>
The great horned head turned to regard Enforcer. &lt;I will come to
initiate your followers when you sacrifice what is left of the child
Goten to Chaos!  Scout, your new assignment is to gather all
information and aid to Enforcer, that he may do as I have willed.
Now, go and make it so!&gt;
<p>
As he watched Scout flap off into the distance, a sound caught
Deputy's attention. He looked around--over there! A figure scurried
for shelter among the broken buildings.  Deputy drew dark lips back
from slime-dripping, jagged teeth, baring them in a snarl.  He lurched
into the air, flapping his massive pinions.
<p>
The scent of man filled his nostrils; someone thought to hide from him
here!  Deputy traced the man to a rude shelter nestled inside the
still-standing walls of another broken building, and alighted silently
atop the broken building's wall.
<p>
The man, a scavenger and junk dealer, cowered in his crude hut. What
was that thing? All he could imagine was that some horrible mutant had
grown in the blasted ruins of the nuked city. Fortunately, he thought,
the thing couldn't see him here in--
<p>
The ceiling collapsed as two taloned feet crashed through the plywood
and tarpaper shell. A taloned hand as big as he was reached down and
snatched him up as he lay there, paralyzed with terror. Deputy studied
his catch intently, long barbed tongue flicking in and out of his
mouth.
<p>
Humans were so easy. Deputy tittered as he raked a talon across the
man's belly.  The human's eyes bulged with horror as he saw the loops
of intestine spill out, and he grabbed at them and tried feebly to
push them back in. Deputy giggled again, and licked out with his
barbed tongue, hooking the entrails as the man began to scream in
agony and terror.  The demon pulled a loop of intestine into his jaws,
and began to slurp it up, slowly, savoring the flavor of the human's
long agony. Deputy closed his eyes, thinking blissfully of what he
would do with the blue-haired woman and the violet-haired child when
the time came. Only one thing was needful..
<p>
&lt;Enforcer!&gt; Deputy hurled a thought across their mindlink. &lt;Perform
the Chaos Spawn ritual, and summon some of my broo from Hell. They
will be needed for the woman.. and the child.&gt;
<p>

"Morning," Sean Nixon grunted at his neighbor from the apartment
across the hall. It was near midnight, but he always said
"Morning". His neighbor, an unshaven, surly looking fellow, glared at
him and slunk into his apartment. Sean shrugged as he turned the key
in the lock; he didn't like his neighbor anyway.
<p>
"Makoto, check e-mail," he yelled at the computer as he entered.
<p>
"You've got mail, baby." the computer replied in a sultry voice,
obediently displaying the day's correspondence.
<p>
"I've got to change that voice," Sean muttered to himself as he sat
down. "This one is just too demoralizing. Well, what have we got?" He
tabbed through the mail.
<p>
"Good, good, good--Ow! My poor singed eyeballs! Somebody sure
got their underwear in a twist over my security consultantship
marketing!" He peered at the return address. "Capsule Corporation, eh?
I don't know who the netadmin is, but he sure wields a mean
flamethrower. Idiot." Sean continued reading his e-mail for a while.
<p>
He sat back and sighed when he was done.  "Twelve 'thanks for the
info, we'll handle it ourselves', one temporary job--maybe, three
'we're still wrangling over the Convergence 95 committee
membership'--oops, how did those get into my VirtualBlack folder--"
Sean dumped the offending letters in the 'Goth Convergence' folder
where they belonged, "--one scorching flame-type rejection, and one
very interesting offer."  He pondered the last. "Someone wants a bit
of industrial espionage done. Against Capsule Corp. Hmmm." Sean smiled
grimly. "Wouldn't hurt to scout the perimeter, even if I don't decide
to step over the line."
<p>

<p>
A flickering yellow glow lit the tunnels of Hell, and something
slithered in the distance. No, some.. things, plural, Vegeta corrected
himself. There's more than one of them, I can feel it!
<p>
The warning given to Kakarott, Vegeta had departed Lankha and returned
to the path that he knew he must follow. Back, past Indrajit (who had
been nowhere to be found), to the Dire Wood and downwards into the
endless caverns again.  The Saiyan prince was getting very tired of
caves and tunnels.
<p>
Damn useful, those Rakshasa illusions. That damn demon could not sense
me except when I revealed myself to Kakarott--and I didn't give him
time to home in on me. Right under the bastard's nose--Hah! Vegeta
smiled cockily to himself. I'd forgotten how much I enjoy outwitting a
powerful opponent--it's been so long since I've had to.
<p>
Torches? Who is using torches? And WHY? Vegeta examined the stretch of
tunnel ahead of him.  Haven't any of these demon races heard of
electricity? Haven't any of them heard of any technology more advanced
than basic iron age? Or are they just too stupid to deal with more
than one moving part at a time? Feh.
<p>
Things slithered behind him, now, as well as ahead. Something blocked
the tunnel--a gate. Two floor to ceiling iron posts supported ornate
wooden panels, engraved with repeating patterns of serpents
entwined. Vegeta scowled and thrust out one hand--
<p>
And the gate opened before he could destroy it. Behind it
stood.. coiled?.. three strange figures.  In the center coiled what
appeared to be a monstrous snake from the tail to just short of its
head, where two powerful arms and broad shoulders emerged. The head
combined features of both man and cobra; a forked tongue flicked in
and out, testing the air.  The man-serpent held a broad-bladed, curved
sword in one hand, and wore golden mail over his shoulders and
partway down his body.  A gold, gem-studded crown adorned his head.
Beside him coiled two other man-serpents, in plain steel mail and
carrying short spears and shields.  Vegeta glanced behind; four more
snake-guards had appeared there, cutting off retreat.
<p>
"What are you?" snapped Vegeta.
<p>
"I," the center man-snake said haughtily, "am Vasuki, King of the
Nagas. You," the Naga king sneered, "are my prisoner and soon to be my
slave, fool!"
<p>
"Your what??" Vegeta nearly choked, though whether on laughter or rage
was not immediately obvious.
<p>
"You thought to escape your just sentence by escaping to the Middle
World as a ghost, didn't you?  A pity for you, evil one, that you
could not pass Indrajit the Invisible. It must have been a shock, when
he who reads all hearts confronted you!" The serpent king smiled
unpleasantly.
<p>
Vegeta threw back his head, and his laughter rang off the stone
walls. The Naga king drew back, unsmiling now, obviously disconcerted.
<p>
Abruptly Vegeta stopped laughing, and thrust one hand behind him. He
smiled evilly--
<p>
King Vasuki blinked his eyes rapidly, dazzled by the brilliant flash
of light that had appeared behind Vegeta. As the smoke cleared, and
his vision returned, the snake king saw to his dismay that his four
rear-guards had vanished, burned to a thin layer of soot by the
stranger.
<p>
Vegeta savored the Naga king's growing dismay. "Oh, yes, about
Indrajit--I defeated him, and have just returned from a pleasant visit
in Hidden Lankha." Vegeta smirked.
<p>
Just as the words registered in Vasuki's mind, Vegeta snapped forward
and slammed a fist into Vasuki's gut--or, what would have been his gut
except that snake ribs continue much further down than a
human's. Vasuki crashed into the far wall, cracking stone from the
impact. The wind was knocked out of him; he struggled to speak as his
two guards attacked Vegeta.
<p>
A flurry of blows, a crunching of bones, and two broken-backed snakes
writhed on the stone floor and grew still. Ghosts arose and departed;
the nagas were a living supernatural race of the underworld, and died
as men die. Vegeta turned back to King Vasuki.
<p>
"No.." the serpent king gasped. "Spare me!"  Vegeta gave him that evil
smile as he extended one hand.
<p>
"NOOOO! I give you my greatest treasure, if only you spare me!"
<p>
Vegeta paused. "What treasure of yours could I possibly want, snake?"
he asked with some irritation.
<p>
"My virgin daughter, laden with her bridal gold, is yours if you spare
me. My life is her brideprice," the old serpent pleaded, slithering
erect again.
<p>
"You would give your daughter to me? Her life mine, to do with as I
please, even kill her, in exchange for your own?" Vegeta's brows
lowered. How far would this weak fool go to save his life?
<p>
"Yessss! You have defeated Indrajit, and I accosted you foolishly,
thinking you weak--I apologize for so mistaking a great warrior. A
great warrior such as you would be a proper husband for my daughter
Kadru." He looked back over his shoulder. "Bring forth Princess
Kadru!" he called.
<p>
He is a fawning flatterer, and a weakling! I should kill him and his
daughter both! The Nagas should crown a more worthy king than this!
Let him bring out his daughter--then he will be surprised indeed when
I kill him!
<p>
From somewhere in the distance ahead, three more nagas slithered
towards the Naga King and Vegeta. Two of them were guards, but the
third! Her face was veiled, and an abbreviated gown adorned the upper
part of her serpentine body. From her head to just below her waist,
her form was very feminine. Gold and gems covered her--adorned her
veil, hung in necklaces around her neck, weighed down her arms,
beringed her fingers and belted her waist.
<p>
Princess Kadru slithered to a halt before her father, and bowed to
him. "I obey your command, Papa, and I am here." She sighed, and
regarded Vegeta with intense dark eyes.  The two guards with her
shifted nervously as they saw the remains of their comrades, and
glared at Vegeta with some hostility.
<p>
King Vasuki bowed obsequeously. "Daughter, I give you to this great
warrior, who has defeated Indrajit in combat, and visited the court in
Lankha. Honor me, and be obedient to him as is proper."  Vasuki
avoided looking at his daughter as he spoke.
<p>
"Who is this great warrior? Has he a name?" Kadru asked a bit tartly.
<p>
Vegeta's eyes widened in surprise. She does not fear me! Out of
ignorance, or... No. She is intelligent, and she saw the dead guards,
the damage to her father's armor--her eyes dart around, and she's
evaluating ME now. Vegeta smirked.
<p>
"I am Prince Vegeta of the Saiyajin, the greatest warrior ever born to
the Vegeta kings of Vegetasai!" he declared proudly.
<p>
Kadru's eyes widened. "Papa! You have found me a worthy husband!"
<p>
Vegeta smiled unpleasantly. "Too bad for you that I-- WHAT?"
<p>
King Vasuki vanished.  One second he was coiled against the wall, the
next he just slipped into the stone and was gone.
<p>
"PAPA!" Kadru's scream of rage and shame revealed her surprise.
<p>
"A coward and a weakling, but not a fool," Vegeta snarled. "He knew I
meant to kill him anyway!" He whirled to face the naga princess.
<p>
"I can't believe he did that to me! AIYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!" Kadru
keened at the top of her lungs, an incredibly loud sound in the
confined tunnel.
<p>
"BE SILENT, WOMAN!"
<p>
The keening abruptly stopped; Kadru looked at Vegeta, startled by his
shout. "I am sorry, husband, I forgot my place. It won't happen
again. It's just that I am so ashamed--Papa didn't have to be so
obvious about getting rid of me." Her lovely dark eyes brimmed with
tears.
<p>
Vegeta took a deep breath, several deep breaths--despite the fact that
he was dead and didn't need to breathe at all. "First, I AM NOT YOUR
HUSBAND! Second, you are either going to fade back through the wall to
your father, or I am going to kill you! Do you understand me?"
<p>
"I know that you think Papa cheated you," she said as she lowered her
veil to reveal her face, "because I am so plain, but I assure you I
will be a most excellent wife.  I have studied diligently all the arts
a good wife must know, as detailed in the sacred Sutras of Kama--"
<p>
"Plain?? How can I tell if you are plain or beautiful? You're a
snake! How do I know what looks good to another snake?" Vegeta
snapped.
<p>
Kadru looked hurt. "If it is my shape that displeases you, that can be
changed," she said as her serpentine form shimmered and shifted to
that of a two-legged green girl. "A talent I inherited from my
mother," she added modestly.
<p>
Hmmm.. Whoever told her she was plain was too picky to be judging
women! She's not bad looking--WHAT AM I THINKING??? I'm not here to
pick up snake-women!
<p>
"ALL the arts of Kama," she continued as if she'd never been
interrupted, "not merely the ones a man thinks of first. I weave and
embroider, dance, sing, play musical instruments, recite poetry, am a
diligent student of the sacred scriptures, an expert cook in all the
cuisines of the continent--"
<p>
"Cook?" She's a cook? I can't kill this girl! If she's half what she
claims, she's a treasure! "No matter. I already have a wife."  He
started to walk away.
<p>
"Oh, that will be no problem. I'm not one of those arrogant princesses
who will only suffer to be a first wife; I will be your second wife,
and serve your first wife as faithfully as I serve you! I assure you,
she will never have to labor in the household again, save as she
desires to, and I will be obedient to her in all things!" Kadru
followed the Saiyan prince.
<p>
Vegeta thought briefly of Bulma's probable reaction if he brought this
serpent-woman back with him and informed his mate that Kadru was to be
Vegeta's second wife and Bulma's new maid. His lips curved up in a
wry--very wry!--smile.
<p>
"No! Trust me, it wouldn't work."
<p>
"Then I am shameful and without honor--cast out by my father, rejected
by my husband-to-be. Who am I then?  No one, and nothing,
<i>adhamaadhama</i>.  I am an embarassment to my father--a princess, and
yet none will have me, because I am plain, and because they fear my
mother's heritage, yet Papa is too proud--or too greedy, which is a
shameful thing for me to say about my papa--to lower my
brideprice. You must have terrified him greatly that he accepted his
life as payment for me!"
<p>
Vegeta smirked at that. He was not overly interested in the domestic
tragedies of snakes, but one thing she'd said piqued his
curiousity. "What is your mother's heritage, and why does it scare
them?"
<p>
"My mother is a great princess, and a powerful sorceress--all
Naga-kind are, but the blood of Ravana runs in mother's veins, too,
from the days when the Demon King stole wives from among the wives and
daughters of all the supernatural races. So it is that I can change my
shape from naga to human to serpent, you see." She continued, "Mother
has very great.. appetites, and they proved too much for Papa. He
demanded a divorce after she ate his chancellor and tried to eat him."
<p>
Kadru sighed. "She demanded a very high price for the divorce, and
Papa spent a great deal of his treasure--though not all, as he holds
much of the Earth's wealth, almost as much as Vaishravana the Treasure
King--spent it building a palace for her and the golden causeway that
leads to it, Snake Way."
<p>
"Snake Way??" Vegeta exclaimed. "Then your mother..." Confound it, was
THAT who Kakarott made those cryptic comments about?
<p>
"..is Princess Snake." She blinked long lashes at him. "You have heard
of her!" Her lip trembled. "Is that why you won't claim me as your
wife? It's not true, I did not inherit her hunger, no matter what
anyone may have said. I'm no danger to your first wife or children, I
promise!"
<p>
"Woman, stop whining! I never heard of you until your father dumped
you on me!" Princess Snake's daughter, eh?  Now, what would Kakarott
say if I brought her back to be HIS second wife?
<p>
Vegeta couldn't help laughing at the image that thought conjured
up. The look on Kakarott's face would be priceless! Almost worth the
bother.. almost.  He shook his head.
<p>
"No! Just go back to your father!" Vegeta snarled, less viciously than
his usual wont.
<p>
"I cannot--it would shame Papa too much. There is nothing left for
me. I will not shame my father's name by living infamously, with
neither husband nor father nor brothers to protect my honor."
<p>
"What is that supposed to mean, woman?" Vegeta growled, getting very
tired of this snake-woman's carrying on. Idiotic woman--couldn't she
stand on her own two feet? Or tail, or whatever?  Bulma would never
have carried on like this--she'd just tell me what she thought of me,
and then do whatever the hell she pleased, with or without me, or her
father, or Kakarott, or anyone else!
<p>
"I will kill myself, of course. That way, I at least leave my family
without shame." She was curiously impassive.
<p>
"That's a solution!" Vegeta started to stalk off, and then paused, a
nasty thought coming to mind. He turned. "What happens when you die?"
<p>
Princess Kadru was smiling strangely. "My ghost will arise. Doubtless
I will follow the one who shamed me with his rejection, wailing and
lamenting, forever."
<p>
"I could just kill you myself."
<p>
"Even more so would I follow the one who shamed me AND murdered me!"
<p>
"I would break your spirit."
<p>
"I would return. There is a power that sustains the wronged dead in
their vengeance."
<p>
"You're threatening me!" Vegeta seemed shocked.
<p>
"If that is the only way, yes!" Kadru resumed her Naga form. "All I
require is an honorable marriage. I do not ask that you love me, or
even like me. I have no brothers, and my father has given me to you."
She shrugged.
<p>
Vegeta scowled and almost said something--then checked himself
abruptly. He looked at the Naga princess speculatively. "You don't
need me," Vegeta said in a matter-of-fact way.
<p>
"Yes, I do! I must have a husband!" She slithered after him,
determined.
<p>
"You certainly think so!" Vegeta snapped. "You want a husband. *A*
husband.. any husband" he emphasized, "but not me."
<p>
Comprehension dawned. "You are rather unpleasant," she conceded. "You
will find me a suitable husband, then," Kadru said confidently.
<p>
"I'll what?? Woman, have you lost your little snakey mind?"
<p>
"It is the only reasonable solution. As far as Papa knows, you are my
husband, thus there is no shame to him in my accompanying you to find
a real husband." She looked sidelong at Vegeta. "Conduct yourself
toward me as a brother, and there will be no shame to me, either."
<p>
At least she is wise enough not to remind me of her previous
threat--though it still stands; I can see it in her eyes. I don't
believe this! The Prince of the Saiyajin, outwitted by this silly
snake-woman?? Bah!
<p>
Well, if she stays alive and unmarried until I get back to Earth,
there's always Raditz... Vegeta smiled darkly.
<p>
"Don't expect me to wait for you," was all Vegeta said as he stalked
off.

"Hey, you hard-wired to that computer, or what?" Melchior asked
Sean. He was skinny, geeky-looking kid in black jeans and black
T-shirt with hair dyed green, three earrings per ear, a nose stud, and
two eyebrow rings over his left eye. "Come on, take a breather--you're
turning into a web zombie."
<p>
"Don't you guys ever knock?" Sean asked, rubbing his eyes and turning
away from the computer he'd been hunched over for hours.
<p>
"Not since you gave me a key," Pomona answered cheerily, waving the
aforementioned object. "Melc is right--you need a break." She waved a
hand in front of his face. "Uh-huh, having trouble focusing on
something more than half a meter away, aren't you?"
<p>
"Yeah, okay." Sean pushed his chair back and stood up, brushing his
black hair out of his eyes. "I guess I am a bit hungry." He looked
around at the pile of empty Coke cans and candy wrappers on his
desk. "For real food."
<p>
"And you'll need some exercise to come down from that caffiene buzz
before you can even think of sleeping! We've got just the place!"
Pomona looped her arm in Sean's and all but dragged him toward the
door.
<p>
"What? Where?" Sean blinked at the pink-haired goth girl.
<p>
She giggled. "Silly, 'The club, Elwood, the club!' What did you
think? Floodland, of course!"
<p>
The new girl stuck her head in the door and added, "Melchior's going
to spin some classics for me to dance to--Sisters of Mercy, The Cure,
and so on." Sinhika Manohara winked at Sean.
<p>
Sean swallowed hard and ran for his room, for a quick cold shower and
a change of clothes. He'd first seen the drop-dead gorgeous Indian
girl with the orange hair a week ago--well, *everyone* had seen
her--at the grand re-opening of Floodland, the night club that had
been smashed flat by a berserk demon some months ago.
<p>
At first, she'd been just another face in the crowd.. then the dance
floor started to clear around her, as the other club-goers backed away
to watch, awestruck. She danced like no one but herself was there to
watch, like the music reached in and possessed her, driving her to a
frenzy.  And how she danced! Supple and graceful, rhythm and
sensuality incarnate, exotic and classical, all in one tireless
body--Sinhika's dances rapidly became known as the best unofficial
show in the club.

<p>
Raditz looked both ways, and up, and around. He hated it when Bulma
went downtown--too many people, too many directions for danger to
appear from. He'd sense it if something powerful (like the demon that
killed Vegeta) appeared, but Bulma was so weak, and untrained as
well. A mere human with a weapon could kill her, if he wanted to!
<p>
He'd said something about it, once--just once! Bulma had snapped at
him, "If you must be my personal bodyguard, you're just going to have
to adapt to MY life; I'm NOT going to spend the rest of it living in a
bunker just because you think it isn't safe! If you don't like it,
tough!"
<p>
Fortunately for both of them, Raditz felt none of the embarassment a
human male would have felt at accompanying Bulma into various women's
boutiques. As far as he was concerned, they were just more human
merchants, and their shops were somewhat less dangerous than the open
street.
<p>
Raditz wished she wouldn't ask his opinion all the time, though. Bulma
knew very well what she looked good in--at least, everything she'd
picked out had been very.. distracting.  Especially that tight red
dress with the low back!
<p>
"Well, what do you think?" She popped out of the dressing room with
the saleslady in tow, and turned slowly, modelling the red dress. She
smirked at Raditz's reaction.  "Perfect! Wait until Vegeta sees me in
this!"
<p>
Raditz wiped the sweat off his forehead. When did it get so hot in
here?  As far as he was concerned, Bulma would look great in a potato
sack--or better yet, nothing at all...
<p>
WHOA, RADITZ! She's Vegeta's MATE, you moron! Your PRINCE, remember?
But he's dead, and I'm not.. But he'll be back.. or will he? The
chances aren't good.. But Bulma's so confident that he'll be back all
of a sudden.. why?  Maybe Kakarott knows something; I'll have to ask
him. In the meantime.. I hope she's about done with those
tight.. revealing.. incredibly sexy dresses that make it so easy to
imagine what she looks like without any-- ARRGGGHHH! I'm doing it
again!
<p>
Raditz stepped outside. I can wait out here for her, there's no danger
to Bulma in that shop--except from me. He was surprised to see that it
was dark already. Across the street, a crowd gathered, forming a line
in front of some other arcane shop or business. "Floodland", the sign
proclaimed; apparently it was not yet open (whatever it was), but
eagerly anticipated by the young men and women out front.
<p>
Raditz watched the crowd; such gatherings made him nervous about
Bulma, and he was already on edge. The girl doing backflips and a
cartwheel caught his eye.  Orange hair, dusky skin, very
nice-looking.. seemed to be warming up for something. She stretched
and ran through what looked to Raditz like some type of kata, or
combat training form. He frowned; his professional paranoia kicked in.
<p>
Yes--he could sense some power about her! Not much, but more than the
rest of these weaklings--and if she could hide her power like
Kakarott.. Raditz watched the orange-haired girl closely, with an
occasional glance around to make sure he wasn't being distracted from
the main attack, if there was one.
<p>
With paranoia in high gear, it didn't take the long-maned Saiyan long
to notice the others watching him. There was a small knot of three or
four people standing near the athletic girl, watching him. They all
wore black--some kind of uniform?--and more jewelry than Raditz had
noticed on other humans.  Two men had coal-black hair, one had green
hair, and the girl had pink hair. And they were talking about him.
<p>
Raditz smirked to himself; one thing he'd learned already, human
ears weren't nearly as sensitive as Saiyan ears. Humans frequently
thought themselves to be whispering in private when Raditz could hear
them just fine.  He focused on the conversation across the street,
tuning out the traffic noise and general murmur.
<p>
"Who's the big goon across the street?" said the tall, well-built man
with black hair. "He's new.."
<p>
"Not a tourist, not wearing that Capsule Corp jacket!" answered the
scrawny weakling with the green hair. "Definitely a fashion
victim--jeans and a corporate logo jacket? Yecch!"
<p>
"I wouldn't say 'yecch' to that bod, Melc! And look at that HAIR!
Yum!" The pink-haired girl in the very short black skirt looked at
Raditz in a very frank, almost predatory way. "Nice face, too--he'd be
downright handsome if he wasn't scowling."
<p>
Green-hair reconsidered. "You're right--get him some decent clothes
and I wouldn't be saying 'no', either! He's built like.. well, he's
built!"
<p>
"Only if he swings your way, Melchior," the pink-haired girl smiled
mockingly. "Be just my luck if he did," she pouted.
<p>
"Hey, maybe we'll both get lucky and he goes both ways." Melchior
shrugged. "It could happen."
<p>
The tall black-haired man glared at Raditz. "With that build, he's
probably a brainless jock," he sneered. Something in his tone, and the
way he stood close to the pink-haired girl suggested jealousy to
Raditz.
<p>
What a strange group of humans! Well, maybe not so strange, Raditz
thought as he remembered some long-ago barracks room conversations
about this or that Saiyan girl.  But still..! To have a bunch of
humans discussing HIM as if he were some strong, good-looking Saiyan
woman who might be willing..! He wasn't sure whether he should be
amused, or insulted.  At least they weren't plotting an attack on
Bulma or himself.
<p>
Raditz's mouth curved up in a hint of a smile. Bulma had been right;
human women (and some men) found him very attractive!
<p>
"Woo-hoo! He's smiling! Told ya! He's not just handsome, he's
gorgeous!" the pink-haired girl crowed to her companions, who now
included the orange-haired girl, done with her exercises. She watched
him intently, interest plain on her face.
<p>
"Doesn't look like he's coming to the club," she said in a sultry
voice that Raditz had to strain to hear. "What a shame! I'd like to
get to know him!"
<p>
"In the biblical sense?" queried the tall jealous man sardonically.
<p>
"Maybe," the orange-haired girl smiled, and sashayed into the now-open
club door.
<p>
About that time, Bulma finally emerged from the shop, loaded with
packages; Raditz reluctantly turned away.
<p>

<p>
The only good thing about this hell, Vegeta thought, was that he was
out of those endless damn caves! An icy wind blew over barren hills
and through dark canyons as they picked their way ever downward. Kadru
was blue-lipped and shivering, and even Vegeta could feel the cold. He
cursed it.
<p>
"<i>Nande kuso</i>? I am DEAD, damn it! Why should I be cold?" He leaped down
to the bottom of the current ravine, and, contrary to his earlier
harsh words, waited for Kadru.
<p>
Princess Kadru shifted to human form; this ravine was too steep, she
needed both hands and both feet. "I don't know, I've never experienced
anything like this. I've read about it, though. It is winter, I
think--a supernatural, eternal winter."
<p>
"Supernatural winter, supernatural cold--so they freeze the damned
here instead. Wonderful." Vegeta's voice was flat.
<p>
"If it's any consolation, not-husband, the living are also freezing
here," Kadru responded mildly.
<p>
"I said I'd find you a husband; I didn't promise to keep you
comfortable or alive." Vegeta considered. "If you were dead, I
wouldn't have to worry about keeping you alive." At her angry look, he
smirked. "I won't kill you--I don't need your ghost haunting me all
the way back home--but try not to have any accidents, and don't freeze
to death!"
<p>
The ravine opened out into a larger canyon, with a stone-paved road in
the center, leading down around a bend.
<p>
"Down that road," pointed Vegeta, "is the Gioll Bridge. We cross it,
and follow the river to Naastrand."
<p>
Kadru looked at him in some surprise. "You know this place?"
<p>
"Only by legend. We are in Niflheim." Vegeta continued down the road;
Kadru shifted to Naga form and slithered after him.
<p>
Ahead of her, Vegeta stopped suddenly, and dropped into fighting
stance. "What is it?" Kadru started ask, and then stopped abruptly.
<p>
Just around the bend, at the very end of a huge iron chain, thick as a
ship's anchor chain, crouched a monstrous hound. It was twice the size
of an elephant, covered with thick hair, chest matted with blood. It
crouched, snarling at Vegeta, baring gigantic teeth like knives. Torn
and rotting fragments of flesh and bone lay scattered about.
<p>
Vegeta answered with one word: "Garm."

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<CENTER><P>CONTINUED IN CHAPTER X. THE MOONSTOP</P></CENTER>

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Moon">X. THE MOONSTOP</A></H1>
<p>
White fire crackled and flared around Vegeta as he gathered power. The
ground shook; small pebbles and dust rose into the air; the incessant
cold wind stopped, and the air grew pungent with ozone.
<p>
Before Vegeta, the monstrous hound Garm crouched, baring ivory fangs
the size of swords. It laid its ears back, and crouched lower as power
raged around Vegeta. Its deep growl rose in pitch, and it shook its
head from side to side, ears pained by the seething energies around
Vegeta.
<p>
Kadru backed away, looking for cover that wasn't floating away in the
vortex of Vegeta's power.  She shifted to two-legged, human form and
climbed the canyon wall to a sheltered ledge, then turned to watch.
<p>
Suddenly, all fell silent as Vegeta gathered the power in; rocks fell
to the ground, and the cold wind blew as before.  Garm snapped at
Vegeta as he rose into the air--Vegeta dodged with ease.
<p>
The Saiyan prince glared into Garm's eyes, wide, dark Saiyan eyes
locked with huge, amber beast's eyes--and realized something.  He
laughed.
<p>
"You're a dog! A very large, ugly, vicious, supernatural dog, but
still just a dog! Look at me, you stupid thing! I am the prince of the
Saiyajin, greatest of warriors--and YOU are just a dog!" Vegeta
levitated just above the monster-hound's eyes, almost standing on its
nose. He crossed his arms and continued to stare Garm down.
<p>
Garm growled, a deep thundering sound that reverberated off the
canyon walls. Its ears were flat against his head as it tensed.
<p>
Faster than Garm could see, Vegeta moved. CRACK! Garm's head rocked as
the Saiyan prince slammed the side of his muzzle--and then resumed his
position, glaring down at Hel's hound. Energy gathered in his left hand.
<p>
The monster growled in rage and lunged again--WHOOM! Garm fell back,
howling and pawing his singed, smoking nose. Vegeta laughed, never
looking away from the dog-monster; Garm growled in rage and hate, but
this time, another note crept in, an uncertain whine.
<p>
"Yes, you ARE a dog--an animal! I am a MAN--learn that now, dog! I'm
not patient with disobedient.. pets."  He continued to glare at Hel's
guard beast.
<p>
Garm whined, and finally dropped its eyes, unable to meet the hot dark
gaze of the Saiyan any longer.  It tucked its tail and slunk away,
growling dire promises of revenge, getting as far as the chain would
allow from the prince who had no fear of Garm.
<p>
Vegeta smiled with satisfaction. He turned his head. "Kadru! Are you a
bird, now, that you nest on cliffs? Get down here, snake-woman,
or be left behind!"
<p>
Kadru crept fearfully past the sullen hound as Vegeta strode
confidently down the road. At the bottom of the deepest canyon, the
road crossed a dark cold river--the Gioll River of Niflheim. Even in
the shadows of that icy hell the golden roof of the Gioll Bridge
glimmered, beckoning the travellers onward.
<p>
"It's warm!" Kadru suddenly exclaimed. "I can feel the heat coming off
of it!"
<p>
Vegeta soon saw why--the glimmering roof burned, gold burning with a
perpetual, unnatural fire.  The figure of an armored warrior maiden
stood at attention, spear in hand, silhouetted by the fiery
roof. "Hmmph. At least it keeps off that accursed icy wind!" he
growled as he rubbed his stiff muscles.
<p>
Princess Kadru gasped as they neared the bridge and its guardian. The
warrior maiden was not so pretty up close; a skeletal guardian,
braided blond hair still clinging to her otherwise bare, grinning
skull. Bits of dried flesh still webbed arm bones and hands together,
but it was a dead thing that stood there.
<p>
"Ugly thing. She's going to have an even harder time finding a husband
than you are, Kadru," Vegeta remarked, looking the silent, still
guardian up and down.
<p>
"Why? Are you volunteering?"
<p>
Vegeta started and Kadru jumped as the skeletal guardian spoke with a
deep, yet feminine voice, not unpleasant to the ear, with a hint of
amusement in it. Empty sockets in the bare skull regarded Vegeta.
<p>
"A bit short for my tastes--and I warrant you'd not be so pretty if
you appeared here in your death wounds and decay as all Hel's subjects
are supposed to."
<p>
"I'm not one of Hel's subjects!" Prince Vegeta snapped. "Who are you,
and what are you doing here?"
<p>
"You're dead, and you're here, that makes you one of Hel's subjects
whether you like it or not. What Hel gets, she keeps. As for the
formalities.." an audible sigh escaped the skeletal jaws, "I am
Modgudh, guard of the Gioll Bridge.  Who are you, and what is your
business in Niflheim?"
<p>
Vegeta crossed his arms and scowled. "I am Prince Vegeta of the
Saiyajin, and my business is my own!"
<p>
"Short, handsome, noble, and ill-tempered as Garm with sore paw--what
an <i>interesting</i> combination!" Modgudh chuckled, a disconcerting
sound. "And you?" Modgudh turned to Kadru. "I mark you as living--no
ghost ever made that much of a racket clomping down from Garm's
Bend--but what do you here?"
<p>
"I did NOT clomp!" Kadru protested. "I'm just not used to feet, that's
all." As Modgudh continued to stare eyelessly at her, Kadru continued,
startled, "Oh. Yes. I'm Princess Kadru, daughter of King Vasuki of the
Naga People, and I'm looking for a husband. Prince Vegeta, my
not-husband, is escorting me."
<p>
Modgudh turned briefly back to Vegeta. "Not-husband? That's a new
one." She turned to Kadru once again. "You're looking for a
husband.. in Niflheim. Girl, unless your tastes run to god-devouring
wolves or the shades of murderers, adulterers and cowards, you are
seriously lost."
<p>
"We're not planning on a long stay," Vegeta commented dryly. "Seen any
large, out-of-place demons rampage through here lately?"
<p>
Modgudh's skull swiveled back towards Vegeta again. "And your business
here is...?"
<p>
Vegeta unfolded his arms. "Vengeance!"
<p>
"Against a large, out-of-place demon?"
<p>
"Something like that. I'm looking for its trail: it's violent,
destructive, and foul; its followers are goat-demon-things called
broo.  Are they here?" Vegeta demanded to know.
<p>
"Foulness ever rises from the fount of frigid Elivagar; its poison
taints all the giant races with evil. As for your broo demons, hard to
say--this is Niflheim, where the dead giants and mound-dwellers walk
as well as damned human ghosts. There are many unseelie things in this
realm." Modgudh leaned on her spear.
<p>
"Where is Elivagar?"
<p>
Modgudh pointed silently upstream.
<p>
"And Naastrand, where the ship Nailfarer Naglfar lies?"
<p>
Modgudh pointed downstream.
<p>
"I don't believe this! Twice over, and probably get nowhere!" Vegeta
gritted his teeth. "Come on, woman!" The Saiyan prince crossed the
bridge, Modgudh stepping aside to let him pass.  Vegeta turned to
follow the river--upstream.
<p>

<p>
On Earth, Sinhika Manohara slipped away from the late night crowd. She
loved to dance, but some of the people--ick! Well, Sean was vaguely
interesting, but the rest of them.. forget it. She turned down the
alley beside the club, dodging the boys on the street.
<p>
She heard footsteps behind her, and glanced back. Oh, great, that
Voron cretin was following her around again!  Not only was he a
self-centered, pretentious twit, but.. Sinhika stepped around a
corner, and disappeared.
<p>
Voron ("rhymes with moron", Pomona had once snidely remarked to
Sinhika) stopped, baffled. She couldn't have just disappeared into
thin air! Damn! She was perfect, too--if he could just get her to
listen, to understand.. He sighed, shrugged, and turned back.
<p>
Hovering invisibly twenty feet up, Princess Sinhika the Rakshasa
watched him go. She smiled to herself; <i>Akritaatmaanul</i>! Clueless
idiot! She rose into the sky, listening, looking, scenting the night
air--this was her time, night and darkness, and she loved it! She came
to rest on an upper ledge of a skyscraper, looking down at the city
lights.
<p>
Beautiful! It's not Beautiful Lankha of course, but it has an appeal
all its own. So many people, all going every which way, all with their
own private destinies. I wonder which ones are tied to that of the
Ghost Prince?  She wondered if any other Night Wanderers were in the
city--she hadn't noticed any of her fellow rakshasas, but that hardly
meant anything in such a metropolis.
<p>
!!!
<p>
What was that?  It felt like--it was! The ancient duty pulled at her;
someone or something had desecrated--was desecrating!--a holy place,
and not far! "<i>Akaaryuum</i>! Someone has done something foul!" Sinhika
growled to herself, and took to the air, her power veiled in illusion
and invisibility.
<p>
Sinhika alighted invisibly on the gateposts of an old Shinto
temple. Keen eyes noted the broken door, keen ears heard rude voices
raised inside, and an old man pleading. She darted inside, unseen and
unheard.
<p>
Two--no, three--punks pushed an old man around. Tables were overturned
and images broken.  One young thug, unshaven street riff-raff dressed
in tattered fatigues and vest, held the old man while another punk
in dirty camo-pattern T-shirt and fatigues punched him in the
stomach.
<p>
"Aw, this old priest is a wimp! No fun beating him up! Let's just get
this over with," the thug in the vest complained.
<p>
The third thug, a muscular fellow in dark jeans and tight black shirt,
replied, "Yeah, knock it off, Shiru. You'll get your jollies when he's
sacrificed.  Bring him along!"
<p>
Shiru, the thug in the camo-shirt, shrugged. "Hey, just having a
little fun fer starters, you know.  Think Keikan-Ma will give us a
bonus for bringing in a priest and trashing a temple?"
<p>
"THERE IS NOTHING BUT DEATH FOR DEFILERS!" boomed an inhumanly deep
voice.  The three thugs looked up, paralyzed by the sight of one of
the two carved shrine guardians coming to life and rising from its
pedestal.
<p>
"OH SHIT! RUN FOR IT!" The muscular thug did the only sensible thing,
and bolted into the night.
<p>
"That's impossible!" Shiru gaped at the apparition, fist still
clenched for another swing at the old priest. His partner stared
dumbly, still holding the old man.  They should have run.
<p>
The reality of it finally reached Shiru far too late as the monstrous
guardian demon lashed out with a taloned hand and tore out Shiru's
throat. His partner let go of the old priest and turned to run, again
too late as a taloned hand caught him by the back of the neck.
<p>
It was over in less than a minute. The guardian demon glared in the
direction the third defiler had gone, and growled gently to the
priest, "That one will not escape his fate. Cleanse this place, and be
calm; no righteous man need fear me."  The demon vanished into the
night, carrying the two corpses with it.
<p>
On a nearby rooftop, Sinhika dropped her burden. "<i>Akritabuddhitvaah</i>;
stupidity is my only excuse. Letting the third guy escape--dumb,
Sinhika, dumb!" She shook her head. "And I really have to come up with
better lines than that! Verbal and visual have to work
together--'There is nothing but death for defilers!' sounded so lame!
Hmmm... Maybe a simple 'Die, scum!' next time?  If there is a next
time, which I hope not, but.." She shook her head again. "I don't like
that talk about sacrificing the priest.. and who--or WHAT--is
Keikan-Ma?  That isn't a real name; it literally means 'police demon',
'law enforcer demon', or something like that.  I really don't like
this..."
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Late the next afternoon, the phone woke Sinhika from a deep
sleep. "Huh? What?"
<p>
"It's me, Pomona. You still asleep? Wake up; it's five in the
afternoon already! Look, we're trying to pry Sean off the computer
again and drag him out to dinner; you coming?"
<p>
Sinhika yawned. "No, I couldn't. I had a huge dinner late last
night. I'm stuffed; I simply couldn't eat another.. thing today."
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"Fine, that's it for today! Go ahead and take the rest of the day off;
we'll catch up on the rest of it tomorrow." Bulma shooed her executive
assistant out of the office, and closed the door. At last! She was
done with all those annoying humdrum business details; it was time for
some fun.. er, research.
<p>
Down in the lab, Bulma logged into her "special" server, and started
working.
<p>
"Oh, yes, you couldn't resist the bait, could you?" Bulma chuckled
evilly as she studied her honeypot's logs. "One nasty flame or two,
and you just had to come back to prove what a bad boy you were, didn't
you, VirtualBlack? Let's see what you've been up to..."
<p>
Later..
<p>
"Hmmm. No serious penetrations, no damage done.." she muttered to
herself, "just sniffing around--wait a minute! That personal node in
Security--I recognize those files! What in the hell are my Saiyan tech
manuals doing there?? Whose computer was that... RADITZ!!! YOU IDIOT!
You worked on those manuals on a damn clerical node! Didn't Hiregumi
brief you on system security?"
<p>
Bulma worked hurriedly. "Not good--VirtualBlack got enough to give the
show away, if he has a clue about what he's got." She gritted her
teeth. "Let's see what Dr. Brief's little girl can do to salvage the
situation.. and when I see that long-haired, long-tailed IDIOT of a
Saiyan, I will PERSONALLY give him that security briefing--with a tire
iron!!"
<p>
She laughed abruptly. "VirtualBlack! You're still on-line!  Wonderful!
I KNOW WHERE YOU ARE!!" She quickly entered the requisite commands,
and paused, her finger hovering over the confirm button. Bulma smiled
as evilly as Vegeta ever did right before a kill--and her finger
stabbed down.
<p>
The attack programs began their work, targetting VirtualBlack's
computer and its precious, stolen data--and setting in motion events
that would fling open the gates of Hell.
<p>

<p>
In frigid Niflheim, Vegeta continued to curse the cold. He flew now,
carrying Kadru in his arms, spending precious ki to pass over the
deepening snow--and the power that should have warmed him, that
allowed him to defy any earthly chill, did nothing to blunt the icy
wind that knifed through him. It took all his concentration just to
keep flying. As for Kadru...
<p>
He glanced down at her. "What? This is not good." Her lips were blue, and
face pale; Kadru shivered violently, continuously. "Don't die on me,
snake-woman! You'll be just as cold as a ghost, I can tell you that."
<p>
"Tired," she mumbled petulantly. "Just want to sleep..." Kadru's eyes
closed; blowing snow started to cover her face.
<p>
"<i>Kuso</i>! This is very not good!" Prince Vegeta looked around--there
had to be some kind of shelter around here--Yes! Up on that ridge,
overlooking the river.. a cave! He swooped toward it.
<p>
He skimmed over the icefall at the entrance and flew on, into the
cave. A bend or two, and the icy wind was left behind--only a
stagnant, life-sapping cold remained to remind them of the eternal
winter without. Vegeta set the Naga-princess down on dry rock, and
looked around.
<p>
"Damn this cold! There's got to be something that will burn around
here!" he snarled, cold, tired and frustrated.
<p>
"NO--BUT THERE'S HOT BLOOD TO DRINK!" Something large rumbled as it
slouched out of the back of the cave. Twice or more the height of a
man, massively muscled--though now those muscles were shrivelled black
from long freezing and rotting, ugly, decaying, dead; the shade of
some troll or other giantkin shambled forward, eager for fresh
meat. It carried no weapon, but spread great clawed hands out to grab
and crush.
<p>
Vegeta leaped forward to the attack--and nearly stumbled into the
thing's grasp. His eyes went wide; he was too slow and stiff--the
damned cold! The undead troll lunged forward, unslowed by the cold it
was born to, and grabbed Vegeta's leg.
<p>
The troll tensed rotting muscles and slammed Vegeta hard against the
cave wall, stunning him. It shifted its grip, grabbing the Saiyan by his hair
with its other hand, and dragged him up face-to-decaying-skull. The
monster scrutinized him closely.
<p>
"NO FLESH TO DEVOUR, NO BONES TO CRACK!" It howled its disappointment,
and flung Vegeta heavily against the wall. It ignored the discarded
Saiyan ghost, and sniffed the air. "I SMELL LIVING MEAT!" It hooted,
and lumbered toward the unconscious Princess Kadru.
<p>
"<i>Chikusho</i>! I am the Prince of the Saiyajin, not your unwanted
dinner! You should not turn your back on me!" Vegeta screamed his rage
as power enveloped him, warmed him, turned him to flaming gold.
<p>
"Good. There WAS something that would burn around here." observed
Vegeta, one blast later. He returned to his normal form, hair fading
from gold to black again--and nearly staggered in exhaustion. Going
Super-Saiyan had drained most of his remaining energy. "Still not
good. DAMN THIS COLD!"
<p>
He dragged the unconscious snake-princess over next to the burning
troll. "Kadru?"  She did not respond, and was cold to the touch. Very
carefully, he drew a hand back and slapped her repeatedly, rocking her
head from side to side with the force of the blows.
<p>
"Huh? Go 'way. Let me sleep.." she finally mumbled.
<p>
"Stupid snake-wench!" Vegeta snarled, slapping her harder than ever. A
split lip bled, and Kadru finally awakened fully.
<p>
"STOP! Why are you hurting me?" she started to cry.
<p>
"I cannot warm you, stupid snake! If you'd rather freeze to death, go
back to sleep! If not, pull yourself up to the fire and get warm!"
Vegeta snapped.
<p>
"Oh." She crouched over the fire. "Phewww. What is that SMELL??"
<p>
"Barbecued troll mummy, I think."
<p>
Kadru finally looked at what was burning. "EEYECCH!" She backed away
from the fire, felt the stagnant cold waiting for her, and sidled back
to the fire. "That's disgusting!"
<p>
"It burns."
<p>
"It burns disgustingly." She frowned, and added pragmatically, "At
least it is warm."
<p>
Maybe she has one tiny iota of common sense, thought Vegeta.
Warmth.. I never thought I'd need something so simple so badly. This
damned, cursed cold! It's been sapping my strength since we entered
Niflheim, and I never noticed! I've very little energy left, and
getting it back won't be easy.. only two peaches left. No point in
eating one until I figure out how to keep this infernal cold from
draining all my energy away again. Damn this!
<p>
"I wish I had a coat," Kadru muttered, as a pale light washed in from
outside.
<p>
"What kind of coat would protect you from THIS cold?" Vegeta retorted
as he made his way back to the mouth of the cave. He peered over the
icefall, and gasped.
<p>
A great half-moon spun across the sky--only to Vegeta's eyes, it
seemed that sometimes the moon shimmered and became a pale glowing
goddess. It was not alone--pursuing the moon, snapping at the
goddess's heels was a great white wolf, big as a mountain. Now and
then its feet touched down as it bounced itself off the ground for a
faster jump, nearly catching the fleeing lunar orb. It gamboled across
the sky; snow and ice glittered in the air as it shook the hoarfrost
from its fur.
<p>
"So.. 'god-devouring wolves' was no jest..." Vegeta glanced back into the
cave, and turned to watch the giant wolf. "What kind of coat, indeed!
For supernatural cold, a supernatural fur coat." Prince Vegeta
smirked, and hastened back to the fire.
<p>
"You said you knew all the arts of a good wife, snake-woman. Can you
sew?" Vegeta asked as he pulled out the next-to-last peach.
<p>
Kadru blinked. "Of course! Sew, embroider, weave.. why do you ask?"
<p>
Vegeta bit into the juicy peach, savoring its flavor. "I'm certainly
not going to sew that coat you wished for! It's going to be enough
trouble getting the fur." He ate all the peach but one bite, and
glared at Kadru.
<p>
"Here." Prince Vegeta shoved the last bit of peach into her
hands. "Get your strength back, you'll have to survive the next bit on
your own."
<p>
Kadru took it. "Thank you, not-husband." She quickly ate the last
bite, and stopped, eyes wide.  "What is this?  I feel so.. good. I'm
not tired at all, and almost warm, and so strong.. it is so sweet!"
<p>
Vegeta chuckled, amused at her reaction to the Peach of--he stopped
chuckling as he remembered--IMMORTALITY! Raditz's words came back to
him: "those are the Peaches of Immortality--too bad the immortality
part only works for the living and for gods." Princess Kadru was
LIVING! What had he just done?
<p>
Vegeta leaned his head in his hands. "Snake-woman, you have the most
unbelievably stupid good luck!" He sighed. "I have a wolf to
kill. Wait here."
<p>
Burning gold, Prince Vegeta flew out of the cave mouth to confront
Hati, the wolf who hunted the moon.
<p>

<p>
"All right! This is looking good, real good," Raditz reported through
the prototype scouter's comm link. The long-haired Saiyan stood
patiently while Bulma and another technician checked over his
prototype armor. "Hey, it's just fine, I've worn and adjusted enough
armor in my time to know when it is done right!"
<p>
"Raditz, I'm checking the telemetry leads, not the fit!" Bulma
snapped, a bit exasperated. "Your personal evaluations are nice, but
they don't tell me how fast you're going, or how many joules of energy
are being tossed about. I want hard data on how this holds up."
<p>
"Crud! I'm just going to be flying around a bit, not picking a fight
with Frieza's second cousin or whatever!"
<p>
"That's not funny, Raditz!" Bulma growled. "You weren't there when
cyborged Frieza and his father showed up--one of the more terrifying
days of my life."
<p>
"Sorry I missed it, but I was dead at the time--down in Hell with all
my family and friends that Frieza murdered."
<p>
"You're right, you do have a natural talent for being annoying!" Bulma
yanked viciously at an innocent lead near Raditz's tail, almost
pulling it loose. "Everything's secure, we're ready."
<p>
"I told you that already."
<p>
Bulma glared murderously at Raditz, but said nothing.
<p>
"Can I take off now, without you taking an iron bar to my head?"
<p>
"You had that coming."
<p>
"So I didn't pay that much attention to Hiregumi's lecture on computer
security--I'm here to protect you from real enemies, not nitwits with
computers and too much time on their hands. My mistake; I didn't know
the translation stuff could get stolen like that." Raditz shrugged,
the closest he ever came to an apology to Bulma.
<p>
"Go! We'll be monitoring channels 1, 3 and 4, and I'll be privately
monitoring channel 2, got that?"
<p>
Raditz nodded in the affirmative as he rose into the air, clad in the
black bodysuit and hard white shell of the new Capsule Corp prototype
armor.  The familiar corona of energy enveloped him, and Raditz surged
through the air, eager to push the new armor to its, and his, limits.
The half-moon was just starting to rise; the merest sliver of it
peeked over the horizon.
<p>

<p>
Vegeta plunged through the deadly cold air in a high arc, descending
on the great wolf. He debated for a moment whether or not to take
ouzaru form, but then the moon-goddess turned to face him full on,
ending the debate with his change. Super-saiyan Vegeta became
super-saiyan ouzaru Vegeta, and Hati took notice.
<p>
The giant white wolf, not quite the size of a mountain after all--only
twice the size of ouzaru Vegeta, turned, snarling.  The burning golden
ape smashed into the white wolf, knocking the beast sprawling--but the
wolf snapped teeth of ice shut on Vegeta's left wrist, pulling him
down with it. Together they skidded across the sky, a tumbling ball of
blazing gold and silver white; the moon stopped to watch.
<p>
Vegeta locked his right hand around the wolf's throat; in return the
wolf raked his stomach with its hard blunt hind nails. They finally
tumbled to a stop against a mountainside; the golden ape pinned the
monster wolf against the mountain with his knees and squeezed its
throat ever more tightly while fighting to free his hand from the
wolf's mouth. The wolf in its turn bit down on the captive wrist, but
could not tear it off.
<p>
The ape bellowed his rage; he couldn't blast the great wolf without
losing his own hand! Still his other hand tightened, while his left
hand froze, crushed in the dread wolf's icy jaws.  The wolf thrashed
weakly now, its titanic strength fading--and then Vegeta twisted with
all his strength, left hand dragging the clenched jaws around to
follow the right hand.
<p>
CRACK! Hati went limp as its neck broke, and ouzaru Vegeta watched
wide-eyed as a ghostly wolf arose, and howled dolefully at the moon it
had once hunted. Then, without a backward glance, it trotted into the
sky, to become one with the stars. The moon turned away from its
former tormentor, and drifted a bit higher, no longer fleeing its
dread pursuer.
<p>
The golden ape pried its hand from the dead wolf's jaws with some
difficulty, and carried the great carcass back to the cave mouth
before the moon turned away too far, and super-ouzaru reverted to
super-saiyan.
<p>
Princess Kadru came to the cave mouth and marvelled, and then gave her
own advice. "Warrior, drink the wolf's blood, and eat of the heart,
for there you will find its power!"
<p>
Later, after Kadru and Vegeta had eaten their fill of wolf meat
(including wolf heart) roasted over wolf's bones (the troll long since
having burned out and wandered away to sulk), Kadru proved her
skills. By sorcery she tanned the fur, and by skill made it into a
coat, mittens and boots for herself, a fine high-collared fur cloak
for Vegeta, and fur linings for his boots and gloves.  The great teeth
she took and made small by magic, and kept them in a bag of the great
wolf's fur. "Keep these," she said, giving the bag to Vegeta. "They
will come in useful someday."
<p>
"Hmmph. I don't see how, but one never knows.." Finally reverted to
his normal form, he reveled in the warmth of the white wolf's
fur. Only one thing marred the aftermath of his battle with Hati--his
left hand.  Once again, Vegeta tried to flex it, and could not. From
the wrist where the great winter wolf had bitten him, on down to the
fingertips, the hand was cold and lifeless--paralyzed. He could
neither move it nor channel power through it. "Not good," the prince
muttered.
<p>
"Rest," he told Kadru. "Next, Elivagar." The half-moon had not moved
in hours; it still stood high above the mountains, half-in and
half-out of the netherworld.
<p>

<p>
Chi-chi sighed; the pansies were wilting. Not enough rain this month,
and the craziness with Goku coming back and Vegeta's death and Bulma
and the kids staying over and then getting lost and Goku's long dead
brother Raditz coming back had played havoc with her gardening
schedule. The truth was, she'd completely forgotten to take care of
her plants with everything else that had been going on. She tended the
flowers while Goten played happily in the dirt pile from this year's
vegetable garden. Gohan was away at school, Daddy was taking a nap,
and Goku was out fishing--it was just her and Goten and her
garden. The half-moon had just risen, and was barely over the horizon.
<p>
Intent on her pansies, the normally alert Chi-chi didn't hear the car
coast to a stop part way down the drive, nor see the three men creep
up on the house.  A fourth, a sallow youth in fatigues and
mirror-shades, waited at the car, ready to crank it up and speed away.
<p>
"Who you?" Goten asked.  Chi-chi looked up, just in time to see a
burly man in a sleeveless shirt and dirty jeans grab her baby. Another
man in fatigues smoking a cigarette stood by, an automatic rifle
carelessly pointed in her direction.  The third man wore dark
sunglasses, a fine shirt and slacks, and spoke into a sat-phone.  A
pistol graced his other hand.
<p>
"HEY! PUT ME DOWN!" Goten yelled, and bit the burly man's arm.
<p>
The man cursed incoherently and smacked Goten in the face with his
other hand--big mistake!
<p>
Chi-chi screamed, and power seethed around her--the cigarette-smoker
almost dropped his rifle in surprise, and the fancy goon with the
sat-phone gawked at her, and started yelling into his phone.
<p>
Cigarette-smoker recovered his rifle just in time to see Chi-chi's
charge. Before he could raise his gun, her side-kick caught him in the
gut, and he doubled up, gasping--and dropped his rifle. Chi-chi's
second strike caught him under the chin--his eyes rolled up and he
collapsed in a heap. Out for the count.  Chi-chi whirled.
<p>
Burly man was trying desperately to hang on to a wriggling, angry,
biting Goten, and not doing too well. Blows didn't seem to bother the
angry child (unbeknownst to the thugs, Goten was used to getting hit
harder playing with his uncle), but after several bloody bites, the
burly guy managed to pin Goten under his arm, holding the kid's hands
together behind his back. Then Chi-chi kicked him between the legs,
and the burly man stopped doing much of anything except holding
himself and screaming.
<p>
Meanwhile, the fancy goon dropped the phone and started screaming
"Sekko-Ma! Sekko-Ma! HELP US!" at the top of his lungs.  Chi-chi
leaped toward him, and silenced him with two blows.
<p>
Chi-chi looked around, with a fierce scowl on her face. All three
goons were down, unconscious or helpless, and Goten got to his feet,
sputtering indignantly. Chi-chi ran over to him, and hugged him.
<p>
"Oh, Goten baby, it's okay, I stopped the bad men that tried to get
you. They won't be bothering you now," she comforted him.
<p>
"How come you don't burn 'em up like Nunk Rats does, Mama?" asked
Goten.
<p>
"Because these are human beings, Goten, and we don't kill people
unless there is NO other way to protect ourselves, honey." Remind me,
she thought grimly to herself, to SPEAK to Goku about his brother's
influence.  And I used to think those karate bums Kulilin, Muten
Roshi, and Yamcha were a bad influence!  At least they're not
mercenary killers like Raditz--or just plain killers like Vegeta! I
don't need Raditz giving Goten the notion that vaporizing people just
because they annoy you is a good idea!
<p>
The fancy goon stirred, lifting his bloody head a bit. A smile of
triumph flashed across his face. "Sekko-Ma!" He fainted.
<p>
Chi-chi whirled--and a hard, scaly fist slammed her across the
jaw. She started to fall, caught herself, and fell back into fighting
stance, blinking tears of pain from her eyes as something man-size and
dinosaur-like flashed in front of her. A long whip-like tail snapped
around and hooked her ankles, throwing her; then a four-toed, clawed
foot with one huge gutting claw, curled back, smashed down against her
head--and everything went black.
<p>
Goten screamed as his mother fell to the winged dinosaur-thing
standing over her. "DADDY! NUNK RATS! HELLLLPPPPP!" The dinosaur-thing
bounded over to him, and silenced him with a single kick to the head.
<p>
Scout crouched over the fallen bodies. "You can get up now," he hissed
at his fallen flunkies. "You're safe from the unarmed woman and the
little boy," he hissed sardonically. "They are ours!"
<p>
Behind Scout, the half-moon hung barely above the horizon.

<p>
Raditz skimmed low over the treetops, thoroughly delighted.  "Raditz
to base, everything's working like a charm!" He grinned, and rolled
over on his back just for the hell of it.
<p>
"Roger, you're coming in loud and clear. Are you flying upside down,
or is our telemetry feed screwed up?" Bulma's voice rang clear as a
bell in the scouter's earpiece.
<p>
Raditz laughed, and rolled again. "Just having some fun." He dove down
abruptly into the canyon that appeared before him, and swooped up the
opposite wall--and continued zooming straight up, climbing thousands
of feet in less than a minute. His aura flared around him, a sheet of
translucent white flame. "How's this?"
<p>
Bulma whistled over the scouter's commlink. "I've built jets slower
than you!"
<p>
Raditz slowed, climbing a bit on sheer momentum as he leveled
out. "Heh. I thought we were testing the armor, not me!"
<p>
"And the telemetry, and the scouter's commlink, and calibrating the
energy detection circuits," replied Bulma. "Speaking of which, we need
to.."
<p>
"..see if the overload cut-out works!" Raditz answered into his
scouter's voice pickup. "I know exactly how to do that, too!" He
twisted and dove, changing course suddenly.
<p>
"That's not what I meant!" Bulma's voice echoed anxiously in his
ear. "We've only got the one prototype so far, don't break it!"
<p>
"And if it breaks, you need to re-design it anyway!" Raditz yelled as
he hurtled through the air towards Son Goku's home in the forest.
<p>
(NUNK RATS! HELLLLPPPPP!)
<p>
What the hell? Raditz stopped abruptly in mid-air. I felt--Goten?
GOTEN!  He's in trouble! Raditz felt for Goten's presence.. and found
it, just barely. So weak--he's hurt! The big Saiyan rocketed downward,
aura blazing white around him.  Ahead of him, the half-moon hung
barely above the horizon.

High up the mountain, on the banks of a mountain stream, Goku
patiently stalked his prey.  The silver trout hovered in the rushing
water of the cold stream, oblivious to the patient fingers that
tickled its belly, lulling it, nudging it slowly to the surface.
<p>
(!!!)
<p>
Goku gasped and started; a feeling like a sudden blow to his head, yet
gone before he could truly feel it. The trout darted away in panic at
the sudden move.
<p>
"Chi-chi!" Goku jumped up, and whistled for Kintouen; something had
happened to Chi-chi! He leaped upon the magical golden cloud, and sped
down the mountain toward the house.
<p>

<p>
"Alright, already! I think you've got enough rope on her, she's not
going to wake up, untie herself and climb out of the trunk anytime
soon. Can we get a move on here?"  The goon in the expensive shirt
scowled at his companions, and glared at the sallow-faced driver.
<p>
The driver giggled, looking down at the helpless bound woman and
child. "The big guy is here," he gestured at Scout, who paced
restlessly at the end of the road, "so we're safe. Can't we just take
a few minutes to have some fun with the kid?" He giggled again,
reaching down as if to stroke the unconscious Goten.
<p>
The fancy goon slapped his hand away. "You'll get your
chance.. later!" He turned to Scout. "Sekko-Ma! We are done here!"
Scout nodded, and flapped away.
<p>
He turned from the demon to look at his companions. The man in
fatigues held his jaw, which had a rapidly swelling lump on it; the
burly man glared murderously at the unconscious Chi-chi and didn't
look like he was ready to take orders from anyone.
<p>
"I said LATER!" the well-dressed gangster snarled. "Get in the car,
now!" He slammed the trunk lid shut, and they all got in the car.
<p>
"Are you muttonheads forgetting the plan already? Can't you put off
your thrills fer a few lousy hours?  You'll get all the fun you
like--remember, we're going to be taping the whole thing, and you're
to make it last as long as possible." The fancy goon pulled out a gold
cigarette case, from which he extracted a cigarette, which he lit with
a gold lighter.
<p>
"Okay," growled the burly man. "I'm looking forward to paying that
bitch back!"
<p>
"The little boy is mine," giggled the sallow-faced driver. "I like
little boys; they scream almost as much as little girls!"
<p>
The other man didn't say anything; his jaw hurt too much, but he
nodded agreement with his companions.
<p>
"What about you, Sal?" the burly man asked the fancy goon.
<p>
"You know I like knife-work best," Sal smirked, "so I get my kicks
last. I'll just have to let you fellows enjoy yourselves first."
<p>
"You're such a nice guy, Sal," the burly guy grinned evilly. "It may
be a while--I can make a fiesty woman like that last a long time." He
laughed unpleasantly, and then began to describe in graphic detail
what he planned to do to Chi-chi.
<p>
The sallow-faced driver giggled, and contributed the details of his
own vile plans for the child.  Ahead of them, the half-moon hung
barely above the horizon.

Back at Capsule Corp, the technician monitoring Raditz's telemetry
looked up, startled. "Ms Bulma? I've just lost all three comm channels
from the monitor. He must have lost the commlink."
<p>
"No." Bulma listened intently on her headset. "He turned them off
deliberately; I'm still receiving on the private channel." She
straightened up abruptly, turning white as she listened.
<p>

<p>
BANG! CRUNCHHH! The car shuddered under impact, and skidded to a
halt, throwing its passengers about. The rear right door burst open
under the sudden jolt and the man with the sore jaw, who hadn't been
wearing a seat belt, went flying to land on his face in the road.
<p>
"WHAT THE HELL?" screamed Sal the Knife as he fought to free himself
from the locked-down seatbelt.  The driver was unconscious, his face
bleeding where'd he hit the steering wheel. (He hadn't been wearing a
seat belt, either). The burly man cursed and flung the left rear door
open.
<p>
SOMETHING had smashed into the left front fender, knocking the car off
the road, and had ripped the trunk lid clean off. The burly man barely
noticed that the trunk was empty before he saw their would-be victims
in the arms of the weirdest-looking guy he'd seen short of Sekko-Ma
and Keikan-Ma themselves. The thug gaped at the incredibly
long-haired, powerfully built man who was FLYING, gently setting the
woman and child down at the side of the road, well out of the way. The
stranger was clad in a black bodysuit and some kind of white body
armor, secured with a silly looking brown fur belt, and he looked
angry.
<p>
Sal the Knife finally got loose from his seatbelt and kicked the front
right door open and stormed angrily out. "Who the hell do you think
you are, asshole?" he challenged, waving his pistol for emphasis. The
burly man drew his.
<p>
"I'm the one who couldn't help overhearing your plans," Raditz said,
his lips drawn back in a grimace that only a fool would mistake for a
smile. Unfortunately for Sal, he was a fool.
<p>
"Right, sure, uh-huh. You don't know who you're messing with, do you?
SEKKO-MA!" Sal called. "Odeko, kill this idiot," he ordered the burly
man.
<p>
Odeko grinned and leveled his gun at Raditz, pulling the trigger in
one smooth move.  He pulled it three more times--and stopped grinning.
Raditz stood there, smirking, with his closed hand in front of him.
He opened it to reveal four mushroomed bullets.
<p>
"I should introduce myself," the big Saiyan said. "I'm Raditz, and the
little kid you had plans for is my nephew." He flicked his hand, and
tossed the bullets back at Odeko--at full velocity.  The burly man
went down, four holes blasted through his chest.
<p>
"SEKKO-MA, I really need you NOW!" screamed Sal the Knife as Raditz
raised his hand and pointed at him.
<p>
The flap of wings alerted Raditz as he was on the edge of killing Sal.
He ducked and spun, to find himself facing a mottled yellow-green
winged dinosaur-thing trying to kick him in the face with a very large
clawed toe. Raditz flung himself to one side, barely dodging in
time--one claw skittered off the white armor.  The monster was fast!
<p>
No scouter reading to warn him, nothing at all. "Damn thing doesn't
work," Raditz growled.  No, he couldn't sense the monster, either, he
thought, as he threw energy at it. It dodged to one side with its
incredible speed, and threw out its wings to brake itself, a frilled
collar on the sides of its head also flaring out. It spat a mouthful
of green goo at him; Raditz ducked. He heard a high-pitched scream
behind him.
<p>
"Raditsu!" it hissed, looking almost surprised. It flipped its hind
legs up, slashing at his face with the oversized, razor-sharp
thumbclaws. Raditz blocked it with difficulty--he was far the
stronger, but the demon was faster! His aura flamed as Raditz took to
the air, striking furiously at the fragile-looking creature. Any one
of his blows should have shattered the delicate wing bones, broken the
gracile skull--but none of them landed. The dinosaur-demon dodged
every one, and darted back, out of reach.  Behind him, the screaming
went on and on.
<p>
Raditz turned to look; the green goo had caught Sal square in the
face, and he was on the ground, convulsing hideously as his face
blistered and bled. "Watch out for demon-dinosaur spit," Raditz noted
to himself, as he started after the monster.
<p>

<p>
&lt;Great Deputy! It is he, the weakest adult! Raditsu is here, he takes
the prey from us!&gt; Scout cried to his master across their mindlink.
<p>
&lt;Raditz there? Get out of there! NOW!&gt; snarled Deputy.
<p>
&lt;But he is the weakest of the adults, and our prey will be lost!&gt;
<p>
&lt;You FOOL! You are supposed to have my wits! We can stalk our prey
again, but YOU are not so easy to replace! Flee while you can, he is
stronger than you think! I myself will deal with him when the time
comes.&gt;
<p>

<p>
The demon flipped itself around, and with a flap of its wings, darted
away, skimming low over the treetops.  Raditz sent a small barrage of
ki blasts winging after it, but it dodged all of them, disappearing
below the treetops. Something else was coming in fast in a flash of
gold--Kakarott! Riding that weird gold cloud thing of his...
<p>
Chin, the man in the fatigues with the broken jaw crouched beside
Sal's corpse and pryed the pistol from his dead hand. He carefully
lined up the sights on Chi-chi's unconscious form--yeah, he'd pay the
bitch back for hurting him. His finger started to tighten on the trigger..
<p>
Out of the corner of his eye, Raditz saw the fatigue-wearing man
pointing a weapon at Chi-chi who was lying helpless--
<p>
ZAAACCK! Raditz hit the goon with a single back-handed blast; he
burned.  "Kakarott!  Get that damn monster, I'll deal with the rest of
these goons! And watch out for its spit, it's poisonous!" Without
looking to see if his brother complied, Raditz dove back to the car.
<p>
Goku swooped to where the mottled green and brown monster had vanished
into the trees. He couldn't sense it, and he couldn't see it. It was
as if it had vanished into thin air--teleported away, perhaps. No
good; he turned back, dropping to land beside Chi-chi and Goten.
<p>
"Chi-chi!" Goku cradled his wife in his arms, anxiously checking her
over. Except for a bruise on her face and a lump on her head, she
seemed unharmed; likewise his youngest son. He started to remove the
ropes binding them. Chi-chi groaned and began to stir.
<p>
Crack! Goku looked up as the last goon died. "Raditz! There was no
need for that; he was no threat to you!"
<p>
Raditz looked coldly at Goku, his hand still on the driver's broken
neck. "Kakarott--you didn't hear the plans they had for your mate and
son; I did. Believe me, there was need."  His voice shook with rage.
<p>
"Goku?" Chi-chi said groggily, instantly diverting Goku's attention
from Raditz again. He hurriedly removed the rest of the ropes.
<p>
"Chi-chi? Are you all right? What happened?" Goku was frantic with
worry.
<p>
"Goku? Where's Goten? They tried to kidnap my baby!" Chi-chi struggled
out of Goku's arms, and gathered up Goten, looking him over. "He's
hurt; that monster must have kicked him in the head like he did me!"
She cradled Goten, worrying over him, until he started to wake up.
<p>
"They tried to kidnap BOTH of you," Raditz growled. He stood beside
the wrecked car, studying several items in his hands. Then he touched
a button on the side of his new scouter.

"Bulma! You still there? Good. Some goons and a monster tried to
kidnap Goten and Chi-chi; we interrupted them.  Yes, I cut off the
three monitored channels deliberately--some things are more convenient
if NOT recorded. Never mind that now. Can you and Mr. Hiregumi find
something out about the goons attached to these names?" Raditz read
off four names and addresses from the driver's licenses in his hand.
<p>
Goku stared at him. "Raditz, what are you doing?"
<p>
Raditz half-smiled at Goku, and tapped the scouter again, cutting the
commlink. "Mr. Hiregumi, Capsule Corp's chief of security, isn't much
of a warrior--though I suppose he's dangerous enough to scum like
this," Raditz nudged Odeko's corpse with a booted toe, "but I learned
things from him I never imagined possible about the investigative side
of security. Heh." Raditz glanced keenly at his brother. "I would very
much like to know why these bastards came after my nephew and your
mate, because.." he paused significantly, "they may try it again.  And
I'd REALLY like to know where that poison-acid spitting dinosaur from
hell came from!"
<p>
Chi-chi shuddered. "He was too fast and too strong for me. The men
came first, they tried to kidnap Goten, but I stopped them--"
<p>
"So you're the one who broke that other idiot's jaw! Explains why he
tried to finish you. Good job." Raditz interrupted, pointing offhand
at the smoking corpse in fatigues.
<p>
Chi-chi glared angrily at Raditz, and then smiled grimly as she
realized: he's impressed! He didn't know I could fight! Hmmm.. "I
stopped them," she continued. "But the last one called that
dinosaur-demon; 'Sekko-Ma', he named it. I didn't sense it coming--I
turned around and there it was, hitting me. It was so fast! I guess it
must have knocked out Goten, too." She leaned against her husband,
taking comfort in his strong arms. "If it weren't for you, Goku..."
<p>
Goku hugged Chi-chi, but looked slightly embarassed. "Ah, Chi-chi, I
got here late, didn't do more than see tail of demon flying
away. Raditz did well."  He looked at his brother. "Raditz, thank you
for saving Chi-chi and Goten." Goku looked puzzled. "How'd you get
here so fast? And where did you get the armor and scouter?"
<p>
"They're Bulma's new prototypes. I like 'em already, though we still
need to calibrate the scouter. I'm here because, well, I sort of
'heard' Goten yelling for help, calling me." He shrugged.
<p>
"Ah. You're telepathic like me and Vegeta, aren't you?" Goku looked
mysteriously pleased.
<p>
"I.. don't know, exactly. I used to be, a little bit--I felt it when
father died, when all Vegetasai died. I never was close enough to
anyone, friend or enemy, after that, to develop that kind of bond."
Raditz shrugged again.
<p>
His brother seemed delighted for no reason that Raditz could
fathom. "You are now."

In downtown Satan City, Sean Nixon was not so delighted; in fact, he
was drunk and demoralized.
<p>
"Snakebite." He managed to look coherent enough for the bartender at
the club to brew him another of the potent drinks. Yeah, next morning
he'd have a hell of a headache, and everything would still be gone,
but for now, Sean didn't care.
<p>
All the work he'd done over the last few weeks--gone. He'd still been
online, in his VirtualBlack guise, when the computer panicked and
crashed on him. It had taken him hours to get it up and running
again--he'd had to re-install the entire system--and that's when he
found out he'd been wiped.  Everything not backed up had been trashed,
erased, obliterated beyond recovery. Even worse, his net archives had
been methodically located and erased as well.
<p>
Worst of all, the "Dreams" folder--his paintings-- had been
destroyed. Those he had no backups of; he'd wanted to be able to
destroy them completely and quickly if necessary.  But it hadn't been
necessary! They were Sean's art, his unique creations, his
children.. Sean slammed down the Snakebite.  He suddenly didn't want
to be here anymore. He just wanted to go home and be miserable alone.
<p>
It was no better at home. Sean sat, brooding, on his couch in the dark
apartment, until he fell asleep. While he slept, he dreamed--nightmare
vistas of hellish domains, populated by a grim warrior race with
monkey-like tails. Other things, too, intruded on his dreams--leering
goat demons and fierce bull-headed monsters, corpse-devouring dragons
and serpents of darkness.
<p>
He awoke with a start. It was full dark, except for a dim light
through the window. Sean's head throbbed, and his mouth felt like he'd
eaten tar sand all night. He sat up, and moaned in pain.
<p>
"I can't believe I got that drunk--why do I do this to myself?  Every
damn time I wake up with a hangover, I remember why I don't like to
get plastered like that.. and after a few months, I forget how much it
hurts, and do it again.  Sean, you are a dumbass!" he scolded himself.
<p>
"Why is it so bright in here?" he complained to no one in particular,
as he got up and looked out the window. The moon hung just above
the horizon, a few degrees past full. Sean scratched his head;
something didn't seem quite right about that. Oh well, astronomy had
never been one of his good subjects.
<p>
Art now.. art had always been his best subject. He loved to paint, to
create scenes never seen before--even with the risks. Only.. all his
paintings and images were gone! Everything he had done--burned or
erased.  Sean's head hurt, and a dull anger at the hand fate dealt him
seethed inside.  Something in Sean rebelled; he would paint, and to
Hell with the consequences!
<p>
He rummaged around the back of his closets until he found it; one
blank canvas left over from years ago, and his box of paints and
brushes. For some reason he'd never thrown them out, and Sean thanked
the teacher who'd always made him put his supplies away properly, no
matter how soon or how long before he planned to use them again.  All
the brushes were still in good shape, and many of the tubes of paint
were salvageable.
<p>
Sean set up the canvas on his easel, and started sketching out the
scene that burned in his mind's eye. Burned was a good word, he
thought ironically, for the throneroom of a king in Hell. The king,
Sean decided, was the father of the demon prince from his previous two
drawings--now vanished with the rest of his computer files.  He would
be taller than the diminutive prince, and bearded, with chestnut brown
hair, Sean thought as he sketched out the scene.  His white-cloaked
guards with the fur tails wrapped around their waists lined the
throneroom on either side, and before him another white-cloaked
warrior knelt and bowed his head...

<p>
In Hell, Commander Kale knelt before King Vegeta and made his
report. "Forgive me, sire, but the news is not the best. The remaining
broo and other lesser demons have gone to ground in the Pit of Worms,
and it is taking much time to root them out one beast at a time." The
Saiyan warrior glanced up, trying to gauge how well his king was
taking the news. King Vegeta continued frowning, and gestured at him
to continue.
<p>
"Some of the men have reported odd.. disturbances, sire. I don't know
entirely what to make of it, sire, but I believe that someone may be
trying to summon the broo.. to Earth."
<p>
King Vegeta sighed wearily. "Is it my curse for killing you, Kale,
that you are always the bearer of evil news? First the death of the
Prince at Frieza's hands, then the arrival of that Cell creature, the
great demon's attack on the rift, my son's second death by that
demon.. and this."
<p>
"Not by my intention, sire, but.. if my death was indeed necessary to
appease Frieza over the Planet Tsaba matter long enough for you to
gather the forces to strike at him--as you did--it would have been
good to have had the chance to volunteer, sire."  Commander Kale
bowed his head.
<p>
Kale's reproach stung like the lash of a scorpion-tailed whip.
"Frieza had to be appeased because you were overly optimistic in the
first place!" King Vegeta snarled. The damned king then sighed; he
knew the bitter truth. "And in the end, it mattered not--three hours,
three days, three years would not have been enough... not against
Freiza.. and Frieza had already decided our doom."  King Vegeta bowed
his head. "Forgive me for wasting your life, Kale. You were--you
ARE--a good and loyal commander, and deserved better."  It was the
hardest thing he'd ever said, in life or death.
<p>
Commander Kale looked up at his monarch, surprised, for a long
moment. "It is forgiven, sire. As you say, sire.. in the end, it
mattered not at all. We were all brought to the same doom; I merely
got here a day sooner."

On Earth, Sinhika received ill news of her own.  "I don't believe
this! Every one of my credit cards just happens to be cancelled at
once? No." She skimmed the rest of her e-mail. "A-ha! Here's one from
Khara; I'll bet he has something to do with this!"
<PRE>
    ...it is father's desire that you return home, dear
    sister. Again, I add my concern to his and implore you to
    return.  It is only concern for your safety that impels me to
    these actions; I cannot sit idly by and let you use the
    treasury to finance your own destruction. Accordingly, I have
    suspended your access to all instruments of the Lankha
    treasury, with one exception: you will be permitted to arrange
    airline flights back to Serendip. I hope that good sense will
    prevail and you will return immediately, but if not, I'm sure
    that pragmatism will win out in the end--I know you well
    enough, Sinhika, to know that poverty and hunger do not suit
    you at all.

		    Your elder brother,
		    Khara, Prince of Lankha
</PRE>
<p>
"YOU BASTARD!" Sinhika screamed at the offending e-mail. "I can't
believe Father had you do this!" She re-read the letter. "No--if
Father required me to return home, all he had to do was command
it, as his royal perogative, and I would return. He knows
that. This is Khara's doing, and ONLY Khara's doing! Father
probably wishes I would return home, worries about me, and would
be pleased if I came home, but he's not insisting on it. No, my
oh-so-helpful big brother took it on himself to get me to come
home."
<p>
Sinhika paced the apartment and growled. "You're not going to have
your way, Khara! I will NOT come crawling back home just because
you think you know what is best for me! There is too much
happening here--too much that touches on our duty, and my
destiny."
<p>
The orange-haired rakshasa thought a bit. "Two things: either get
my credit cards and accounts reinstated somehow, or.. get a job."
Sinhika sat down at the computer. "Didn't Pomona say that cute
boyfriend of hers was something of a hacker? I'll go talk to Sean,
then." She typed rapidly. "Meanwhile, let's start looking for
possible employment, just in case..."

<p>
In Niflheim, the snow howled past Vegeta's face, and he reveled in
it. Yes! I have defeated my deadliest enemy here, that infernal cold!
And whatever benefit Kadru got from that bit of peach seems to have
stopped her continual whining.
<p>
Prince Vegeta rose higher, Kadru in his arms, flying above the frozen
black river of ice that cracked and heaved as sheer ice pressure
forced it to move slowly downstream. Great slabs of ice buckled and
overrode each other as the relentless flow pushed the ice along the
bed of the Gioll, grinding everything in its path like a glacier, yet
moving almost as fast as a river during spring breakup.
<p>
"WHAT THE??"
<p>
Vegeta slammed to a halt in mid-air, his aura flaring around
him. Ahead, Nifleheim.. ended. The Prince of the Saiyajin looked down
into Elivagar. Mountains bowed down, crumbled into a roaring cauldron
of blackness that vomited out slabs of tainted ice, ice that crashed
and thundered down the bed of the river, or shattered against the
mountains into crystals of black slush. Like a volcano of ice, it
flung bombs of ice high into the air--Vegeta dodged one that came his
way--and spewed clouds of ice crystals and snow high, high into the
air, fuelling the perpetual blizzard that raged across Niflheim.
<p>
Great as Elivagar was, an even greater marvel shadowed it. Plunging
into poisoned Elivagar was one tremendous root, a root that ran up a
mountain and into the sky, to join something Vegeta could barely make
out in the ice fog and snow--something that looked like a tree. But
what a tree! The very mountains were bumps under its roots, and it
rose beyond imagining.
<p>
"Yggdrasil.." Vegeta shielded his eyes against the snow, craning his
head to look at the fabled World Tree.
<p>
"How do you know all these things? Are you a scholar as well as a
warrior?" Princess Kadru queried.
<p>
"I? I am a warrior, the greatest of warriors, and the prince of a
warrior race. Prince Khara of Lankha, on the other hand, is not much
of a warrior--no more than mediocre--but he is a brilliant scholar! He
also has the rare ability to summarize intelligently, missing none of
the important points, yet adding nothing unnecessarily. When I get
around to conquering the galaxy, I'll want someone like him on my
General Staff. Maybe I'll offer Khara himself the job."  Vegeta
chuckled, feeling pleased with himself.
<p>
He looked down at Elivagar again, suddenly less pleased. Yes! Vegeta
scowled; he could feel it, ever so faintly--that foulness, that
unnatural taint that marked the demon and its kin. Was this the taste
of Chaos? Just where did the well of Elivagar spring from? In all the
legends Khara had found, it welled up from nowhere, from outside the
very universe.
<p>
Vegeta dropped Kadru on a horizontal stretch of Yggdrasil's root, and
hovered over the heart of the maelstrom.  Now and again he dodged a
splinter of ice the size of a building, thrown up by Elivagar's
violence. Something down there in the heart of darkness beckoned to
him, called him with a song of blood and violence and terror.
<p>
Kadru found no such attraction in this place of primal ice and
evil. She clung desperately to the ice-slick root of the World Tree,
and peered down, trying to watch Vegeta through the ice fog and
snow. The snake-princess observed several ragged holes and tears in
the side of the root below her, holes that looked as if something had
been chewing splintered chunks out of the root. "I don't like this,"
she muttered to herself. "Prince Vegeta! Where are you going?"
<p>
Unhearing, Vegeta looked down into the maelstrom, descending
slowly--unbeknownst to him.  Something moved down there, something
besides the heaving black ice.  A dim phosphorensce moved, rising
sinously toward him. Without thinking, he descended further, trying to
get a better view of the thing.
<p>
His eyes went wide as a great white worm-thing surged into
view. Nearly as big as the Eternal Dragon Shen Long, and far more
loathsome, Nidhogg the Corpse-Tearer rose from Elivagar. It was the
pallid white of a stiffening corpse, its soft and bloated skin
suggesting decay. Frills of writhing tendrils like so many maggots
edged its spine and made an obscene mane over its neck and head. Blunt
chisel teeth filled its gaping maw, and huge dull grey eyes like those
of a dead fish looked up at the dead prince.
<p>
Nidhogg sang. Its song was a thrumming vibration that shattered the
ice into black slush, a wordless song of blood and violence and terror
that called to Vegeta, lured him ever downward. I know you, you are
mine, it called. Something in the back of Vegeta's mind tried to warn
him that this was wrong, he was coming too close--too late! Vegeta
looked into the dead grey eyes of the Corpse-Tearer, and was caught.
<p>
Prince Vegeta did not see that cloudy orb as large as himself; instead
he saw Nappa die again by his hand, felt his own rage and seething
power turned against his lifelong mentor--and felt, too, what Nappa
had felt--shock, a terrible hurt and betrayal as the hand he thought
extended to help him turned into the instrument of his death, the
swift agony of death at the hand of his revered Prince-- and then came
every other person he'd ever killed in cold blood. He lived again
every murder he'd ever committed, feeling both his own hate and their
agony.
<p>
He was vaguely aware that he'd lost control of himself, and was no
longer flying.  Vegeta fell heavily into the icy slush covering
Elivagar's inner slope, and started to slide downward, helpless in the
grip of Nidhogg's gaze. Instinctively he clawed at the ice, trying to
stop himself, but there was very little strength in the small part of
his soul not trapped by the Corpse-Tearer, and the one hand was still
useless. Still, he slowed himself--and then came Arlia.
<p>
Vegeta lost himself completely for a time, as his self-hate-driven
murder of the world he'd rescued from its tyrant king exploded again
in his memories.  When that was past, he became vaguely aware that his
downward slide had stopped--in Nidhogg's jaws.  It had him up to the
waist; his hands were pressed against the chisel teeth crushing his
ribs, feebly trying to stop the monster from devouring him
completely.
<p>
You fool! that unthralled bit of the back of his mind raged at
him. Nidhogg the Corpse-Tearer is this hell's Cleanser of Souls--the
one who devours wicked souls and strips them of their evil, their
memories, and their power! When he's done with me, all that will be
left of me will be a mindless wisp of spirit, if anything! No more
Prince of the Saiyajin, no more Vegeta, no more ME!
<p>
Now he understood the bitter significance of Indrajit's parting words:
"You have ever been your own worst enemy--beware, lest darkness within
betray you to darkness without!" NO! This cannot be! If I end
here--NO! Kakarott! Trunks! Bulma! I WILL NOT FAIL YOU!
<p>
"BULMA!" he screamed as the chisel teeth slammed down, shattering his
ribs.

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Dark">XII. DARK HEART</A></H1>
<p>
"BULMA!" Bulma started awake, blurry and confused for a moment.
<p>
"Vegeta?" Where was he? She'd heard him call her name in desperate
anguish--no, wait. Bulma's head cleared, as she remembered where she
was and when. She was at home, and Vegeta--was dead. Had been dead for
months. The familiar ache in her soul gnawed at her, and the tears ran
down her face.
<p>
"But I heard him." Bulma got up and drew on a nightgown. "Where are
you, Vegeta? And when will you come back to me?" There was no answer,
nor did she really expect any. Last week's dream.. perhaps it was just
a dream. Perhaps not.. the scent of him had lingered in the air.
<p>
A pale half-moon hung just above the horizon, highlighting the lonely
bedroom in moonlight and shadows. Bulma watched the moon,
puzzled. "Something is very, very wrong." She went to her bookshelf
and started digging around. "Ah ha, Daily Almanac. Moon phases. Oh,
my." She looked at the moon again, and looked at the almanac again,
and reached for the telephone.
<p>
"..uh huh... assumed a geosynchronous orbit.. hmmm..."
<p>
After a long conversation, she hung up. "Well. So the 'learned
astronomers' have no idea, and are trying to figure out how to make it
public before everyone panics." She stared hard at the moon. "What
could possibly have stopped the moon in its orbit? And why?"
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
In Niflheim, Vegeta shuddered in agony as Nidhogg's venom seeped into
his wounded spirit. He had no strength left; the poison stole what
little had remained untrapped by the Corpse-Tearer's gaze.  Only a
terrible regret was left--regret that he would not see or even
remember Bulma, or Trunks, or Kakarott, or Gohan or any of them, ever
again; regret that he had failed them and failed himself; regret that
all memory and knowledge of everything he'd been and seen and done
would soon be gone forever; and bitterest of all, the knife-sharp
regret for the things he had done half-mad with hate and rage for so
many bitter years--the deeds were not worth the cost.
<p>
What was the temporary quenching of anger in someone's blood, the
lashing out in a moment's hate to kill, worth? What satisfaction did
they give in the end? None that lasted. Worthless, compared to holding
Her in his arms; nothing, compared to a wonderful, precious
violet-haired son, his flesh and blood and power; and empty, compared
to the rivalry (or was it something more?) with his
comrade/enemy/rival/ally Kakarott.
<p>
The agony receded, and a strange lassitude replaced it. Vegeta's eyes
closed, he struggled no more. Crushed and broken in the jaws of the
Corpse-Tearer, he awaited oblivion.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Oblivion did not take him.  Nidhogg suddenly spasmed and heaved his
head high into the air; fresh agony tore through Vegeta as Nidhogg
spat him out. The Corpse-Tearer's thrumming song changed to a high
wail of agony. The Saiyan prince tumbled through the air; below him,
Nidhogg thrashed like a headless snake, clawing madly at one darkened
eye.  Still too weak to move, let alone fly, Vegeta could only stare
in wonder; above the Corpse-Tearer, tail coiled tightly around a
splinter of Yggdrasil's root, a monstrous cobra flared its hood and
spat venom into the death worm's eye.
<p>
Elivagar whirled beneath the prince; a monstrous slab of ice, tumbling
end over end as it flew into the air caught him and carried him with
it. By what miracle the ice slab shattered on Yggdrasil's root with
him atop the slab rather than crushed beneath, Vegeta never knew. He
sprawled lifeless on the root of the World Tree, weaker than a newborn
kitten--but still himself. He was still Prince Vegeta of the Saiyajin.
<p>
The moon-wolf's fur warmed him, and the horrid lassitude left his
soul. Vegeta's mind started working again. "How in all the hells did a
giant spitting cobra appear in the middle of Elivagar to attack--of
course! I am an idiot!  Kadru!  So that's what she looks like in her
snake form!"
<p>
With some effort Vegeta managed to move his right hand; he had that
much strength back.  With a great deal more painful effort, he rolled
himself over and crawled to where he could peer over the vast root
into Elivagar.  Now that Nidhogg's spell was broken, the Saiyan prince
felt stronger with every instant that passed; yet more strength seemed
to flow into him from the World Tree.
<p>
"What is that stupid snake doing now? Ah!" Vegeta smirked, watching as
a blinded Nidhogg sank into the depths, fleeing its small, vicious
tormentor.  Apparently satisfied, Kadru the Cobra tried to reverse
herself and crawl back up the splinter of root she clung to, but
slipped back repeatedly, foiled by the slick ice glazing the root. She
perservered; as Vegeta watched, she slowly, doggedly crawled up the
root in spiral coils, one laborious foot after another.
<p>
Vegeta chuckled, painfully. "She's persistant, I'll give her that." He
rolled over on his back, a slightly less painful position, and began
the agonizing task of putting his ribs back in place. Spectral bones
knitted as the strength returned to his soul, but it was no less
painful for that. "Raditz knew what he was talking about," Vegeta
muttered to himself. "It feels like I've been beaten to death by
Frieza all over again. Ayyyy-yaahhh!"
<p>
"What?" That sense of foulness, again--welling up, rising,
intensifying. At the same time, Elivagar's roar seem to change, become
deeper, more threatening. Vegeta hauled himself stiffly to his feet,
and looked down.
<p>
The cauldron of Elivagar was dark as night, and clouds of black ice
crystals swirled around it like the eye-wall of a hurricane. Kadru
still struggled up the lower root, and the darkness below began to
rise.
<p>
"<i>Kuso</i>!" Vegeta blazed with power, and plunged into the cauldron. The
foulness intensified into a burning ache--he felt again the monstrous
stinger plunged into his back, and the poison that burned through his
nerves--the taste of his own blood filled his mouth. He flung both
arms around the Kadru-cobra's body, and rocketed up, out of
Elivagar.
<p>
Energy crackled around him, and his hair blazed golden as he hurtled
the length of the Gioll carrying Kadru the Naga. Behind him, the
raging fury of Elivagar exploded in darkness. The hellish concussion
nearly swatted Vegeta from the sky; a shard of wood larger than a
skyscraper tumbled past him to impale a nearby mountain. He glanced
back once.
<p>
Darkness filled the sky, lit along the length of the World Tree by
weird green flashes.  Luminous green sap dripped from the cracked and
twisted root of Yggdrasil; the mountains surrounding Elivagar were
cracked and shattered, tops blown away. Something screamed in anger
and rage, and a great howl answered from ahead--Garm! Hel's
hound bayed his warning to all Niflheim. Vegeta caught a momentary
glimpse of something huge and winged, tailed and toothed and all vile,
rearing up where Elivagar's cauldron had raged. He did not need
another glance--the ache in his chest, the foul taste in his mouth
told Vegeta--THIS was his enemy!
<p>
"Time!" Vegeta realized. "Somehow I got to Niflheim BEFORE the demon
did!  He's only now tearing his way through to the next hell! I don't
believe this--it's insane! I don't dare fight him here before I fought
him on Earth; who knows what future THAT would create!"
<p>
Behind him, Cacodemon, Chaos demon of Death and Disorder, rose howling
from Elivagar, another layer closer to the World, and his ordained
prey. Vegeta did not look back again.

"SEAN! I know you're in there, open up this door before I kick it in!"
Sinhika was not in the mood for patience. She'd knocked repeatedly on
the door for a good ten minutes, and she knew Sean was home--she could
sense his presence.
<p>
Before she could bang on the door again, Sean flung it open from
inside, and stood there glowering at her. His black hair was tousled
and matted, he was unshaven, shirtless and barefoot. He blinked,
obviously just awake.
<p>
"What?" he scowled.
<p>
"Yeah, I'm happy to see you, too." Sinhika pushed her way inside, and
hooked the door shut with her foot. "I need the services of
VirtualBlack."
<p>
Sean gave her the finger, then reconsidered. "What for, you want to
get even with some ex-boyfriend?  I don't do that kind of crap. Just
security work--or are you paying?" He ran his fingers through his air,
trying to straighten out the mess.
<p>
"Paying is the problem. One of my dear family members got my credit
cards and bank accounts cancelled. ALL of them. I need at least one of
them reinstated." Sinhika laid her cards on the table. "Or, I need to
get a decent job in time to pay next month's rent." She smiled wryly.
<p>
At least I won't go hungry, she thought. Two more attempts to knock
over temples and kidnap priests in the last two days--who the heck are
these people? I can't let Khara run me out of town now--something is
going on that I need to get to the bottom of.
<p>
Sean frowned abruptly. "I guess you'll have to get a paying job. I
don't do banks; that kind of hacking gets you hard time.  They call it
bank fraud, and where I come from, it's 10-20 years of making little
rocks out of big ones."  He looked curiously at her. "You're an adult;
how could 'a family member' get YOUR accounts cancelled?"
<p>
Sinhika paced about the small living room. "They weren't exactly MY
accounts; more like expense accounts on the family treasury. I should
have just drawn enough off and set up my own independent accounts, but
I was lazy, and didn't think Khara--my brother--would pull a stunt
like this. <i>Achintya</i>!"
<p>
She looked Sean over. "You're cute without your shirt, but you look
like you've been pulled through a knothole. Howsa'bout I make you
dinner?"
<p>
"Uhhhh..." Sean's jaw dropped. He gulped as he came to his senses. The
incredibly gorgeous and graceful Sinhika was in HIS apartment, telling
him he looked good shirtless, and he, Sean, had been acting like a
complete boor. Where the hell was his brain?  On the floor with his
shirt, apparently.  "..sure!" He twisted his face into a smile. "I'll
go get cleaned up, there's some beer in the fridge, help yourself," he
babbled as he headed for the shower.
<p>
While he was gone, Sinhika prowled around the apartment and inspected
the kitchen. "Hmm.. hasn't cleaned the stove since he moved in, and
washes dishes once a month whether they need it or not. Typical
bachelor. Hmm.. hmmm.. need to pick up a few things."
<p>
A bit later, Sean emerged from the shower; Sinhika was nowhere in
sight. "I knew it was too good to be true," he muttered, and then
spotted the note on the table.
<p>
"GONE TO GET PIZZA STUFF -- Sinhika"
<p>
"Pizza? Where the hell is she getting pizza? There's no decent pizza
to be had this side of the Pacific Ocean!" Sean frowned.
<p>
A few minutes later, Sinhika came in the door with a bag of groceries.
<p>
Sean looked at her, puzzled. "I thought you were getting pizza."
<p>
"No, I was getting the stuff for MAKING pizza. Here, put these cokes
in the fridge--got to have caffeine to cut the grease."
<p>
"Home-made pizza?" Sean was astonished. "Do you know how long it's
been since I've had decent pizza? You are making me so homesick!"
<p>
Sinhika smiled at him. "Think of it as a bribe," she suggested
sweetly.
<p>
Sean stopped abruptly and shook his head. "Uh-uh. It ain't worth hard
time."
<p>
"Okay, help me find a job. Database searches, corporate job postings,
that sort of thing. And tell me about that painting you're working
on," she added casually as she started mixing the pizza dough.
<p>
"Uh, er, it's a painting," he said defensively.
<p>
"Well, duh. Even the beautiful but bubble-brained Sinhika can figure
that out," she said, winking at him. "I just wondered if you like,
used models from around here, or something."
<p>
"No, I don't use models at all. Why do you ask?" Sean asked slowly.
<p>
Sinhika shrugged. "Your king reminds me of someone I've met--couldn't
quite place my finger on who, though." As she was putting the pizza in
the oven, Sinhika said, "Pomona told me you didn't paint
anymore. What's the story here?"
<p>
Sean's face became expressionless. "Just.. artistic block, I guess. It
happens," Sean lied.
<p>
Boy, you are a lousy liar! Sinhika thought. That painting of yours
just reeks of magic, and your tall, sinister, handsome brown-haired
king looks like he could be a close relative of Ghost Prince
Vegeta. Not to mention the device on his armor, which matches that on
the armor of the Ghost Prince himself.
<p>
"Whatever," she said cheerily.
<p>
Later, much later, she asked Sean again. "What is the story with your
paintings?" She snuggled against him on the couch. Amazing how his
shyness and inhibitions had dropped away after six or seven
drinks.. amazing how well she had hidden the beer behind the
illusionary color and taste of coke.
<p>
Sean sighed. "I never did tell Pomona the real reason I dropped out of
art school and burned all my paintings--I just let her think it was
depression." He looked at her, worried. "You won't laugh, will you?
Even if you don't believe it?"
<p>
Sinhika shook her head solemnly. "Of course not!"
<p>
Sean leaned his head on his elbow. "It started with vivid dreams, in
art school. I needed inspiration, so I used my dreams--I painted them.
I was getting fairly good, though I didn't know it--I liked to paint
in a realistic style, and my modernist professors didn't approve of
realism--they wanted abstracts and 'interpretive' art, so I never got
good grades from them." He took another drink. "Anyway, my paintings
would.. change. I'd paint them, and go away, and the next day, things
would have changed.  At first it was just background details, things
only I would notice because I painted them, but then whole foreground
subjects would disappear! Or new ones appear--I wasn't sure what was
worse."
<p>
"'Foreground subjects'?" Sinhika raised an eyebrow.
<p>
"A nice neutral way of saying monsters.. demons. That was the kind of
thing I dreamed about and painted." Sean laughed ironically. He
frowned. "When it was only background details I dismissed it as just
harmless weirdness..." He gulped another drink. "But when the demons
started disappearing from the pictures, and I started hearing voices
in the night, and seeing things out of the corner of my eye..  I
started getting scared. I thought I was going crazy." Sean fell
silent.
<p>
"What then?" Sinhika prompted.
<p>
Sean shook his head. "Then my roommate started to see and
hear.. things. The last straw was when me, my roommate, his girl, my
girl were all together, and we saw THE THING FROM MY PAINTING. Right
in the middle of the hall, plain as you are standing there."  Sean
finished his drink. "It was the dripping wet footprints that convinced
me.  After that, I burned the paintings."
<p>
"What you're saying is.." Sinhika ventured cautiously.
<p>
"--that my paintings have a nasty habit of coming to life!" He yawned,
and laid his head in Sinhika's lap. "I told Pomona I didn't paint
anymore, but I never really stopped. I just did them on computer for
the last few years--they never seemed to get out of hand that
way. Only my computer was trashed, and I was mad, so I started
painting for real again." Sean murmured sleepily. "The demons are
different now--they look almost like people. Maybe they aren't the
same.. kind.. of.. monsters..." His eyes closed; Sean slept.
<p>
Sinhika gently stroked his black hair.  "Oh, Sean, I played a dirty
trick on you, getting you drunk so I could find out about your magic
painting." She kissed him lightly. "I'll make it up to you one of
these days--you're too cute and too sweet for me to be so mean to
you."  She extracted herself carefully without waking Sean, putting
a spare pillow under his head instead.
<p>
She stepped into the tiny second bedroom Sean used as a combination
computer room and studio, and studied the painting. The king who
reminded her of the Ghost Prince, his white-cloaked guards, the other
scar-faced warrior in the red cape standing beside the king, the
bull-headed demons--her eyes narrowed. She recognized the latter from
last night's temple; she'd taken the form of one of the bull-headed
temple guardians.
<p>
"Gozu Oni... these aren't just 'demons' as Sean thinks, these are
protectors of the divine order! They don't get involved unless the
gods are involved---or those appointed by the gods, like the rulers of
Hell.  What is the purpose of this picture?  From Sean's account, this
must be some kind of summoning magic, or a rift. But why this bunch?
And what is that infernal king's connection to the Ghost Prince?"
<p>
At that moment, the building shook, and the easel swayed ever so
slightly.  Sinhika's hand brushed the painting, and she snatched it
back guiltly.  She looked it over; no paint. "Guess it was dry
already. That was a good thing; it would be a shame to ruin Sean's
masterpiece because of a little earth tremor."  She dismissed the
minor earthquake without further thought; they were a daily occurence
here, on the edge of the Pacific plate.
<p>
"Time to go; I don't think Sean needs to worry about that lot climbing
out of his painting and eating his neighbors. If they're what I think
they are, they can't even go to the next room without filing a report
in triplicate first, let alone do something like come to Satan City
and cause trouble!"  Sinhika let herself out the door.
<p>
Behind her, the painting shimmered, responding to the touch of the
demon girl...

<p>
"Where's Kakarott?" Raditz asked abruptly as Chi-chi opened the
kitchen door.
<p>
Raditz and Trunks had just arrived for Trunks' training--since the
attempt on Chi-chi and Goten, Goku was staying close to home, where he
could keep an eye on them, and training Trunks and Gohan
there. Chi-chi rather liked it that way--Goku and her sons would be
home for dinner on time, for once, and Raditz and Trunks would happily
eat anything she put in front of them. However...
<p>
Chi-chi glared at Raditz, arms crossed. She'd had about enough of both
Raditz and Vegeta's bad manners--Vegeta she couldn't do anything about
(and besides, he was dead), but Raditz was another story. If he
thought Chi-chi was going to let him hang around and teach his
rudeness and bad attitude to little Goten, Raditz had another think
coming.
<p>
"I don't believe I know anyone by that name," Chi-chi answered.
<p>
"What?? Woman, don't play games with me! Where's Kakarott? I'd find
him myself, but he's got his ki down low," Raditz growled, looking
impatient. Behind him, Trunks watched, wide-eyed.
<p>
Chi-chi's voice was frosty. "My name is not 'woman', it's Chi-chi--or
more properly in your case, Mrs. Son."
<p>
"What?" Raditz looked confused and irritated. "What is this
foolishness?  You're my brother's mate, not a stranger!"
<p>
"First, I'm Goku's WIFE, not his 'mate', and second, if I had a
brother-in-law, I would think that he would know my name and his own
brother's name!" Chi-chi's voice dropped well below freezing. As
Chi-chi continued to glare, Trunks smiled, and put his hand over his
mouth to stop himself from giggling out loud.
<p>
Raditz blinked, completely bewildered. He scowled, started to say
something, and stopped abruptly--a sudden hunch that he was walking on
VERY dangerous ground. He gritted his teeth. "Chi-chi! Just tell me
where Kak--my brother is! Please. I promised him I'd bring Trunks over
today."
<p>
Chi-chi frowned only slightly. "GOKU said he'd be up around the first
waterfall on White Cloud Stream, and to meet him there. It's--"
<p>
"I know where it is," Raditz said impatiently. "That's where he took
the kids fishing. Trunks," he nodded to the purple-haired lad. "let's
fly; you do need the practice." He started to leave, when Chi-chi
interrupted him.
<p>
"Oh, one more thing. You can tell GOKU that if he's late for dinner,
he gets cold rice and yesterday's soup. You, too."
<p>
Raditz looked slightly worried; behind him, Trunks looked very
worried. "I'll.. tell him. We won't run late, I'll make sure of that!"
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Hours later in the afternoon, after training and some impromptu
sparring between Raditz and Goku, and a fine dinner that everyone had
showed up for on time (much to Trunks' relief--he'd been terrified of
getting nothing but leftover soup), Raditz and Goku found themselves
alone on Chi-chi's new back deck. (One of the things keeping Goku busy
was catching up on the last two years of projects and maintenance...)
<p>
Goku watched his brother. Raditz looked toward the horizon, at the
mountains and hills and forest; he seemed to be about to say something
several times, and then stopped.  Finally he looked at Goku.
<p>
"Kakarrot.. why are these things so hard for me, and so easy for you?
You seem to know what is right as if by instinct, and just do
it--while I had to struggle just to understand why what I did was
wrong! Damn it, Kakarott, I think the only good and useful thing I did
in my life the first time around was die!" Raditz leaned hard on the
new railing of twisted wrought iron, hands gripping it tightly, arms
tense.
<p>
"Raditz.." Goku looked at his brother, his face unusually serious and
thoughtful. "How did you miss learning that murder is wrong?"
<p>
"How did I miss that basic lesson?" Raditz laughed bitterly. "You
should know enough about us Saiyajin to know that by now!  I was
taught.. I believed that killing your enemies in battle was right, and
that all non-Saiyajin were enemies--if they were even people." He
shrugged. "Weaklings were always despised, and weaklings who were
different from us--aliens--well.. animals, vermin of some kind is all
they were."
<p>
"And even if I had believed differently.. like Diive.." Raditz
sighed. "You wouldn't know about Nappa's eldest son, Diive. Vegeta
would not have told you about him."  He looked away, and a certain
sadness seem to settle over him like a cloak.
<p>
"Diive? Was he a friend of yours?"
<p>
"No, he.. died before I became an adult warrior. But we all.. knew."
Raditz's knuckles were white where he clenched the railing. "Diive was
Nappa's eldest, his favorite and favored son. He was an elite warrior
like his father, and led the attack on many tough, civilized worlds,
and would handle the surrenders of those we or Frieza permitted to
survive as slaves. That's where he got into trouble--he got to know
other peoples.. as people. Someone you could talk to, rather than just
mowing them down in battle." Raditz smiled wryly. "He committed the
cardinal sin of falling in love with a woman who was not Saiyajin."
<p>
Goku looked at his brother, questioning. "This is bad?"
<p>
"For our ways, our customs then--yes. Remember, we saw non-Saiyajin as
little better than animals. I suppose a low-class warrior might dally
with some non-Saiyajin female and get away with it--but Diive was a
noble, and he didn't stop with an night's pleasure, he fell in love
with her, bonded with her, and brought her with him.  He rescued the
woman and her family and tried to protect them, when the order was to
clear her world."
<p>
"By 'clear', you mean murder all of them!"
<p>
"Yes, I mean exactly that. I think Diive might have gotten away with
it even so, except for one thing--he was Nappa's son, and Nappa had
enemies. There was a faction that didn't like Nappa or his influence
with the Prince, and wanted him ousted--which is another way of saying
killed, of course--and their own man to replace Nappa as Prince
Vegeta's teacher. Somehow they found out about Diive's indiscretion,
and brought the matter before the king, in open court."  Raditz bowed
his head before continuing.
<p>
"It couldn't be ignored then, and the challenge to Nappa was also an
challenge to the king, as the conspirators well knew.  They probably
thought that Nappa would try to defend his son, and the king would be
forced to remove--sorry, kill--Nappa to show his power to those who
defied his authority." Raditz was grim. "Nappa did what he had to do;
he condemned his own son, and carried out the execution himself."
<p>
"What Diive did was treason, though now I can finally see that he did
it for love and there was no harm in it for the Saiyajin, and he died
a traitor's death. Blinded, mutilated, staked out in the desert to die
by no man's hand--a slave's death, not a warrior's--dishonored and his
name forgotten and cursed. And before he was executed, Diive was
forced to watch the deaths of his mate and her family."
<p>
He looked away for a moment. "Nappa was never the same afterwards.
After that, he led the attacks on the toughest alien worlds, and his
ruthlessness was unparalleled, even for a Saiyan...."
<p>
Goku shuddered, remembering the huge Saiyan's brutal attacks on Gohan
and his friends. "You think you'd have died like Diive if you'd
believed murdering people who weren't Saiyans was wrong?"
<p>
"I don't know, maybe, maybe not--I'm no noble--but that wasn't the
whole reason I told you about him--there is something else I need to
understand in all this."  Raditz looked at his brother.
<p>
"Diive is not in Hell. The 'despised traitor' found a better place in
the end, and those of us who learned well the lessons of our race and
followed our warrior ideal--we were damned. Kakarott, how did we go so
terribly wrong?"
<p>
Goku was silent for a long moment. "You stopped listening to your
hearts."
<p>
"What do you-- oh." Raditz clenched the rail tightly again, almost
breaking the wrought iron. No need to ask.. I know, he thought,
remembering.
<p>
It was his first adult mission, "clearing" a world.  The locals had
fought bravely, but futilely, their primitive technology and courage
no match for Saiyan fury--but they looked far too much like
Saiyans.  It would have been easy to kill purple sponge-headed
aliens or pink lizardoids--they weren't 'people'. But
these--too much like Saiyajin without tails.  It had been his luck to
find, not warriors, but the secret place where they'd hidden their
women and children.
<p>
When the woman faced him, a woman his mother's age and build, holding
in her arms a infant that could have been his little brother, he'd
hesitated. His heart, his feelings recoiled from what he was here to
do, everything he'd been taught--
<p>
--and then the bright flash as the blast came in from over his
shoulder, disintegrating them.  Sub-Commander Kale (later Commander),
the squad leader, glared at him.  His face softened for an instant as
he saw who it was.
<p>
"First mission jitters, kid? Get over it. Remember, once he's found
the enemy, a true warrior never hesitates to kill even his own
brother.  Now get over to quadrant 3, we think there's another nest to
clear out."
<p>
Raditz had saluted, and complied. The next time, Kale was there
watching again, and Raditz just shut out his feelings and did what
he'd been sent to do. It became easier and easier over time; every
mission, every kill added another layer of armor around his heart.
<p>
And yet.. I never enjoyed killing in cold blood. In the heat of
battle, yes--I fight without restraint, with all the fury of a Saiyan
warrior, dealing death without remorse to those who oppose me-- but
there's no.. honor, no joy in slaughtering defenseless victims. I did
it for long years and to countless people--but I never liked it. Not
like some.  It was always a distasteful task, one that had to be done,
but not sought after--and never indulged in wantonly.
<p>
Kakarott never knew, during my first visit to Earth, how lucky his
friends were. I could have killed Kulilin, Bulma, the Elder Roshi,
those other strange creatures in the blink of an eye. I could have
obliterated all of the towns and cities I flew near while searching
for my brother.  I did not--because I just didn't want to.
<p>
The worst thing I did was try to force my brother to kill them.  I
knew that after he'd killed a hundred people, felt them die under his
hand, he'd have learned to shut away those weak feelings of his,
learned to harden his heart. I'm glad, now, that he refused.. I'm glad
Kakarott didn't let me make him just like me.
<p>
And then that last fight--when I had Kakarott down, at my mercy.. 'A
true warrior never hesitates to kill, even his own brother'. THEN my
heart rebelled; I could not kill him. I could not stop killing him
either--the battle had gone too far, and rage and pride would not
allow me to stop or surrender then.
<p>
"Raaa-ditz? Chi-chi's not going to like it if you wreck the porch."
Goku's gentle rebuke brought Raditz out of his dark spiral
thoughts. He was startled to see the wrought-iron rail bent and
crumpled in his grip.
<p>
"Oops. Sorry." With an effort, Raditz straighted the railing out
again. "You were right. How did you know?" He looked at Goku.
<p>
Goku looked back, dark saiyan eyes into dark saiyan eyes. The face so
similar to his own, just enough different--slightly finer, more
delicate features--and a characteristic scowl that Goku never had, and
looking out of those eyes, a soul so very different--or perhaps not,
Goku reflected. What would he have been, had he not struck his head
and lost all memory of himself as a child? Once, at King Kai's, he'd
had a vision of himself as a Saiyan warrior, arrogant and sneering. It
had chilled him to the soul, and he'd passionately rejected all
connection with his Saiyan heritage.
<p>
It was many years before Goku realized that King Kai had feared that
by training Goku, he might create a far worse threat to Earth and the
galaxy than Vegeta or even Frieza--that what returned to Earth might
become Kakarott, and not Goku. When he became the Super-Saiyajin..
Goku thought King Kai feared he'd truly become Kakarott. Even Gohan
had been shocked by his anger--until he'd experienced it himself. He,
Goku, had always been so mild--so few things truly angered him, that
there were very few indeed who'd ever seen him deeply angry.
<p>
Goku smiled to himself. If they'd only known! There was no Kakarott,
no Saiyan warrior lurking in him waiting to come out--the anger was
his own. Few things angered him, but the deaths of those he loved
always did. Death was the one enemy he couldn't fight in battle,
couldn't subdue--though with the dragonballs, sometimes they'd even
defeated death. He remembered the terrible, helpless rage that tore
through him for days when his grandfather Gohan had been killed. Rage
and hate for whatever had killed him (not knowing until years later
that he had killed Grandpa himself, as an ouzaru), anger at Grandpa
for dying and leaving him, anger at himself for not being there and
somehow helping Grandpa, anger so intense that he shook, remembering
it.
<p>
"Kakarott? What's wrong?" There was an uncharacteristic look of
concern on Raditz's face.
<p>
"Just memories." Goku sighed. "How did I know? My heart is MY guide;
if I did not listen to it, even when crazy Super-Saiyajin.. I would
have hurt Gohan, maybe killed him when he disobeyed me on Namek--I was
crazy-mad Super Saiyajin, and so worried/angry he hadn't left; Vegeta
would've been killed on Earth--and not alive and saving Gohan on
Namek; and I wouldn't have let go your tail and given YOU another
chance.."
<p>
There was no reproach in Goku's voice, but Raditz winced anyway.
"Which I promptly blew, and went on to make a complete ass of
myself. A dead ass." He looked away.
<p>
Goku looked intently at his brother until he looked back. "..and I
wouldn't have given you a chance when I found you holding my son Goten
up there in the mountains."
<p>
Raditz eyes widened in shock. "But I didn't.."
<p>
"Yah, I know that now--but then? Big shock, seeing you there, ALIVE,
with little Goten in your arms. Brought back nightmares of you with
Gohan. Part of me said 'kill, before he hurts Goten'.  Heart said
'Goten is happy, Raditz is YOUR BROTHER, give him a chance, maybe some
good here'. Good thing I listen to my heart, yes?"
<p>
"Uh, yeah." Raditz was still shaken; he managed to smile
weakly. "Getting killed twice in one day would have been..
depressing. And I'd have had a hell of a time explaining it to
father."
<p>

The World Tree groaned. Yggdrasil shifted; its third root, sunk in
Elivagar's well, was cracked and twisted; it could no longer bear its
share of the load. In time it would heal and regrow, but for
now--Yggdrasil shifted.  The Nine Worlds, bound together by the World
Tree, shifted in alignment to one and other; old pathways closed, new
pathways opened. Midgard and Niflheim drifted farther apart; Hell and
Earth warped closer together.
<p>
On Midgard (Earth), an ancient avatar of destruction slumbered deep
beneath the ocean's floor. Faint echoes of the World Shift disturbed
its endless sleep. One gigantic eyelid opened the merest hair, and
slow cold thoughts stirred in the monstrous brain.
<p>
"What has disturbed me? Is it the Black Star Dragonballs?" Some time
later, more sluggish thoughts trickled through its consciousness. "No,
no one summons me. Is it Ragnorak?" The mighty body, long endless
coils of draconic might buried beneath all the oceans of the world,
shifted and shuddered in the monster's troubled sleep. "No, the Aesir
do not stir abroad, and Fenris still groans in his bonds. Something
else.."
<p>
Jormungund the World Serpent drowsed, still gripping his tail between
his jaws, writhing and shuddering in his troubled dreams.  The whole
Earth trembled.

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Tremors">XIII. TREMORS</A></H1>
<p>
Darkness, lit only by luminous green flashes like lightning, settled
over Niflheim. The very air grew still; howling winter winds fell
silent, snow ceased its eternal fall. A dreadful anticipation hung
over the frigid underworld. Only one thing moved, a bright golden
flame that hurtled through the air towards the mouth of the Gioll
river.
<p>
Then it began: tiny wavelets criss-crossed the Gioll, an irregular
chop that mirrored not the absent wind, but a vibration in the earth
itself. Soon the banks and hills shook with that vibration, banks
collapsing into the river, hills rippling like sea-waves, shedding
themselves in landslides. Snow and ice that had frozen in place since
the dawn of time roared down in avalanches.  Here and there, the
ground cracked open; soon the very air seemed to groan. The World
Shift had begun.
<p>
Vegeta's eyes widened in dismay as he beheld the dark, nameless sea
heaving and tossing in chaotic disarray, dark spray breaking high up
on the bone-white beach. His gaze ran up and down the length of the
barren island at the mouth of the river as he hovered, Princess Kadru
in his arms. Where was the damned ship?
<p>
Ah, there it was! Beyond the snake-walled Hall of Torment, on the
ocean shore of Naastrand--as he'd expected, but had almost missed it
as the waves washed high on the shore. Nailfarer Naglfar, the boat of
dead men's nails, was nearly awash in the seething dark tide. Vegeta
frowned as he descended; the pale gleaming ship had a crew.
<p>
Dead men lined its deck, some black and bloated with decay, some the
glistening white of the long drowned--all red-eyed and baleful. Axes
and swords lifted as Vegeta approached. The dead prince smirked, and
stretched out his one good hand--
<p>
--and fell! He'd circled over the sea, and the instant he passed over
the water, the power of flight left Vegeta, and he plummeted into the
icy dark water, hair fading to black again. Kadru splashed down beside
him.
<p>
COLD! The shock of it would have killed him, were he living. Only the
warmth enfolding him from the wolf-fur, and the wolf-blood within kept
Vegeta moving; the dead prince surfaced, sputtering seawater and
shivering with the bitter cold. Kadru..
<p>
..was being dragged onto the deck of Nailfarer Naglfar by red-eyed
corpses. She thrashed and struggled in her human form, but to no
avail. "Here's something to warm a dead man's bones!" "I saw her
first, she's mine!" "Share and share alike, lads!"
<p>
Hmmph. With any luck, they'll tear each other apart over her. Vegeta
swam quickly to the ship of dead men, and hauled himself out by the
bowpost. His brief climb took him out of view of Kadru and her undead
captors; in that time, they fell suddenly silent, and there came a
great sigh, like an indrawn breath. What the hell?
<p>
Vegeta pulled himself over the side onto the deck. The dead men all
backed away from Kadru as she reared up, transformed into a
Naga-woman. She hissed at them, fangs bared; Vegeta marked the terror in
her eyes. "Aiyeee! A snake demon!"  "'Ware her venom!"  "I wanted to
kiss THAT??"
<p>
Oh, this is good! They are as scared of her as she is of them--and
everyone is ignoring me! Not so good. Vegeta scowled and stepped
forward.
<p>
"The snake-woman is with ME! If you don't like her, leave! If you like
her, leave--I don't like you on MY ship!" Vegeta scowled; he hadn't
meant to say it quite that way.
<p>
The dead warriors turned as one to stare at the diminuitive Saiyan
prince. "Who's the runt?" "Got nerve, ordering us off our ship like
HE'S the captain!" "He's not Loki, that's for sure!" "Doesn't look so
tough!"
<p>
A tall, red-bearded wight stepped forward, wielding an axe in his
right hand and carelessly dangling a shield in the other hand. His
armor and decayed flesh showed the marks of many swords and axe blows;
the warrior had not died easily. He glared at Vegeta, burning red gaze
locked into intense dark Saiyan eyes.
<p>
"Well, goblin?" the dead Viking growled. "Your words are empty boasts,
runt--you've not a mark on you. Died in your sleep, did you?  Probably
poisoned by a woman," the warrior sneered.
<p>
Vegeta's eyes went wide, and his brows lowered with anger. The veins
stood out on the side of his head. "SHUT UP, YOU FILTH!" Faster than
anyone could see, the dead prince lashed out, and the red-bearded
warrior's head tumbled from his half-skeletal corpse. Corpse and head
hit the deck, and slowly crumbled to dust as a high-pitched wail
marked the passing of the broken spirit.
<p>
Vegeta did not stop to watch; he charged through the throng of evil
dead, breaking and shattering them before they were more than barely
aware of the first warrior's fate. He stood, panting; the deck was
clear of all save himself and Kadru.
<p>
He looked quickly around, and cursed. More dead men were coming from
all around the shore.  In the other direction-- a great dark wave
filled the horizon.
<p>
"Hurry!" Vegeta called to Kadru. He raised one hand, and blasted the
cable tying the baleful ship to Naastrand's shore. "Get the sail up on
this wretched excuse for a boat, and hang on! If we're not well out to
sea when that wave hits, we're done!"
<p>
"How? I do not know how to sail a ship!" Princess Kadru wailed.
<p>
"Useless idiot snake!" Vegeta cursed as he gathered energy in his
right hand. He squinted at the dark shore; a single figure was clawing
and fighting its way through the pack of dead men toward them. Vegeta
frowned; something familiar about that one..
<p>
He glanced over his shoulder; the wave was closer! No time to worry
about the stranger now--Vegeta lifted his hand and flung energy in a
steady, powerful blast that scattered the walking dead warriors--and,
with a grinding lurch that nearly knocked him off his feet, sent the
ship surging out to sea.
<p>
The dead prince noted with some curiousity that the stranger managed
to dive out of the way of his blast, and was running.. now leaping
into the waves and grabbing something.. the mooring rope!  Nailfarer's
severed mooring rope trailed in the water behind the baleful ship, and
the stranger was hauling himself along it hand over hand. Vegeta
smirked, and raised a hand-- and Kadru screamed behind him.
<p>
Prince Vegeta whirled--the great wave was on them! Nailfarer's bow
rose with the wave, up, up and up until Vegeta thought the whole ship
must surely fall over backwards. Kadru coiled tightly around the mast,
clinging with the same dogged tenacity that had marked her climb up
Yggdrasil's icy root; Vegeta braced himself against the sternpost. The
whole ship seemed to climb to the summit of a dark watery hill, the
bow hanging over nothing but air--and then over, and Nailfarer crashed
down!
<p>
Now Vegeta clung to the sternpost with both arms and all his strength
as Nailfarer plunged down the slope of the wave as steeply as it had
risen. His eyes widened as the ship plunged down and down; surely
nothing could stop it from diving deep into the sea behind the wave!
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Nothing stopped it; the bow drove deep into the dark water, and the
icy torrent poured over the deck, drenching Kadru and Vegeta both. The
flood dragged at Vegeta with frigid fingers, trying to tear him loose
and pull him under the waves forever. He defied it with all his will
and spirit, and stayed with the ship.
<p>
For endless moments the ship staggered under the black water; Vegeta
began to wonder if they would hit the bottom of the dark ocean first,
or return to the surface someday. Finally, Nailfarer shuddered and
broke the surface, wallowing in the dark waves. Vegeta opened his
eyes, and shook the water from his hair.
<p>
Kadru clung weakly to mast, coughing up water. She looked bedraggled
and miserable; most of her bridal gold had been torn away and lost by
the fierce current. Her wolf coat was sodden and torn; Vegeta's hadn't
fared much better. Only the wolf blood within still kept him warm.
<p>
Well, well! That peach did her some good--she would have drowned or
frozen, probably both, if she were still purely mortal. "Stupid snake!
What did you think you were doing, interfering with me at Elivagar?"
<p>
Princess Kadru looked up from her own misery, and looked, in turns,
puzzled, thoughtful, then finally indignant. "You promised to find me
a suitable husband! I thought you were going to leave me with that
ugly worm!  I don't know what you thought, not-husband, but a dumb
corpse-eating worm that chews tree roots is NOT suitable!"
<p>
"Snake-woman, I--" Vegeta broke off abruptly, sensing movement behind
him. His head snapped around, and he raised his good hand, gathering
energy.
<p>
One skeletal hand already gripped the gunwale, and as Vegeta watched,
another joined it, and a helmeted skull rose into sight as the long-dead
warrior started to climb aboard.
<p>
"I thought we lost you when the wave hit," Vegeta snarled, as he held
his hand out--and stopped abruptly.  His eyes widened; he recognized
the long blond braided hair hanging from the otherwise bare
skull. "Modgudh! What??"
<p>
A ghost's hollow chuckle; "That large, out-of-place demon you were
looking for?  He showed up," Modgudh said very dryly. "Perhaps I
should ask permission to come aboard, first," the undead guard
answered. "May I?" Hollow eyesockets regarded Vegeta's outstretched
hand.
<p>
"Hmmph! Come aboard, then! I want to hear why the guard of the Gioll
Bridge is here, aboard my boat." Vegeta lowered his hand, and Modgudh
resumed climbing aboard.
<p>
"YOUR boat?" Modgudh laughed. "Them as built it might think different,
but piracy is a fine old tradition in the North, so 'tis yours by
right of possession, indeed." She seemed very amused. "I didn't mark
you as one to be going a-viking, but I don't argue with reality,
either. Stealing Nailfarer! Ah, this is rich!"
<p>
Prince Vegeta folded his arms, and waited, scowling. The incongruity
of Modgudh's rich, feminine voice coming from the bare bones of a
long-dead warrior maid disturbed him, and her laughter even more
so. Presently, Modgudh stopped laughing.
<p>
"Your large, out-of-place demon has made one hell of a mess--crashing
his way out of Elivagar, splintering Yggdrasil's root.. oh, and
destroying the Gioll Bridge on the way past.  No bridge, no need for a
guardian, and I am freed from my geas. You're on your way out of
Niflheim, so I followed, and here I am." She looked around at the
ship. "That may have been a mistake."
<p>
"What??" Vegeta looked around, suddenly aware of the condition of the
ship. The mast ended a few feet above Kadru's head, snapped off
abruptly. Sections of the gunwale and thwarts appeared partly
crumbled, and the ship wallowed broadside to the waves. The saiyan
found the alternate sinking and heaving up, combined with a certain
lurching to and fro, very unpleasant.  From the look on Kadru's face
as she hurriedly slithered toward the rail, she found it more than
unpleasant.
<p>
This is what humans put up with before they learned to build real
ships and aircraft??  For such fragile creatures, they have
extraordinary tenacity and courage!
<p>
"You're going to have trouble going anywhere--no sail, and looks like
you lost your steering oar," Modgudh observed. She lifted up one of
the planks laid between the thwarts, and peered into the
bilge. "You're taking on water; she must be holed somewhere.  I always
did think dead men's fingernails was a stupid material to build a ship
out of. No strength to it, and it crumbles at the joins between nails."
<p>
"Taking on water?" Vegeta's eyebrows arched, and he looked
worried. That did not sound good, nor did 'missing a steering oar',
whatever THAT was.
<p>
"As in, 'we're sinking'. Slowly." She looked down in the bilge
again. "I suggest that you find the hole and patch it, and then
someone start bailing."  The skeletal woman finally let the plank
drop.
<p>
"Bailing?" Vegeta looked puzzled.
<p>
"Yes, bailing. You know, scooping the water out of the bilge and
tossing it back over the side where it belongs?" Her bare skull tilted
a bit to the side. "You're not a sailor, are you?"
<p>
"Saiyans FLY, we don't float around on driftwood like lizards! And why
can't I fly here?" Vegeta snarled.
<p>
"Hel's curse; what she gets, she keeps.  She does not permit the
spirits of the dead to simply flit across the Endless Ocean and escape
her realm and their punishment. Nor may any ship made of wood or hide
sail from Niflheim's shore--that is why the evil dead built Nailfarer
Naglfar, this ship of dead men's nails."
<p>
"Hmmph! So find the hole, and get Kadru to fix it before we're all
swimming--she seems good at that sort of thing. I'll worry about how
to get this barge moving!" He leaped to the top of the sternpost, and
looked out across the sunless sea.
<p>
"Why do 'hell' and 'too dark to see your hand in front of your face'
seem to go together?" Vegeta growled to no one in particular. He
lifted his arm, and a ball of white light began to form in his cupped
hand. It blazed brighter and brighter until no one could endure
looking at; then Vegeta lowered his arm, wound up, and pitched it high
into the non-sky above the Endless Ocean.
<p>
It exploded into a slowly expanding disk of light, illuminating the
ocean for countless miles. Even the sea turned translucent under that
relentless glare, and nameless fish-things dove deep, fleeing the
terrible light.
<p>
"Ah!" Vegeta exclaimed as he looked across the ocean, sheltering his
eyes from the glare.  "Look!" he shouted, pointing.  Modgudh and Kadru
looked up from their task.
<p>
In the distance, a small black-hulled ship cut through the waves, a
single black squaresail driving it before the wind. It was not so
long as Nailfarer, but rounder and stouter. Prince Vegeta squinted; a
single figure stood at the stern, gripping a great oar--so that's what
a 'steering oar' is!--guiding the ship. As Vegeta watched, the ship
came around, and bore straight for them.
<p>
Kadru was bewildered, "I can't see anything!"
<p>
Modgudh lifted a skeletal hand to shade empty eyesockets. "A knarr of
sorts, though I don't recognize the design. Who sails this sea?"
<p>
"We'll soon find out," answered Vegeta. "Is that hole fixed yet?"
<p>
"Holes," corrected Modgudh. "And I think there's a weak spot in the
hull that may split entirely before long." At Vegeta's look of
annoyance, Modgudh snapped, "it takes more than thirty seconds to find
and fix these things!" Modgudh looked under the planking
again. "Vegeta, give me that fur cloak of yours; we've already used
Kadru's."
<p>
"WHAT?" Vegeta scowled, eyebrows lowering.
<p>
"Would you rather swim?" Modgudh doffed her helmet and tossed it to
Kadru. "As soon as you seal the other big one, start bailing," the
undead warrior maid instructed the naga princess.
<p>
Vegeta scowled even more fiercely, but took off the wolf-cloak and
tossed it to Modgudh, who promptly handed it to Kadru in the
bilge. "At least I know a better way to get rid of the water than
laddling it with a spoon!" He furrowed his brow, concentrating;
suddenly, the whole ship lurched as a single huge blob of water rose
out of the bilge into the air.  Vegeta gestured, and the amorphous
thing tipped over, and slid into sea. Modgudh's jaw dropped; Kadru sat
up, wide-eyed.
<p>
"Now, let us go meet that black ship!" Vegeta faced the stern and held
his one good hand out, concentrating. The pale ship shuddered, and
surged forward; the waves flattened astern as the force of Vegeta's
will beat against them.

<p>
On Earth, Sinhika smiled to herself, pleased. She sat quietly waiting
in the outer office of Capsule Corp's personnel director, filling out
the paperwork for her new job.  Sean had come through with flying
colors, helping her put together a plausible resume, and she'd
supplied the requisite references from memory--all Night Wanderers,
who would know her name and happily attest that the Princess of Lankha
was whatever and whoever she claimed to be, and good at the job, too.
<p>
Sinhika felt no qualms at the deception; illusion and deception were
survival to the Rakshasas--and she did have the skills she
claimed. She simply hadn't acquired all the major languages of India,
and deep knowledge of its customs and ways in quite the way her resume
claimed she had.
<p>
Capsule Corp needed an expert translator and "cultural advisor" for
Marketing's Indian subdivision; Sinhika needed a job, and knew better
than to argue with Fate. In a short while, she would be Capsule Corp's
newest employee. She turned in the completed paperwork to the fellow
behind the desk--pleasantly young, but a bit too plump to interest her
as a man, and too nice to interest her as dinner.
<p>
"Miss Manohara?" the nice, plump young man handed her another folder
full of forms. "You need to take these over to Security, and get your
badge. I hope you enjoy working with us," he smiled.
<p>

<p>
Raditz frowned as the building shook again. Another minor earthquake!
That had to be the fifteenth one in as many hours; what the hell was
going on? Even the people who worked here who had dismissed the first
few as "just the usual tremors" were starting to look rattled.
<p>
The big Saiyan growled and glanced at the sheaf of paper in his hand:
the criminal records of the four kidnappers he'd disposed of. He'd
known that humans were insanely fond of records and forms of all
kinds, but keeping performance records on criminals struck him as
downright odd. Of course, on Vegetasai they'd simply have been
executed the first time, and wouldn't need records after that.
<p>
Hiregumi claimed to be old-fashioned; he preferred to brief all of his
security force--including Raditz--in person. Raditz wasn't quite sure
what was old-fashioned about that--in the Royal Guard, he'd have been
briefed personally about all the usual suspects to keep an eye on, but
humans seemed to go out of their way to find the most impersonal way
possible to do things. He'd seen some of Bulma's flunkies spend half
an hour sending electronic messages across the same damn room, instead
of getting up off their lazy butts and taking the ten seconds to walk
over! Idiots.
<p>
Hiregumi had come through, using whatever connections he had for
tracing licenses and names. Goten and Chi-chi's kidnappers turned out
to be even slimier than Raditz would have believed possible--Saiyans
might be brutal killers, but this kind of depravity--never! Well,
perhaps there had been a few, in history, who were insane enough to do
<i>once</i> the kinds of things these four had been suspected of doing
repeatedly for years. Raditz couldn't remember hearing of any such,
though.
<p>
Now I have to find out why these filth were hooked up with that demon,
and why they went after Goten.  And what the hell is that
demon-dinosaur, anyway? Does it have anything to do with the thing
that killed Vegeta?  Musing over these thoughts, Raditz made for the
bare corner office that officially belonged to him, but that he
actually used for about five minutes, once a week at most.
<p>
As he walked, Raditz barely noticed the shapely black-haired clerical
assistant bent over a bottom-row filing drawer, short skirt hiked up
to an indecent height by her current position, even though he had to
squeeze past her.  He closed the door to his office, completely
oblivious to the frustrated glare she gave his departing back--or
rather, hair.
<p>
She stood up abruptly, and viciously kicked the filing cabinet closed.
She returned to her desk, and her co-worker, a pert short-haired
brown-haired girl wearing glasses.
<p>
"Well, Lina?" the short-haired girl asked anxiously. "Did he?"
<p>
"No--Nezumi, he didn't even LOOK at me! My skirt was hiked up to THERE,"
Lina drew a line on her thigh with her finger, "and you know how low
this blouse hangs when I bend over--he just ignored me! This is the
fifth time either you or I has tried to catch his eye, and nothing!
Nada, zip, zilch, zero, strike out! Just our luck--the one
good-looking new guy in the whole place, and he's gay!"
<p>
"Maybe he's married, or already has a girl.." Nezumi suggested.
<p>
"Nope, no ring. I looked. Besides, Kidoru is married, and that doesn't
stop him from looking and grabbing, the pig! And if he had a girl,
there'd be clues, and he'd act.. different. Bad boys will still show
interest, and nice guys with a girl will show strong non-interest, if
you know what I mean.  Either this guy is gay, or utterly clueless, or
dead--and he moves around too much to be dead," Lina pronounced with
finality.
<p>
Nezumi sighed, a forlorn, bereft sound. "Well, at least there's hope if
it's just cluelessness."
<p>
"If it's cluelessness, he's terminal! I think I could lounge naked on
his desk and he'd probably push me aside to look at the computer or
something!" Lina snorted in disgust.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Kidoru jerked his head up, startled, when Lina knocked on his office
door. He hurriedly shoved the magazine he'd been reading (a title
Master Roshi would have recognized at once) into the top drawer and
straightened his tie.  He was a thirty-something man with crooked
teeth and slick black hair, badly cut. His clothes were equally
unfashionable.
<p>
"Yes?" He asked his assistant somewhat harshly, and then
frowned. There was someone with Lina, a woman--his eyes widened--a
gorgeous woman with orange hair!
<p>
"Mr. Kidoru, this is Sinhika Manohara, our newest employee. Personnel
just sent her over to get her badge and clearances taken care of."
Lina smiled a nice plastic smile for her boss.
<p>
Kidoru didn't even look at her; his eyes were entirely on
Sinhika. "Come in, come in, Miss Manohara. Won't you sit down? You can
leave now, Lina," he added absently.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"Who's the new girl?" asked Nezumi.
<p>
"See for yourself," Lina said as she passed Sinhika's resume and
application forms to her friend. "She got that Indian Division
marketing spot that was open."
<p>
"Oh, so she won't be stuck here with "The Fastest Hands in the East"?
Lucky girl!" Nezumi made a derisive gesture in the direction of Kidoru's
closed door.
<p>
"Looks like she'll be reporting directly to the VP, or maybe the Boss
Herself." Lina raised an eyebrow, impressed.
<p>
"I wish we did--the Boss would never put up with Kidoru if she saw
what he was like." Nezumi sighed.
<p>
"The trouble is, he's actually competent enough at his job to keep it,
and he doesn't act like a pig when anyone whose paycheck he doesn't
sign is around.  Hmmm.. well, Mr. Gay-or-Clueless there," Lina pointed
down the hall at Raditz's office door, "is the Boss's personal
bodyguard; he reports to Her all the time.  I wonder..."
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Sinhika decided that if Kidoru tried to grope her one more time, he
was going to be picking his teeth up out of the corner of the room,
job or no job.  Besides, she could always re-apply for the job under
another name and face.  First, she thought, let's try the playing the
"customs and manners" card.
<p>
"Excuse me," she said frostily. "In my country, it is not customary
for a man to be so.. forward to any except his wife--in the privacy of
their home.  Is this your way of proposing marriage?" Sinhika managed
to look innocent and puzzled.
<p>
"Um, er, I.." Kidoru stammered, turning red. "It was just a joke, sort
of. I'm sorry; just fill out these forms and take them to..." he
paused, casting around for someone to dump this embarassing young
woman on. "Take them to Raditz-san, his office is just around the
corner and across the hall."
<p>
Sinhika raised one eyebrow, then left the office. Kidoru wiped the
sweat off his brow; thank the gods! If she'd reported his behavior as
some kind of proposal--he didn't want to think how much troubled he'd
be in. Especially with his wife, and that old battle-axe mother of
hers! Besides, he smirked, time that long-haired weirdo Raditz pulled
his own weight around here!  Kidoru didn't care what Hiregumi or
Bulma Briefs said about him being Mrs. Brief's <i>personal</i> bodyguard,
it wasn't fair that he didn't do his share of the regular work!
<i>Personal</i> bodyguard--huh! Kidoru could guess what kind of <i>personal</i>
services Raditz provided--look at how all the office girls drooled
over him. Shameless!
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz started at the sudden knock. What the hell? No one but Hiregumi
had the temerity to interrupt him when he had the door closed. Was
something wrong? He put away the book he'd borrowed from Gohan
("<i>Introduction to World History, 5th Ed.</i>"), curled his tail back
around his waist, and growled, "Come in! What the hell is it?"
<p>
The door opened part way, and the beautiful dusky face of Sinhika
Manohara peered around the edge of the door. "Raditz-san?" she asked
uncertainly, holding up a folder full of papers as she pushed the door
the rest of the way open. "Mr. Kidoru sent me to--"
<p>
Raditz stood up abruptly. His huge, knee-length mane of hair added to
his imposing six-foot-plus height seemed to overwhelm the small
office; Sinhika stepped back involuntarily. He folded his muscular
arms and frowned slightly.
<p>
"Kidoru has overstepped himself," the big man said in a soft, fierce
voice. "I am a warrior--er, guard, not a clerk!" Sinhika barely heard
him; her nostrils flared, and one eyebrow went up; there was
something.. familiar about his accent, and the shape of his
face.. Then her gaze fell on the brown fur "belt" wrapped around his
waist--an odd ornament for the simple dark jeans and grey shirt Raditz
wore--and her eyes widened.
<p>
She smiled, and ducked her head bashfully under his fierce gaze. "I'm
sorry, I'm new, I must have misunderstood. Perhaps one of the ladies
can help me..." Sinhika looked at Raditz again, her voice full of
innocence, her smile and eyes wicked as sin. "Again, I am very sorry
that I disturbed you." Her voice and smile suggested that she wasn't
the least bit sorry as she backed away, and gently closed the door
behind her.
<p>
Raditz blinked; he'd missed something! That face--that orange hair!
SHE was the girl who danced in the street, the one with power, the one
who had.. desired him. Well, one of several, he smirked to
himself. So.. Damn! What an idiot he was!--he hadn't even bothered to
learn her name! Well, if she was working here, he'd run into her
again--he was sure she'd make sure of that. Heh.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Nezumi finished typing up Sinhika's paperwork after she left. She
sighed. "It's hopeless. He must be gay--he chased HER out of his
office? No normal man could be THAT clueless!"
<p>
Lina frowned. "Maybe not," she said. "He IS a professional bodyguard,
not a clerk--Kidoru shouldn't have sent her to Raditz, he did that
just for spite, I'll bet.  Maybe the big guy's cluelessness is
professionalism--you know, he concentrates on protecting the Boss,
doesn't have time for stray femmes like us." Lina smiled wryly.
<p>
Nezumi snorted in disgust. "Listen, I'm the ex-cop here, and most of the
cops I knew behaved like professionals on the job--and the only cops I
knew who would ignore women like he does were either gay or serious
family men." She shook her head. "No, I'm starting to think you were
right the first time.  What a shame!"
<p>

<p>
Late that evening, Kidoru parked his car, locked it, and hastened down
the dark street toward his apartment. Working late at Capsule
Corp. was one thing, but coming home late was not so good; Jade would
be angry again, and scream at him about spoiling dinner. Preocupied
with these woeful thoughts, he didn't know anything was wrong until
something grabbed him from behind, and a strong hand was clapped over
his mouth to muffle his cries...

<p>
It moaned. Above the floor of the abandoned quarry, a dark whirling
void danced and moaned. Firelight and torchlight shed no light into
its depths, nor did they do more than deepen the giant shadow standing
by the makeshift altar.
<p>
"Throw him in," grated the shadow's voice.
<p>
Rough hands picked up the bound and gagged Kidoru and lifted him up;
the gag was ripped away, and two men seized him by his hands and
feet. They held him for a few moments, laughing at his screams of
terror; then they heaved his body into the center of the wailing void.
<p>
A shriek of horrid pain, cut off abruptly--then something dropped
heavily from the vortex. It scratched at the ground, and painfully
staggered erect, as the moaning void turned into itself and
dissipated. Something man-like and goat-headed blinked at the
firelight, looking around.  Finally the broo beheld the shadowy
Keikan-Ma and prostrated itself before him.
<p>
The powerful demon seized the broo by his stubby goat horns and hauled
him erect, studying him. Keikan-Ma tossed him aside. "He is weak," the
demon growled. "Kaeru, you chose poorly."  The void began to form
above the altar, again.
<p>
"But Master! You told us to seek priests and warriors and magical
creatures--people with power! This one was a security officer--a
warrior--and had power in his company!" The man backed away,
terrified.
<p>
"FOOL!" the demon growled as he strode forward and grabbed the
panicking cultist. "He was WEAK, and so are you!" Keikan-Ma picked up
the screaming, begging cultist and threw him into the fully re-formed
chaos vortex.
<p>
An antelope-headed broo appeared, blinking; the great shadow demon
cuffed him to one side. "Sorceror!"
<p>
A tall, pale man dressed all in black stepped forward and bowed. "Yes,
Lord Keikan-Ma?"
<p>
"Teach these fools how to recognize power! Lord Dairi-Mao requires his
strongest broo, not the weakest ones! Take these broo, and train them,
make them stronger!"
<p>
The man in black bowed low again, long black hair hanging down to hide
his face, and bemused smirk. "Yes, my Lord Keikan-Ma. It shall be
done."
<p>
"Of course; there is no other possibility." Keikan-Ma turned to
another cultist. "Oshimu.." His voice grated slowly.
<p>
Oshimu, a muscular thug in dark jeans and tight black t-shirt,
paled. He gulped. "My Lord Keikan-Ma! Something powerful guards those
temples; none of my teams has survived to report! Even I barely
escaped the first one! I am not weak, but this is beyond me--we need
your great might," he said fawningly.
<p>
The shadow demon's fiery red eyes narrowed. It nodded, almost
reluctantly. "Prepare another assault on the first temple."
<p>
Oshimu took a step back, and prostrated himself. "Yes, my lord."  As
the ritual broke up, he left with the others; on Oshimu's face was the
look of one who knows his doom has come.

"..so if Mrs. Briefs requires extra security," Nezumi nodded at
Raditz, "I could fill in as her driver. If you recall my record with
the department, I have considerable experience in that area--
defensive driving instructor, high-speed pursuit driving, and so on."
Nezumi finished up her presentation to Mr. Hiregumi and Raditz.
<p>
She strove to maintain a serious face even though she was about to
burst with excitement. Kidoru hadn't come in to work today--it was
Friday, so Nezumi assumed he was taking a long weekend--and she'd
seized the opportunity to make her proposal to Mr. Hiregumi without
having to present it to Kidoru first.  From the thoughtful look on
Mr. Hiregumi's face, he was taking her proposal seriously.  She wasn't
sure about Raditz; he was standing with his arms folded, scowling, but
he seemed to do that all the time.
<p>
It was Raditz who spoke first. "Hiregumi-san.. do you trust her?"
<p>
Nezumi looked sharply at him, and curbed the indignant outburst that
sprang to her mind. Raditz's gaze was cold and measuring. He's trying
to decide if I'm someone he can trust with his principal's life, she
thought. Definitely a professional--maybe he's not gay or
clueless--just focussed. Really, really focussed.
<p>
Mr. Hiregumi nodded. "Yes, absolutely. I have known Nezumi since she
was a rookie in the City Police Department, and she has always been
exemplary." He smiled, bringing out the laugh wrinkles at the corner
of his eyes. "Occasionally she has been more.. enthusiastic in the
pursuit of her duties than some less talented individuals approved of,
but do not let that deceive you.  Her suggestion is excellent; I
recommend it strongly."
<p>
Wait a minute! Nezumi wondered; what's going on here? Mr. Hiregumi is
<i>recommending</i> something, not just ordering it done?  This is Raditz's
decision??  When did he become head of security?
<p>
Finally, Raditz nodded. "Very well."  He nodded to Mr. Hiregumi, and
turned to leave.  Part way down the hall, he looked back. "You coming?"
<p>
"Um, yes!" Nezumi hurried to catch up with him. "I need to get--"
<p>
"Worry about that later."
<p>
They were outside; he turned a corner into a little-frequented part of
the compound. As soon as Nezumi caught up with him, Raditz grabbed the
brown-haired girl and hauled her up close to his face.
<p>
"Hey! Put me d--" she broke off suddenly, noticing that "down" was
suddenly 20 feet below and receding fast. She paled.
<p>
"Now, tell me the REAL reason you made that proposal that puts you so
conveniently close to Bulma and Trunks!" Raditz growled softly.
<p>
Talk about professional paranoia! Keep your cool, girl. He's not going
to drop you--probably trying to see if you scare.  Sharp, though--he
figured out quick that I have an ulterior motive. Focussed, not
clueless.
<p>
"Two reasons: it gets me away from Kidoru, and it gets me conveniently
close to YOU," she answered pertly.
<p>
"ME??" Raditz's brows lowered.
<p>
"Think about it; you're a pretty suspicious character--coming out of
nowhere like that, no background, no references, no nothing, just
Bulma decreeing that you be here. Sure, I got the word that you're one
of Vegeta's people--but he came out of nowhere, too; I couldn't even
begin to list the wild rumors about him if I had all day! Some of us
have worked for the Briefs family for a long time, and don't want to
see anything bad happen to them."
<p>
Raditz's eyes widened. "Hiregumi-san put you up to this! You haven't
been here that long, but he's known Bulma's father for years! That
wily bastard!" Raditz smirked.  "You'll do. You've got nerve enough in
a tight spot." He descended rapidly, and they alighted on the
rooftop. "I won't ask if you can fight--that's my job.  You know where
to be and when--see you there."
<p>
Nezumi watched in wonder as Raditz rose high into the air above the
Capsule Corp compound and darted off into the sky.
<p>
"Wow. He can fly, too."

<p>
Deep in Hell, in the twisted, slimy canyons of the Pit of Worms,
Commander Kale was not so amused.
<p>
"Commander! We've found another one!" Negi called up from the canyon
below.
<p>
Kale waited for the second-class soldier to make his way up. "Another
what? I sincerely hope you mean 'another broo'."  The Saiyan commander
frowned.
<p>
Negi, a one-eyed scarred warrior of medium height with the usual
unruly black saiyan hair spilling down to below his shoulders, shook
his head slowly. "No, sir. Another human soul that didn't get here by
the usual route. I think they're somehow being switched for the broo."
<p>
Commander Kale stood up straight, all his attention on what Negi was
saying. "What? How do you know this?"
<p>
"The second guy.. he belonged to whoever's doing this. Said it was
some kind of ritual--they open a rift, toss someone in, get a broo
out. PHYSICALLY get a broo, sir!" Negi seemed unhappy to report it;
Kale was even more unhappy to hear it.
<p>
"Let me get this straight--someone on Earth is using ritual magic to
open a rift to Hell and summon broo demons bodily to Earth? That
should be impossible unless-- OH CRUD! Of course! It's a
substitution--the poor bastard that gets sacrificed provides the flesh
and bone for the broo spirit to occupy, reshaped to fit the
broo. Nasty." Kale thought a moment. "Humans are too weak to host most
of what we've been fighting for weeks.."
<p>
Negi nodded. "Sir, that would agree with what I've seen--the two souls
we picked up are weaklings, and the broo that disappeared may have
been some of the weaker ones--none of the big guys seems to have gone
missing, though I can't be sure yet.  They're smart enough to avoid
letting us come close enough to count noses." The dead saiyan warrior
smiled wryly.
<p>
Kale did not smile; rather, he looked as close as a Saiyan ever gets
to being sick to his stomach. "Go on back and find out what you
can--find out if there are any more of these substitutions. Don't lose
any of them, we'll have to deliver them all somewhere when this gets
sorted out.  Dismissed!"
<p>
"Yes, sir!" Negi saluted, and disappeared back down the canyon.
<p>
Kale sighed, and pulled his white commander's cloak close about
him. "King Vegeta's really going to love hearing about this. Souls
getting dragged to Hell without going through Lord Enma's
judgement--this one's going to kick crap loose all the way up the
hierarchy; just my luck to be the poor bastard it's all going to roll
downhill on top of."
<p>
He smiled bitterly to himself. "This is Hell, after all. I didn't get
sent here for the fun of it." Kale stood wearily. "Duty obliges; the
king must know of this madness."
<p>

<p>
"Prince Vegeta! He's turning alongside!" Skeletal Modgudh shouted from
her position on the bow.
<p>
Vegeta glanced over his shoulder; the oncoming ship was a scant score
of yards away. The steersman of the black ship leaned hard on his oar,
forcing the bow of the stout ship away from Nailfarer's hull. Vegeta
should have been able to see the steersman plainly now, but he seemed
cloaked in shadow; all the dead prince could make out were powerful
dark arms straining at the great oar.
<p>
A final burst of power, and Nailfarer surged forward, nearly colliding
with the other ship--
<p>
CRACK! Nailfarer shuddered, and wallowed into the waves.
<p>
"WHAT THE HELL?" shouted Vegeta, whirling around.
<p>
"DAMN THIS FLOATING PIECE OF CRAP--THE HULL'S SPLIT OPEN!" Modgudh
shouted, jumping down and racing back from her perch on the
bow. "We're breaking up!"
<p>
Kadru snapped out of her private miseries and looked about; her body
writhed and changed as she took two-legged human form again.  She
frantically tossed planks aside, probing in the water-filled
bilge--within seconds pulling out two armsfuls of sodden fur. The Naga
princess looked across the widening gap between Nailfarer and the
black ship, and hesitated; it seemed impossibly far to jump.
<p>
Nailfarer settled lower in the water every second; Vegeta moved. He
scooped Kadru under one arm and leaped to the deck of the black ship
in a single bound. After the slightest of hesitation, Modgudh followed
him. As before, she landed short, and found herself clinging to the
outer hull, her bony fingers hooked over the gunwale as she pulled
herself aboard.
<p>
Vegeta found himself looking up at the shadow-cloaked boatman, and
down at the boathook point inches from his chest. How had he moved so
fast? A moment ago, he was still at the oar!  Now the oar was lashed
down and this creature was staring him in the face!
<p>
It rumbled, "An unusual pick-up. Have you the fee?" Shadows cloaked
and cowled it, though Vegeta thought he saw the glimmer of teeth in
those shadows.
<p>
"What fee?" Vegeta snarled, bracing himself for a fight. He could
sense some of this thing's power, but most of it was obscured, hidden
from him.
<p>
"The Ferryman's Fee. I am the Ferryman. There is a fee for
transporting the dead, wherever they need to go." The Ferryman
explained patiently in his rumbling, bass voice. He tossed back his
shadowy cowl, revealing a dark, long-muzzled inhuman head.  White
tusks protruded from his strong jaws, while his eyes were mere
slits. Vegeta thought he could hear an odd high-pitched chirping as
the Ferryman cocked his head and looked them all over. "For the
living, I charge extra," he pointed one finger at Kadru.
<p>
Vegeta's eyebrows lowered; he looked more thoughtful than
angry. "WHEREVER we need to go? You could take me ANYWHERE I asked?"
<p>
"Wherever Styx flows. If you pay my fee."
<p>
Vegeta scowled, and turned abruptly to Kadru. He grabbed her arm and
stripped the remaining gold armlets off of her.  He thrust them at the
Ferryman. "Here! Is this enough, or must I give you the snake-wench,
too?"
<p>
"NO!" shrilled Kadru, who then took a second look at the
Ferryman. "Are you married?"
<p>
The Ferryman took Kadru's gold and examined it closely; Vegeta could
hear that strange chirping again.  "It will do." He cocked his head
and looked quizzically at Kadru. "You tasty?"
<p>
Kadru crossed her arms indignantly. "NO! I'm foul-tasting and probably
poisonous.. but I can cook."
<p>
Vegeta looked startled. Well, well--the snake-woman is getting a
backbone! And even showing a hint of wit...
<p>
"Hmmm.. Sit there and stay out of the way. You, pointy hair--you paid
the fee, where to?"
<p>
"The name," the Saiyan prince snarled through clenched teeth, "is
Prince Vegeta.  Take me to the edge of Chaos itself, before Time or
beyond Space, whichever."
<p>
The Ferryman's head snapped around, large round Saiyan-like ears
swivelled in Vegeta's direction. Even his slit eyes widened, revealing
opal-white orbs with no pupil. Again, Vegeta heard that high chirping
at the very edge of hearing.
<p>
"I cannot. Styx has no part in Chaos. I can take you to the
Helldarks. From the Helldarks ye walk to the Chaos Hells."
<p>
"Do it!" Vegeta snapped.
<p>
"And these others?"
<p>
"Kadru seeks a suitable husband--take her where she can find
one. Modgudh can speak for herself."
<p>
Modgudh chuckled. "It doesn't get boring around you, does it? I'll
follow the noble Vegeta's path for now."
<p>
The Ferryman looked from one to the other. "Good. Now, sit there and
stay out of the way. I have a boat to sail."  With that, he returned
to the steering oar and unlashed it, heaving at it until the boat came
around to a new course.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
After what seemed like days of rolling and surging up and down endless
dark waves, the black boat sailed into smoother waters.  Before long,
the black boat arrived at the mouth of a dark river.
<p>
"Styx," the Ferryman announced. "Calmer here, you can move around
now. Stay out of my way." He trimmed the main yard, and let out the
reefs in the squaresail; as the sail bellied out, catching the wind,
he swung the oar gently over and set the boat sailing up the River
Styx.
<p>
For uncounted hours they sailed up the dark river, enshrouded in
gloom.  On the left bank, pale things wailed and moaned and begged for
passage on the passing boat, but the Ferryman would not stop.
<p>
"Who are those restless spirits, and why do you leave the poor things
behind?" Kadru finally asked, her eyes filled with tears of pity.
<p>
"Don't have the fee," pronounced the Ferryman. "No one loved them
enough to bury them with coin; they did not love the one who paid the
fee for them, and they lost it."  It was the longest speech he'd made
yet.  He regarded Vegeta. "Ye were paid for, and not with Kadru's
gold."  The Ferryman fell silent, and said no more.
<p>
Vegeta, Prince of the Saiyajin, shivered, though he was not cold; he
felt, as the brush of his lover's hair against his face, the gentle
weight of the cherry blossoms Bulma laid upon his grave, countless
worlds away.

<p>
Trunks slouched at his desk, working on the drawing in the back of his
notebook. He'd long since tuned out the teacher's drone--listening to
Mr. Bara explain basic arithmetic to the rest of the dummies bored
Trunks silly; he'd read the math book all the way through in the first
week.  He dutifully did his lessons and homework, because it made Mom
happy, and since he scored 100s most of the time, Trunks didn't see
why he should have to listen to Mr. Bara tell him stuff he already
knew.
<p>
It was much more interesting to get just the right texture penciled in
for Raditz-san's hair, and the ghostly luminescence around the Ochimo
of Water. He'd switched to a green colored pencil for the latter.
<p>
Trunks stopped to admire his handiwork; he thought he'd done rather
well for a back-of-the-notebook pencil sketch. Then a hand fell on his
shoulder.
<p>
"Well, Mr. Briefs, I see you've managed to get your classes confused."
Mr. Bara glared sternly down at the purple-haired boy. "I'm teaching
<i>mathematics</i>, not art!"
<p>
Trunks quickly closed his notebook and shrank back in his seat,
cheeks flaming.
<p>
Mr. Bara frowned and held his hand out for the notebook. Trunks
reluctantly gave it to him, and watched as his teacher opened it to
the back, to his drawing.
<p>
"Hmmph! Definitely not lesson material!" He ripped the drawing out and
crumpled it up. "Boys will be boys, but in MY class, you will be a
student! Is that understood, Mr. Briefs?"
<p>
Trunks nodded dumbly, still too embarassed to speak.
<p>
"IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?"
<p>
"Yes, sir," Trunks answered in a very small voice.
<p>
After class, an angry and upset Trunks sulked in the hallway beside
his locker.  It just wasn't fair of Mr. Bara to embarass him in front
of the whole class like that! He DID do his lessons, he passed every
test with the highest scores in the class, why did Mr. Bara care if he
drew pictures when he got bored? And it had been one of his best
pictures, too.  Trunks angrily kicked the locker in front of him.
<p>
WHANNGGGG! The whole bank of hall lockers rang from the force of
Trunk's kick; the door of the locker he'd kicked crumpled up like
tinfoil around his foot.  Trunks stared dumbly at the wad of sheet
steel wrapped around his foot.
<p>
"Oops." He looked around guiltily. To the left--no one; to the
right--MR. BARA!
<p>
"Mr. Briefs! I believe we need to have a talk with the principal about
your temper..."
<p>

<p>
Sinhika hurried toward the elevator; it wouldn't do to be late
reporting to her new boss on the first day. As she hurried, she
reflected on her recent encounter with Raditz. He was the big
attractive guy that time downtown--but then she hadn't been close
enough to see details.  She'd almost lost her composure when she
realized what that brown fur "belt" was--a tail! He looked like one of
the Ghost Prince's people--that same outrageous hair, sense of raw
power, and of course, the tail--he had to be one of them!
<p>
Sinhika, she scolded herself, don't be an idiot--you came to Satan
City in the first place because the Ghost Prince came from there.  I
shouldn't be surprised to find more of his kind here. In fact, the
only surprising thing is that I haven't run across the others he
mentioned, Kakarott and Gohan. I would think that such powerful
warriors would be well known. Instead, the only well-known local
warrior seems to be that Mr. Satan character.
<p>
She suddenly wanted to see Sean's magic painting again; would she find
someone in it who looked like a close relative of Raditz, too? Sinhika
had a creepy hunch that she would. What was the significance of that
painting?  The king of the monkey people--no, what was it the Ghost
Prince called himself?--the king of the Saiyajin and his court, in
Hell. Were they really the Children of Hanuman?  Sinhika wasn't sure
she believed that--it had been a very long time since she'd met
Hanuman the Wind-childe, but she remembered him as being a very nice
furry white monkey-person who made her laugh. How could his children
be demons of Hell?
<p>
How could your kind, compassionate and righteous father have a brother
who was the Demon King, the terror of the Three Worlds, who stole
another man's wife and was slain for it? a contrary thought whispered
in the back of her mind. Good and evil are not inherited; good men may
have wicked children, and good children may have evil parents.

"TRUNKS DID WHAT??" Bulma shouted into the phone. "Yes, I'll be coming
down there right away--no, I can't. I've got an appointment in fifteen
minutes, too late to postpone it--but just as soon as I can, I'll get
down there!" Bulma slammed the phone down.
<p>
"What has gotten into that boy?" Bulma muttered as she picked up the
phone again and punched in the codes that switched it over to
comm-link mode. "The same thing that's gotten into me, I suppose." She
rested the phone on the desk for a moment, as one stray tear escaped
her eye. "Vegeta.." her empty heart ached.
<p>
"No! I will.. not.. start.. crying!" She grabbed the phone up and
punched in a certain ident code. "Raditz! Since you insist on
following me around, I will be going to Trunks' school in about half
an hour or so." Bulma slammed the phone down.
<p>
"I shouldn't have done that," she sighed. "That was rude; it isn't
poor Raditz's fault." Bulma looked at her desk, stared at the wall,
glared at the computer. "Hmmm.. well, rather than mope.." She started
browsing a certain archive of computer files--computer files that her
attack programs had copied from VirtualBlack's computer before erasing
it.
<p>
"'Goth Convergence'--oh boy, aren't we Mr. Cool!  'Tools' and
'Downloads'--predictable hacker crap. 'Interesting'--there's my Saiyan
tech manuals, you thief! 'Dreams'--what's this? Pictures?
'GameOfDemonKings', 'Wolfslayer'.. Hmmm.. doesn't sound like the kind
of hentai crap I'd expect... Let's see if I can display them..."

<p>
Raditz walked across the compound, thinking dubious thoughts about
Nezumi.  The more he thought about it, the more he doubted that
Hiregumi had put her up to spying on him. No, Raditz doubted that
Nezumi meant to spy on him at all--but if not, what was her real
reason for wanting to get close to him?  Raditz was sure she had been
sincere about that part. But why?
<p>
Raditz barged through the front door of the main Capsule Corp
building--and stopped suddenly as realization struck him. Could it be
that simple??  She wants to be close to me.. because she wants to be
close to me.  He thought back to all his 'chance' encounters with
Nezumi and her black-haired friend Lina.
<p>
I don't believe this! I am a clueless idiot! How could I have missed
such obvious signals? If a Saiyan girl had even hinted at.. I would
have.. Oh, crud.
<p>
Raditz started walking slowly toward the stairs. I just wasn't
thinking of them as people, he thought, hating himself.  Not as real
women who might be really interested in me as a real live man. So many
years of denying to my heart that anyone without power and a tail
could be people.. He clenched his fists tightly, and then let go as he
floated up the hollow stairwell to the top floor.
<p>

<p>
Sinhika knocked, and stepped into the office holding an armful of
folders. Bulma sat motionless, staring at her computer screen, her
face blank with shock. She didn't seem to notice Sinhika.
<p>
"Ms. Briefs? Um, I'm not early, am I.." Sinhika trailed off as Bulma
turned slowly to face her, that look of shock and confusion still
written on her face.
<p>
"How can this be?" the blue-haired woman asked shakily.
<p>
"How can what be?" Sinhika walked quickly over to this desk to see
what was so shocking and horrifying--
<p>
--and dropped the presentation she'd so carefully put together, now
forgotten in her own shock.
<p>
"<i>Pitaa</i>! <i>Aadhyaatmikuum Kshatriyaa</i>!"
<p>
There, in full color on the computer screen, was an extremely vivid
portrait of King Vibishana and Ghost Prince Vegeta playing chess!  And
the style--she'd seen one other painting in that vivid, dynamic
style--Sean's painting!
<p>
"What?" The shock vanished from Bulma's eyes, replaced by
suspicion. "You're the new girl--Miss Manohara? What could you
possibly know about this?"
<p>
Sinhika pulled her scattered wits together. "I.. I'm sorry,
Ms. Bulma. The portrait--it is such a vivid one of a fearsome
personage of ancient myth. The artist is very.. skilled."
<p>
"Who?"
<p>
Sinhika pointed gingerly at the black-skinned demon noble. "That is
Vibishana, the Demon King of the Rakshasas. You can tell, because he
has black skin--demons are always depicted so--and wears royal
garb. There were only two Kings of the Rakshasas in all of myth; the
first was Ravana, who had ten heads and twenty arms, and the second
was Vibishana, who has but one head and two arms, but whose eyes are
sapphire and can see all hidden things. I do not recognize the other
player from any myth, though." The orange-haired girl looked shyly at
Bulma. "Did you draw this?" Sinhika dissembled.
<p>
"No," Bulma answered, relaxing. "I found it, and was very surprised by
the skill of the artist.. and his choice of subjects," she added
mysteriously.  "Enough of this." She closed the viewer, and turned
back to Sinhika. "Down to business.."
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"Raditz. Could you come here? There's something I want your opinion
on." The request was normal enough, but Bulma's voice was tight and
strange. The big Saiyan looked at her sharply. Now what?
<p>
Bulma carefully closed and locked the door behind them, making Raditz
very edgy. It was after working hours, now, and almost everyone else
was gone for the day. What was she up to?
<p>
He found out. His own throat went tight as he looked at "Game of Demon
Kings" in its full glory on Bulma's wide-screen display.
<p>
"Vegeta," Raditz finally managed to say. "But who's the other guy? And
where in the HELL did you get this portrait?"
<p>
"Out of the personal files of the twit hacker who stole my tech
manuals off of YOUR computer--you do remember that incident, don't
you?"
<p>
Raditz rubbed his head. "Yeah."
<p>
"My newest employee--the Indian girl--managed to identify the other
player as a mythical demon named Vibishana, King of the Rakshasas. I
looked them up--they're mythical shape-changing, man-eating demons of
India.  Okay, the artist likes to paint mythical figures--but how in
the hell did Vegeta get in his picture?  And why is he dressed like
that?"
<p>
"That's.. how Vegeta appears in Hell." Raditz seemed reluctant to say
anything more.  "He's wearing the armor and cloak of a Saiyan
prince--what he IS, what he.. sees himself to be. I can't really
explain it better than that."
<p>
"As for how did Vegeta get in the picture.. Maybe I should ask the
artist." Raditz smirked evilly.  "Know where I can find him?"
<p>
"Not yet--I just have his electronic address. You and Mr. Hiregumi
might be able to find it out his real-world address from that, but
I'll bet his real-world address is somewhere in his own computer
files--which I have." Bulma smirked back.  "I'd like to hear what
Mr. VirtualBlack has to say about his paintings, myself! Take a look
at the other one."
<p>
Bulma opened another image, this one titled, "Wolfslayer".  A burning
golden giant ape and a monstrous white wolf fought across mountain
tops in a swirl of blazing gold and silver white; the moon silhouetted
them. Superimposed on the image of the ape was the ghostly face of a
man--the face of Vegeta, snarling in battle rage.
<p>
Raditz stared at it for a bit. "Our artist friend seems fond of
Vegeta, doesn't he?  But how could Vegeta be ouzaru? His tail--Bulma,
show me the first picture again!"
<p>
Bulma displayed "Game of Demon Kings" again. Raditz's finger darted
out. "Look! He has a TAIL! Funny color for a Saiyan's tail, though."
<p>
Bulma stared. "I can't believe I missed that! It's white. Maybe that's
why I missed it--all the Saiyan tails I've seen have been brown."
<p>
"They're always brown," Raditz said, still staring. "Why did he draw
Vegeta with a white tail?"
<p>
"Maybe--"
<p>
The floor trembled--at first a minor tremor like so many in the past
few days, but then it gathered in strength and violence--the floor,
the walls, the whole building heaved and tossed like a small boat in a
hurricane.
<p>
Without stopping to think, Raditz grabbed Bulma and sheltered her in
his arms, ready to fend off the worst the shuddering earth might throw
at them. Bulma screamed in protest as the walls cracked open, "But
this building is earthquake proof!"
<p>
Then the floor collapsed underneath them, and the ceiling followed
after.  Bulma screamed; Raditz's aura flared as he formed a ki shield
around them and flew upward.  Once, twice, thrice he blasted chunks of
reinforced concrete into dust; he batted lesser debris aside with one
hand and will.
<p>
It only took a second for Raditz to blast his way clear of the
collapsing building, but to Bulma it seemed like an hour of terror
before they hung suspended in the blue sky, looking down at the
spreading ruins.
<p>
Everywhere she looked, buildings swayed and fell; dust rose into the
sky. The ground heaved and cracked, splitting open into crevasses,
sliding and rising to form new hills and cliffs.
<p>
"Gods..." Bulma buried her face in Raditz's chest.
<p>
He held her silently for long minutes. "Your parents are alive."
<p>
"What? How did you--oh. You sensed them?"
<p>
"Yes, down there in the garden." Raditz nodded at the ground.
<p>
Bulma looked down. Yes, there they were, safely in the middle of the
garden, looking around. She suddenly realized that the ground was a
lot closer, that Raditz was landing them right in the garden--
<p>
"Bulma! You're okay!"
<p>
"Baby!" Mrs. Briefs hugged her daughter tightly, rare tears flowing
from her eyes. "We thought you'd been killed when the HQ building
collapsed!"
<p>
"Raditz saved my life--Trunks! Where's Trunks! He was at school!"
Bulma started to panic again.
<p>
"He's alive, too." Raditz said. His eyes were closed; he seemed to be
listening to some distant voice.  His lips curved up in the hint of a
smile as his eyes opened. Goten is fine, too, he thought to himself.

Trunks had been sitting in the principal's office writing "I will not
lose my temper and break things" for the 478th time when the quake
hit. Remembering the school's frequent earthquake drills, he started
to hide under the principal's desk with the principal--then he
remembered Nezumi.
<p>
He ran out into the secretary's office. "Miss Nezumi?"
<p>
Nezumi looked at him, somewhat startled as she sheltered in a doorway,
arms over her head to protect herself. "Young man, get under that
desk--NOW!"
<p>
"Yes, ma--YOUCH!" Trunks reflexively threw his hands up as a ceiling
beam crashed through the false ceiling, and executed a perfect Burning
Attack. Ceiling beam and the rest of the ceiling vaporized in the
incandescent brightness; blue sky reigned above.
<p>
"Wow. I guess I did learn something from all that training with
Goku-san." Trunks ran over to Nezumi as soon as the floor stopped
heaving. "Are you all right?"
<p>
"I think so." Nezumi looked at the hole in the ceiling and looked at
Trunks again.  "Did I really just see you vaporize the ceiling and the
entire second floor room above us?"  The usually giggly brown-haired
girl was wide-eyed and serious.
<p>
Trunks looked up. "Oh, man, I hope I don't get in trouble for that. I
wasn't mad or anything--I just thought the ceiling was going to crush
us!"
<p>
Nezumi couldn't help smiling at Trunks; the boy looked so worried! "I
know, and I think you were right--that beam would have smashed us
flat! Either that, or we would have been buried under the second floor
when it fell on us!" She held out a hand for Trunks, and he helped her
up. "Just don't mention it to the principal," she winked. "I don't
think he'd understand."
<p>
After checking that the principal was okay, they made their way out to
the car--only to halt in dismay. Not only was the road
unusable--broken and covered with fallen electric lines, but the car
had fallen into a chasm in the ground and been crushed.
<p>
"I guess we're not going anywhere soon," Nezumi muttered.
<p>
Trunks was wide-eyed. "What happened to everything?"
<p>
"Earthquake, Trunks--a bad one. A very bad one. This one's probably
going to make headlines around the world." Nezumi was exactly right.
<p>
Nezumi's cellphone buzzed. "Yes? Ah! He's fine, ma'am. Trunks is right
here with me--not a scratch on him. Dust, on the other hand..."
<p>
Thip! Something landed on the grass behind Nezumi, and Trunks' eyes
went wide with surprise.  Then he grinned even as she turned around,
reaching for the gun in its concealed back holster, and yelled,
"RADITZ-SAN!" as he bolted past her.
<p>
Nezumi snatched her fingers out of her jeans like she'd been caught
doing something naughty, and tried to look innocent as she faced the
big.. tall.. muscular.. handsome.. incredibly long-haired
bodyguard. As Trunks greeted Raditz, Nezumi noticed that he, too, had
plenty of plaster dust in his hair.
<p>
"Hmmm.. That car isn't going anywhere," Raditz observed. "Come here,
Nezumi."
<p>
"Uh, the last time I got close to you--"
<p>
"--I did exactly what I'm planning to do now--grab you and fly."
Raditz smirked. "I'm taking Trunks home now. You coming?"
<p>
"Just watch where you put the hands, big guy," Nezumi walked up to
Raditz, smirking back.
<p>
Raditz grinned evilly. "Okay." He grabbed Trunks with his right arm,
and grabbed Nezumi by the arm with his left hand. He rose into the
air, and just as Nezumi started to feel the strain of suspending her
entire weight from her shoulder, Raditz's TAIL wrapped around her
waist and hips in a most intimate manner, supporting her weight and
holding her close to him.
<p>
"T-Tail! You've got a tail!" she squeaked as she grabbed him around
the waist in return.
<p>
"Yep."
<p>

<p>
Sinhika landed gingerly on the roof of Sean's apartment
building. Amazingly enough, the old building was neither collapsed nor
on fire. There were a few cracks in the walls, and she doubted a
single unbroken window remained in the city, but all in all, the
place seemed pretty solid.  She hurried down to his apartment, to find
the door open, and Sean standing in the middle of his living room,
looking at the fallen and tumbled debris of his possessions.
<p>
He glanced at her and a smile flickered across his face
momentarily. "Hey, Sin. Glad to see you're okay." He nodded at the
apartment in general.  "Wouldn't you know it--half the city falls
down, and my apartment building, Cockroach Central, stands solid as a
rock! I think the roaches must have been holding the building
together." He reached down, and found a carton of cigarettes somewhere
in the mess.
<p>
"You don't smell any gas, do you?" he asked, holding his lighter at
the ready.
<p>
Sinhika sniffed the air. "No..."
<p>
"Good." Sean lit his cigarette, and soon the distinctive reek of
burning clove filled the air.
<p>
"I'm glad YOU'RE okay," Sinhika walked over to Sean, grabbed him by
the lapels of his shirt, pulled him to her face and kissed him, long
and hard.
<p>
"Whoa! What was that for?"
<p>
"Just because you're you, Sean." Sinhika winked. She peeked into the
small studio he used. "Did the painting survive? I wanted to look at
it again."
<p>
Sean stepped over some fallen books into the studio, where he picked
up the collapsed easel and painting. "No damage, but.." he trailed
off.
<p>
"But?" Sinhika looked at the painting with him.
<p>
"I have this vague memory of spilling my guts to you about my
paintings, so I guess it's all right to point out that the painting
has.. changed."
<p>
The orange-haired girl looked where the black-clad artist was
pointing. "You're right. The white-cloaked guy who was kneeling before
the king is gone, and he's been replaced by that ugly bald guy in the
heavy Chinese armor who's in a huddle with the king and that
scar-faced guy with the every-which-way-hair."
<p>
"I wouldn't call it a huddle, more of a staff conference.  A meeting
of the king with his ministers." Sean frowned, wishing Sinhika would
take his cursed painting a bit more seriously.
<p>
Sinhika pursed her lips. "Could be. Scarface there has been standing
at the king's side the whole time. Since he and the king are the only
two wearing red cloaks, I'd say Scarface there is someone very
important..."
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
While Sinhika and Sean discussed the finer points of art inside,
outside, Pomona and Melchior made their way to Sean's apartment.
<p>
"Melc, we are sooo lucky! I can't believe we left the Cafe just before
the quake hit--and the whole place collapsed!" Pomona was still a bit
shaky.
<p>
"Uh, yea!" Melchior's comment was a bit clipped; he was out of breath
from stumbling over rubble and dodging fallen electrical
lines. "Sean's probably okay--his building's still standing."
<p>
"He's the only one of us with a roof over his head, so far. Hope he
lets us crash with him."  Pomona was in better shape than Melchior.
<p>
They made their way up the lightless stairs to the dimly lit hall on
Sean's floor.
<p>
"Looking for a place to crash?" The slender man with the long black
hair and black trenchcoat stood in the middle of the hall, blocking
Pomona's way.
<p>
"Voron! What are you doing here?" Pomona snapped. "And don't tell me
you're crashing with Sean--he'd toss your sleazy ass right out the
nearest window first."
<p>
"Pomona! I'm crushed.  I just thought I'd offer you two the chance to
join with us--with my new coven. We've plenty of places to sleep, and
you'd both be very welcome."
<p>
"Oh cripe, what is it this time, Voron?" Melchior asked
sarcastically. "First you tried the Wiccans, then the Druids, then the
Scientologists.. last I heard, even the Church of Satan kicked your
sorry ass out!"
<p>
Voron held out his hand, and slowly drew into a fist. He snarled
angrily, "I WASN'T KICKED OUT! I left those bickering fools because
they had no real power! I've found the real thing, now!"
<p>
"Oh, sure, right. Voron, you and the horse you rode in on, you know
what to do!" Pomona sneered.
<p>
"I'm sorry you feel that way. Melchior?"
<p>
"Voron, you're a jerk, you've always been a jerk, and you always will
be a jerk. Does 'go away and never bother me again' mean anything to
you?" asked Melchior mildly.
<p>
Voron smiled evilly. "Actually, I'm not all that sorry you feel that
way. Caleb?"
<p>
"Huh? Who's Cal--"  Something smashed into the side of Melchior's
head, and everything went black.
<p>
Pomona spun around, and yelled as Melchior collapsed. Sean's unshaven
nextdoor neighbor stood over his falling body, a blackjack in one
hand. He smiled at Pomona, terrifying her utterly.
<p>
"Scream all you like--no one will hear you," Voron mocked. "I told you
I have <i>real</i> power now!"
<p>
Pomona responded by punching Voron in the face with a heavily
be-ringed hand. "Power this, you son-of-a-bitch!" Then she kneed him
in the groin, and Voron was out of action.
<p>
Caleb jumped on her from behind; he was as strong as a tiger. Try as
she might, she couldn't get loose from his grasp. Two other men
stepped out of Caleb's apartment, and methodically beat her senseless.
<p>
After a few minutes, Voron got back to his feet and wiped the blood
off of his cut and bruised face.  "Now, boys, these two have POWER!
Might not look like much, but Pomona here," Voron kicked her in the
ribs, "has the potential to be a first class witch. Too bad she won't
live so long.  Melchior, here, is also gifted--and he IS a witch."
<p>
Voron bent down and ripped a small necklace off Melchior's neck,
revealing the pentacle. "We'd never have been able to get the jump on
him without the ritual Keikan-Ma taught me, that hides you from all
supernatural senses." He glanced down the hall at Sean's door. "We've
got a good haul tonight, boys, but the real prey I want is behind that
door. The artist and the mystery girl--they're both very powerful and
probably don't even know it.  Keep an eye out for opportunities, and
let me know before you move! End of lecture, gentlemen; let's go."
<p>

<p>
Something howled in the distance; two more doleful voices joined,
baying at some nameless thing in the depths beyond the right bank.
<p>
"What is making that hideous racket?" Prince Vegeta asked. He leaned
against the bow, watching the Styx flow by.
<p>
"It sounds almost like Garm--if there were a pack of him." Modgudh
observed.
<p>
The Ferryman grunted. "Cerberus. Guards Tarterus." He lounged against
the sternpost, one hand resting lightly on the steering oar.
<p>
Kadru perked up. "The three-headed dog who guards the Underworld in
'<i>The Odyssey</i>' and '<i>The Twelve Labors of Hercules</i>'?"
<p>
Everyone stared at Kadru. "Where did you learn that?" demanded Vegeta.
<p>
The Naga princess looked indignant. "I'm not ignorant; I had a proper
education, you know.  I've studied all the classics, both Western and
Eastern."
<p>
"Another giant dog guardian? What is this obsession with canines? I
would think demons or soldiers would make better guards!"  Vegeta
folded his arms and sneered.
<p>
The Ferryman chuckled. "You'll see those."
<p>
The black ship rounded a bend in the river, and came out between
widening canyon walls. Above them, the Ferryman's passengers could see
a vast blueviolet dimness; ahead, a vast cliff.  The Styx flowed into
a vast cave mouth in the cliff; in it, something glowed.
<p>
"Now what?" asked Vegeta.
<p>
"The Twelve Hours of Night," rumbled the Ferryman. "Good timing. Ra is
just ahead of us."
<p>
Modgudh's fleshless face turned toward the Ferryman. "So I'm an
ignorant country girl--who is Ra and why is this good timing?"
<p>
"Sun god of Khem. Better to be behind him, and not catch up to him,
than be ahead of him, and be overtaken by him.  He makes things a bit
hot," the dark being stated laconically.
<p>
Vegeta laughed mockingly. "You people actually believe that Earth's
primary star disappears into the underworld at night?  How
ridiculous! Even children know that the planet rotates on its axis to
create day and night."
<p>
The Ferryman smiled a toothy smile.  "In the world of the living,
yes. You're not there, are you?"
<p>
Prince Vegeta scowled, and fell silent. He made his way back to the
bow, and stared out at the river, waiting.

<p>
"IIIIAAAAA!" Vegeta flung the three-headed crocodile-demon across the
barge and back into the Stygian Nile from whence it had come--minus
its heart and a few other vital organs. A back kick disposed of the
serpent man that thought it was sneaking up on him.
<p>
CHUNK! Modgudh decapitated the last of the serpent men. She'd armed
herself with a bronze khopesh and hide shield wrested from one of
their attackers, and had hacked her way through the crowd with wild
abandon.
<p>
The water boiled as the giant twenty-headed fire-breathing snake-demon
sank limply back into the river--all but one of its heads were crushed
by the Ferryman's black mace.
<p>
The Naga princess coiled around the base of the mast, a khopesh
gripped in each of her six hands.  Vegeta still wasn't sure where the
extra four arms had come from, or when, but Kadru had given a good
account of herself--there was an impressive pile of serpent-demon
corpses around the mast.
<p>
"Is that the last of this trash?" the Prince of the Saiyajin snarled.
<p>
The Ferryman looked the length of the boat, up, and around. "Looks
like."
<p>
Modgudh wiped her blade clean, and then began methodically stripping
corpses of weapons and tossing the bodies overboard. At Vegeta's
contemptous sneer, she said mildly, "You may kill godwolves with your
bare hands--I like a good blade myself.  However, I'll make do with
these brazen weed choppers."
<p>
Vegeta turned on his heel to glare at the Ferryman. "I thought you
said you had an <i>agreement</i> with the gods of the Hours!"
<p>
"The <i>gods</i>, yes. Those krjalk snakes are god-enemies. No agreement
with them," the Ferryman growled in his bass voice.  He
shrugged. "Just hit 'em a lot; they stop after a while."
<p>
Vegeta smirked. They had sailed smoothly through the First Hour, and,
after exchanging questions with the officious gatekeeper godling,
through the gates of the Second Hour.  About half way through the
Second Hour, the snake-demons attacked.
<p>
Vegeta thought it had been an amusing warm-up, and a welcome
distraction in the hereto uneventful and BORING river voyage.  He
turned to stare at Kadru. "When did YOU learn to fight?"
<p>
She glared at him, pouting indignantly as usual. "Occasionally a
maiden must defend her own virtue; it would be unwise to be totally
dependent on another." She closed her eyes modestly. "My mother taught
me how to defend myself."
<p>
Vegeta blinked.  She turns into a six-armed mowing machine--and she
considers it 'maidenly self-defense'?? What do the nagas do when they
are <i>serious</i> about fighting??
<p>
Vegeta paced the length of the ship, kicking a few corpses back into
the river. "Now what? Will they try it again?" The Saiyan prince
looked hopeful.
<p>
"Maybe. Not likely." The Ferryman slouched at the steering oar again.
<p>
"Why not? Are they that cowardly?" Vegeta asked scornfully.
<p>
"Boat's mine. I am of the Dark. Krjalk snakes are Apep's. Apep is the
Serpent of Darkness." The Ferryman shrugged. "We're not natural
enemies."
<p>
Vegeta's eyes narrowed. "So what are you--natural allies?"
<p>
"Mmph. Nope. Different darks." The dark boatman cocked his head
slightly, watching Vegeta. Yet again, Vegeta heard that strange high
chirping.  "Maybe not so different.  Sun is Apep's enemy, sun is my
enemy.  Different methods; they fight the sun, I stay away from it."
<p>
"What about this Apep?"
<p>
"Big stupid snake. Should be dead for the day by the time we get
there. If not.. could be trouble." The Ferryman shifted slightly on
the oar.
<p>
"Why? Would he attack us?" Vegeta asked eagerly.
<p>
"If he thinks my boat is the sun barge, yes. Otherwise," the boatman
shrugged, "don't know. He's stupid, but very strong."
<p>
Vegeta smirked. "Good! I hope he's strong," the dead prince said, his
eyes alight with anticipation, as he leaned against the gunwale,
watching and waiting.
<p>

<p>
"Did everyone get out?" Bulma asked worriedly, looking at the ruins of
Capsule Corps HQ.  Trunks was in his grandpa's house, having a bath
and getting cleaned up; Nezumi and Raditz stood with Bulma.
<p>
"As far as I know," she continued, "Raditz and I were the only ones
left on the top floor--it was Friday afternoon, after all."
<p>
Nezumi looked increasingly worried. "Mr. Hiregumi was still working
when I left to pick up Trunks--he was staying late to take care of
some things Kidoru was supposed to do today.  If he's still there.."
Her big brown eyes filled with tears.
<p>
"There's no one alive in there," Raditz said abruptly.
<p>
Nezumi bit her lip and looked away. "We have to make sure.."
<p>
"I'm sure," said Raditz.
<p>
"Is that really necessary?" Bulma asked archly.
<p>
"I told you once before, I don't believe in comforting lies," the big
Saiyan answered.
<p>
"You also said you knew when to keep your mouth shut, if I remember
correctly," Bulma retorted.
<p>
"This isn't the time. That rubble is loose and dangerous. No need to
go in there in a hurry and get someone killed if there's nothing under
there but corpses. Take the time to do it right.  There's enough
people dead already today." Raditz's face was impassive, devoid of
even his usual scowl.
<p>
"Maybe he left before the quake.." Nezumi tried to find one last bit
of hope.
<p>
Raditz shook his head. "No. Hiregumi-san.. is dead."
<p>
"You heartless bastard! You say that like it was nothing! Don't you
have any feelings at all?" Nezumi's tears ran freely. She turned to
Bulma "Ms. Bulma, if you will excuse me, I don't think you will need
me to drive you anywhere today anyway."
<p>
At Bulma's nod, she walked away, back straight, chin up and eyes
filled with angry tears.
<p>
Bulma whirled to face Raditz, angry words at the tip of her
tongue--and stopped. His face was still expressionless; both his hands
were held down at his side, fists clenched.
<p>
He looked at Bulma. "I felt him die; his ki faded away right after the
collapse--when I was hovering above the building with you. He was the
only one still in the building besides us."  Raditz looked away.
"Strange.. he had no power to speak of, yet I respected him. He taught
me things I never even conceived of about my own profession--and I
mean my REAL profession, not that 'Planet Trade' death squad business
of Frieza's.  He was smart, and he was tough--and I don't mean
physically--and he had the gift of being able to teach his hard-earned
experience to others--even me."
<p>
Bulma shuddered; it was just too much, on top of everything
else. "Raditz, take me inside--I can't stand to look at this anymore!
No, not my parent's house--I don't want to face them right now--my
place--if it's still standing."
<p>
It was. The small one-story Capsule houses had ridden out the quake
all over the city--the hemisphere dome was tremendously strong and not
vulnerable to the whiplash effects that toppled skyscrapers.
<p>
Her house should have been a sanctuary from the disaster outside--but
the earthquake had left its mark here, too. Bulma stared in horror at
all the little things thrown to the floor, broken or disarrayed.  She
trembled as she picked up one of her favorite pictures of Vegeta and
Trunks--the glass was cracked, the frame bent.  It was the last straw.
<p>
She threw herself at a surprised Raditz, held onto him, leaned her
head against his warm chest and cried, a storm of inner pain bursting
loose. Almost instinctively he put his arms around her and held her
while she wept.
<p>
Raditz looked down at the beautiful blue-haired woman in his arms,
finally understanding as her tears stripped away the last of the armor
from his heart. You've found my weakness, woman; I care about you.  It
isn't just duty anymore. It hasn't been that since I stepped between
you and the Opawang, and died your death.
<p>
Sometimes I think it's because you remind me of Luki--she had blue
hair, too--but she was nothing like you.  Other times, I think it
started with the strange bond you created when you took my scouter for
your own--I saw you from Hell, then. Maybe it started when you stood
with Kakarott at our first meeting, so long ago; I don't know. I just
know that I care for you, I would die again for you, and I will kill
anyone or anything that tries to hurt you.
<p>
And I cannot endure your tears.  Raditz could feel her tiring from the
force of her own sobs; he picked her up and laid her down on a couch,
and sat beside her. She curled up next him, comforted by his warmth
and strength; the big Saiyan held her and tenderly stroked her hair.
<p>
After a time, Bulma lifted her head and looked intently at Raditz's
face, as if searching for some sign. "Raditz.." She sighed, and pulled
away slightly. "I like you, but..."
<p>
"I know." His face was not quite as impassive as he intended; Bulma
could see the regret in his eyes, in the set of his mouth.
<p>
"This is--" she began again.
<p>
"--not right." He finished. "I should leave now. I meant to.. help,
but I'm only good at hurting." He stood, and Bulma rose with him.
<p>
She held his big hands in her small, delicate hands. "Raditz! You
helped more than you know." She stood on tiptoes, threw her arms
around Raditz's neck, and kissed him, much to his surprise. Before he
recovered from his split-second of shock, Bulma let go and stepped
back.
<p>
"Thank you."  Bulma smiled, wiping her tears away with one
hand. "Vegeta is my mate and my heart and half my soul," she said,
"but YOU are more than just a friend, just like your little brother. I
do love you both, but not <i>that</i> way--and you know that.  You are
right, you do need to leave, but don't go too far--and come back
soon!"
<p>
Raditz looked at her thoughtfully, and then said, with just a hint of
a smile, "I'm not going all that far!"
<p>
Bulma smiled knowingly, and just before he flew away, said, "Give
Son-kun my love, Raditz."
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Unfriendly eyes watched Raditz go. &lt;He leaves them alone, Great
Deputy!&gt; Scout informed Deputy via their mindlink. &lt;He goes to Son
Goku&gt;.
<p>
&lt;Excellent, my Scout! You know the plan; execute it!&gt; Deputy heaved
himself from the filth and toxic mud of his lair, and shook his wings
clean of encumbering sludge.
<p>
&lt;Enforcer!&gt; Deputy hunched on his powerful back legs as he waited for
the shadow demon to respond.
<p>
&lt;Master?&gt; A sleepy query; it was still daylight, and the shadow demon
was a night creature.
<p>
&lt;Your opportunity comes. Raditz has left the city, and will not
return. You have your orders; carry them out!&gt;  With a powerful leap,
Deputy surged into the air, his ponderous wings flapping lazily as he
gained altitude and speed.
<p>
It was time to deal with Raditz.

<p>
Upon a mountaintop not too many miles distant from Son Goku's humble
dwelling, a certain Namek meditated.  Something curious caught his
eye.
<p>
"What manner of creature is that, and what is its business?" Piccolo
wondered.  "Strange that I cannot sense its ki; another android?"
<p>
The green warrior rose into the air. "And over there travels a ki I do
recognize," he muttered with some distaste. "Raditz. I thought it was
safe to forget him years ago.  They must be getting sloppy in Hell, to
let him out! It makes a certain perverse sense that it would be Bulma
who wished him back."
<p>
"I think I'll keep an eye on this; it just might get interesting."

<p>
Raditz blasted through the sky toward Son Goku's house in the
mountains.  He took no notice of the natural beauty all around and
below him; his thoughts were elsewhere.
<p>
Her heart belongs to Vegeta--I could hate him for that, for meeting
her first.. only he didn't. I met her first, on that tiny island--yet
another wonderful chance thrown away by my own stupidity. Damn, damn,
DAMN!
<p>
I want her--gods, I desire her!--but it would be just plain WRONG.
Even I know that. We Saiyajin had that right, at least--stealing
another man's mate is just plain wrong. And seducing my prince's
consort.. I have no word for the depth of betrayal and evil in that!
<p>
For my sake, for her sake, I can't stay near her--but I have to! I'm
sworn to protect her! I can only hope that Kakarott is wiser than I; I
can't see a way out of this tangle.
<p>
A flash of something yellow caught Raditz's eye. Welcoming the
distraction from his own tormented thoughts, he looked--there it was!
A familiar mottled yellow and brown winged shape flying just above the
treetops--the dinosaur-demon called Sekko-Ma!
<p>
Raditz grinned fiercely as he turned and dove toward the demon. "You
picked the wrong day to find me, demon!  Hell, any day would be the
wrong day for you!" He rocketed down, battle-lust singing in his
heart.

<p>
On the Stygian Nile...
<p>
The only sound was the creak of the steering oar as the great black
boat floated down the dark waters. Her single black squaresail was
furled; no breath of wind disturbed the Fourth Hour of Night. The
Ferryman leaned but lightly against the oar; this stretch of the
Twelve Hours of Night was calm and gently flowing.
<p>
Vegeta lounged against the gunwale, affecting a air of complete
boredom while watching and listening, alert to everything around
him. Kadru and Modgudh were out of sight, stashing the junk they'd
collected from the serpent-men in the bilges for some stupid
reason. Vegeta didn't really care why, but he did appreciate that they
were out of sight and out of his hair for the time being.
<p>
"Hmmm.. interesting," the Ferryman observed. Mighty thews flexed as
the dark boatman swung the steering oar over.
<p>
Prince Vegeta dropped his air of boredom. Anything that interested the
Ferryman, interested him. "What now?"
<p>
"A new ghost. Wants a pickup. Hmmph. Probably running from those
krjalk demi-gods that barbecue sinners along this stretch."
<p>
"What is so interesting about a new ghost in the underworld? Have
people suddenly stopped dying since I left Earth?" Vegeta scowled.
<p>
"Hmmph. They stopped coming <i>here</i> millenia ago--since anyone last
followed the gods of old Khem. Egypt, you foreigners call it. Looks
noble, too."  The Ferryman bared sharp teeth and tusks in his version
of a smirk.
<p>
The black boat's prow bumped gently against the bank; the ghost
floundered awkwardly aboard. He wore tattered yellow robes and the
charred remnants of a leopardskin cape; he had the high features and
sharp nose that Prince Vegeta had seen adorning every royal scuplture
and wall painting along the Twelve Hours.  Unlike those impassive
sculptures, this face was set in a scowl, and angry frustration
flashed in his dark eyes.  Something, demon or beast-god, howled in
the darkness beyond, and the Ferryman quickly sculled his boat off the
bank, back into the current.
<p>
"Took you long enough," the ghost snarled.  "They nearly had me. Damn
them all!"
<p>
The Ferryman rumbled mildly, "Some say patience is a virtue; it serves
me well.  Some also say beggars can't be choosers; I know kindly Ra
would not have offered you a place on his barge.  You stink of evil;
you avoid the Devourer only because Anubis cannot find one improperly
laid to rest."
<p>
The ghost glared at the Ferryman, and at his only visible
passenger. The dead prince regarded him thoughtfully, arms
folded. "The good Ferryman tells me that none have come to this
underworld in over two millenia.  Who are you, and why are you here
now?"
<p>
"Only Osiris may know my True Name, and I come here after five
thousand years--I, who was a prince of Khem, Adept of Thoth, immortal,
undying, master of spirits--I am brought low by the ignoble whelps of
a bestial race." His face was terrible to see. "I know their names,
and the names of their fathers, and from the Abyss I will curse them
as only the dead can curse-- Such woe and grief will I bring on Gohan,
son of Goku; Trunks, son of Vegeta; Bulma, consort of Vegeta and
mother of Trunks; and Raditz, brother of Goku, that they will beg for
death and curse the day of their birth. I will bring upon them--"
<p>
"--Will you?  I think not!" snarled Prince Vegeta, as his hair flamed
golden. Vegeta was on him in a flash of golden light, slamming his
good hand into the ghost's breast and seizing his heart.  The Saiyan
pulled the sorceror up to his face.
<p>
The dead sorceror stared at Vegeta in astonishment and horrified
recognition. "YOU! You are the brat's dead father!"
<p>
"So you're the 'bad one' Gohan and Raditz killed!" Vegeta smirked. He
snarled suddenly, "THEN WHY CURSE MY MATE AND CHILD, YOU TRASH??" The
dead prince squeezed the sorceror's heart in his hand.
<p>
"AHHHHHH!" The ancient sorceror gasped in pain. "You damned
beast-spawn! You dare--" His anger was choked off by a moan of agony
as Vegeta gave another squeeze.
<p>
"Answer the question, filth!" Vegeta growled.
<p>
"She made the wish.. summoned that damned spirit warrior
Raditz.. wasted MY wish from the kami of the spring.. coerced the kami
into betraying ME, the disloyal wench! The child slew my fairest
Ochimo, the Ochimo of Air.." The Opawang gasped in pain as Vegeta's
grip shifted.
<p>
Prince Vegeta smirked, plainly pleased. "He did, did he? Well, he is
his father's son!"
<p>
The Opawang's face writhed with hate. "Too late for them!" He
shrieked. "Even as I was slain and dragged below, I called on the
Child of Chaos to fulfill our pact! I will be avenged; the whole world
shall be my funeral offering!"
<p>
"Oh, really?" Vegeta's voice was oddly calm; turquoise-green eyes
regarded the sorceror cooly.  The corner of his mouth turned upward,
as if he smiled at some private jest. "And why do you think Raditz or
Gohan will not destroy this 'Child of Chaos'?  They killed YOU--
'immortal' and 'undying' you called yourself, did you not?"
<p>
"Fool! Why would I make such a pact with something no stronger than
myself?  I am NOTHING compared to the Spawn of Wakboth! I gained such
power as to be worth any cost--what care I if Chaos devours the world
after I am slain?  I am done with the world, and it with me--but my
vengeance shall shake the very heavens!"
<p>
Vegeta's eyes widened with startled understanding, and still further
with rage, and he rose into the air above the ship, still carrying the
dead sorceror. "WHAT DID YOU DO, YOU BASTARD??"
<p>
The Opawang's laugh was cruel and ugly. "I opened the way to the
living world for the Child of Chaos; my price was power and vengeance!
It is bound to fulfill my death curse, do what it will with the rest
of the world!" He lowered his voice almost to a whisper, cutting with
cold contempt, "and I see the demon-god has begun well--in slaying
YOU, he brought woe and despair to your wench and your bastard brat!"
<p>
With a scream of rage, Vegeta plunged downward, still holding the
damned sorceror. At the last moment, he veered toward the shore, and
flung the Opawang down to smash into the river bank amidst a group of
lion-headed gods and naked goddesses. The sorceror hit hard, very
hard, digging a crater several feet deep.
<p>
Prince Vegeta hovered above, watching, as the naked goddesses waved
long bronze knives and descended on the stunned Opawang, hacking and
chopping him.  A cold smirk spread across the dead prince's face as
the vengeance goddesses carried the Opawang away, in chunks, to the
firepits that burned eternally along the shore.
<p>
"Now, demon, I know your reasons! Soon.. I'll have your secrets-- and
your life!" Vegeta laughed wickedly.
<p>

<p>
Raditz laughed as he snapped his fist out in a hard blow below the
creature's ribs; at last, a decent fight!
<p>
It dodged. As before, the demon moved with incredible swiftness, and
lashed out with the great gutting claw on its foot. Raditz blocked it
with a mocking laugh. He blocked the second kick.
<p>
"I know your tricks, demon! You're fast, but not strong!" Raditz
snarled. He drew one hand back; a ball of light began to form.
<p>
Scout's head snapped back; his neck frill flared. Warned by the
demon's moves, Raditz dodged, leaning his head to one side as the
demon spat its sticky green venom past his ear.
<p>
The ki ball was almost fully charged; Raditz tensed his arm--
<p>
--and something slammed him brutally in the back! He lost control of
the ki ball and it flew off to detonate harmlessly against the
ground. Raditz himself was hurled down to crater into the ground. As
he hauled himself out of the dirt, something broad whipped around from
behind and caught him just under the ribs, sending him hurtling past a
monstrous winged form and smashing through several trees.
<p>
Raditz tumbled and pulled himself out, gaining control of his flight
through the forest.  He flew up, above the treetops; his opponent was
there to meet him.
<p>
"What the??" This wasn't any dinosaur!
<p>
Huge, blatantly male gargoyle body the size of a very large house,
leathery wings, long supple tail, powerful hindlegs tipped with great
claws, long sinewy arms ending in razor-clawed hands, a head like some
monstrous horned dog with bat ears and jagged, venom-dripping teeth,
baleful red eyes--head, arms and torso covered in mud-slimed fur, bare
wings, fine scales on the hind legs and tail.. Deputy grinned at
Raditz, showing all of his teeth.
<p>
"Now," it said in a basso growl, "you die."
<p>
"Heh." Raditz sneered in contempt. He rocketed down and around--the
great demon shifted slowly to face him. Raditz smirked; the thing was
much slower than he was!  Probably weaker.. Raditz suddenly realized
with some consternation that he could not sense the demon's power. It
wasn't low--it just wasn't there! Hidden power; maybe a lot of hidden
power. He grinned again; this was going to be a good fight!
<p>
"HAAAAI!" Raditz dove in, slipped under a wing, and hammered on the
thing's side just under the ribs.  A flurry of blows, and the demon
arched its back--
<p>
WHAMM! The leading edge of the nearest wing cuffed Raditz on the side
of the head, knocking him away. He shook his head, slightly
dazed. How'd that wing move so fast?
<p>
Flapping wings behind him--Raditz dodged Scout's clumsy attack; as
usual, Scout dodged Raditz's counterpunch.
<p>
"You should have stayed away!" Raditz growled as he charged up a ki
ball in his hand again. This time, he dodged Deputy's blow to his
back--and flung the ki ball into the great demon's face.
<p>
BOOM! Deputy yowled, a harsh metal-scream sound, and shook his head
from side to side like a dog with a noseful of cayenne. His facial fur
looked singed, and it smoked.
<p>
Scout's ineffectual kicks raked Raditz's back, but his defense kept
them from doing any real damage--though he'd need a new jacket. Tiring
of the dinosaur-demon's nonsense, Raditz suddenly snapped a hand back
and grabbed the creature's right foot; his shoulder muscles tightened
as he heaved the beast over his shoulder and into Deputy's face.
<p>
Deputy batted his servant aside, and hissed. The smaller demon
blinked, and dove away, twisting and turning as it skimmed the
treetops, heading away from the fight and toward the city.
<p>
"Now it's just you and me, ugly," Raditz said, a fierce grin on his
face, and a fiercer joy in his heart. He dove at the demon, doubled
his fists, and slammed the side of the demon's hideous jaws hard
enough to snap the creature's head to one side. He followed up with an
overhand blow to the thing's head--
<p>
It laughed at him. Deputy turned his monstrous head back to face
Raditz, showing no signs of injury.
<p>
"Now it's my turn." His jaws opened wide and vomited fire at
Raditz. The Saiyan warrior's eyes went wide just before the blast of
fiery ki hit.
<p>
When the smoke cleared, Raditz was still there, hands crossed over his
face in a ki block. His clothes smoked and smouldered. "I should have
worn armor," he muttered. "A scouter might have been smart, too."
<p>
Raditz dodged the demon's razor talons, block, block, counter-strike,
strike... no good. His best blows weren't doing enough damage to this
monster. He rocketed up and away from the demon, ki beginning to glow
in his hand.
<p>
With slow flaps of his ponderous wings, Deputy rose to meet him.
<p>
"Perfect.. hold that pose just a bit longer.... HAIIIII-YA!" Raditz
hurled a brilliant white bolt of ki down into the demon's face--
<p>
--and Deputy flung up one taloned hand and batted it away. A flash of
aura--
<p>
He does have a lot of power! Raditz realized. I still can't sense it
for some reason!
<p>
--Deputy again vomited out a fiery bolt of ki. Raditz blasted back;
the two beams of ki met and splashed, a fierce battle of wills and
power.  Inch by inch, Raditz's beam smashed its way down the stream of
contending ki, pushing the demon's fire back and back.
<p>
Deputy spasmed, coughing up another, larger gout of fire that surged
up the beam, pushed back, and devoured Raditz's ki blast as it
exploded in his face. Raditz barely managed a block; the force of the
blast tossed him through the air. He barely regained control in time
to land.
<p>
His jacket was gone, blown to shreds and his jeans were torn and
tattered. Raditz pulled off the burnt rags that had once been a shirt,
uncurled his tail and switched it from side to side, then curled it
about his waist again.
<p>
"Now I'm getting angry," the long-haired Saiyan growled. He screamed
as power began to seethe around him. The ground shook, and small
pebbles and twigs rose into the air as the warrior gathered power.
<p>
"Fool." Deputy landed nearby. "I am the spawn of Cacodemon, Child of
Wakboth the Devil. You are NOTHING!"
<p>
With a harsh screech, it leaped into the air, coming down to attack
Raditz as he gathered the last of his power in. Raditz dodged the
clawed foot, smirking--but Raditz never fought Frieza or he would have
been more careful--
<p>
--of the tail! Deputy's tail whipped forward and smashed into the side
of Raditz's head, twisting it around with neck-popping force. Raditz
was flung back and away by the blow, crashing to earth like some
discarded rag doll flung from the window of a passing car.
<p>
The Saiyan warrior staggered slowly to his feet; stabbing pain in his
neck told of damage done. Probably cracked a few vertebrae, he
thought. He spat out blood and a broken tooth, but carefully refrained
from shaking his head to clear it of the confusion and blurriness.
<p>
Deputy landed behind him and lashed out with glistening razor-sharp
talons. Raditz screamed as the talons raked his back; an acidic slime
glistened wet on the demon's talons, a slime that entered the talon
wounds and ate at his flesh, blistering and dissolving it before being
diluted and washed away by Raditz's flowing blood.
<p>
Great chunks of black hair fell to the ground, sliced away by the
demon's talons. Raditz tried to dodge before the next blow hit, but
the demon's damned tail swept his legs out from under him. He fell
face down, and rolled quickly over, just in time to avoid the demon's
clawed hind foot slashing down.
<p>
He rolled again, and grabbed the monster's tail. Raditz smirked as the
demon arched his tail and snapped him off, high into the air--it was
exactly what he wanted! He gathered ki; energy crackled and glowed in
both hands.
<p>
Deputy flapped up towards him again, red eyes glowing. "Come on, you
bastard.." Raditz muttered to himself. "Hurry it up!" The big Saiyan
felt the warm blood still running down his back from the festering
talon wounds; he was already starting to weaken. "I was saving this
one for my next spar with Kakarott--your luck to get to see it first!"
He grinned as the energy built up in each hand.
<p>
Then Raditz saw what he'd been watching for: the demon's neck muscles
bunching, getting ready to vomit out fire again.
<p>
"MAN-KI-BATSU!" Raditz brought both hands together in front of him--a
brilliant white flash, and a tremendous beam of white ki edged with
incandescent purple slammed down into the demon's face, catching
Deputy in his open jaws. The demon's own fire exploded in his face,
and the great demon was flung back and down as Raditz's beam blasted
through its mouth and out the back of its neck, burning the flesh from
its skull in its searing passage.
<p>
Raditz landed gently, chest heaving with the exertion. Across the newly
made clearing, the fallen demon sprawled atop the trees knocked down
in his crash.  Raditz's neck hurt, and by sheer will he shut out the
screaming agony of his back.  The breeze was cool on his bare, blood-
and dirt-streaked chest.
<p>
"I got you. It took everything I've got, but I got you, you son of a
bitch!" Raditz smirked--
<p>
--and Deputy got up.
<p>
Raditz's eyes went wide; the demon's terrible neck wound was closing
before his eyes; the half-charred skull rippled as flesh crawled
across it, regenerating.
<p>
"Oh, crud. A regenerator... and I've got nothing left."

<p>
Modgudh and Kadru were already back on deck when Vegeta dropped
lightly on to the deck just aft of the mainmast. The Ferryman looked
around, sweeping his muzzle from side to side, making that high
chirping sound that only Vegeta's ears could hear. He then looked at
Vegeta steadily.
<p>
"What do you want?" the Saiyan prince snapped.
<p>
"You should not have done that," the Ferryman rumbled.
<p>
Vegeta's eyes widened, and he sneered, "Too bad! That damned
sorceror--"
<p>
"Not him. You--turning into a sun spirit. There will be trouble," the
Ferryman growled.
<p>
"Huh? What happened?" asked Kadru, puzzled.
<p>
"Of course--I go into the bilge for a few minutes, and something
interesting happens." Modgudh laughed. "At least there's more fun to
come, if our gloomy captain is correct."
<p>
Vegeta smirked, and looked sidelong at the Ferryman. "So.. you think
the snake will mistake ME for the sun god, and this boat for the solar
barge? That's a very stupid snake."
<p>
"Sun god takes the same route, same time, every night. Snake still
hasn't pulled off a good ambush."
<p>
"That's a very stupid snake."

"Mama?" Little Goten looked out the window while his mother Chi-chi
cooked soup on the old wooden stove in the corner. She didn't use it
very often; only times like this, when earthquakes or typhoons knocked
out the electricity. Living up in the mountains far from nosy
neighbors had many advantages, but one disadvantage was that the Son
household was dead last on the utility company's list for getting
power turned back on.  Chichi was used to getting along without
electricity for days or weeks at a time. Losing phone service,
however, really annoyed her.
<p>
"Yes, honey?" Chi-chi replied absently. She tasted the soup; yes, it
definitely needed more leeks. Gohan liked leeks, and he'd be hungry
when he got home from school.
<p>
"How far are those mountains? Can I walk there?"  Goten was worried
about something.
<p>
Goten was very proud of being three, now, and tried hard to talk like
the grown-ups--or at least like Trunks! Goten adored the older boy,
and followed him everywhere when he and Raditz visited.  He could
hardly wait to start training with Trunks!
<p>
Chi-chi washed some more leeks and chopped the roots off. "They're
several miles away, honey--too far for a little boy to walk. If you
want to see them, wait until your Daddy gets home, and he'll take you
on Kintouen."
<p>
"I need to go now! N'uncle Raditz is hurt," Goten said carefully,
looking more worried. "I think he's fighting something bad."
<p>
Chi-chi froze and looked hard at Goten. "You aren't going anywhere,
young man! If Raditz is getting hurt fighting something, it is far too
dangerous for my baby boy! We'll tell your father when he gets home,
and he'll take care of it."
<p>
Goten pouted, but said nothing. He stood at the window, trying to
watch events far beyond his vision.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz crashed hard into the ground, flung by Deputy's lashing
tail. The pain in his neck was worse, and his right arm was numb from
the elbow on down. Blood trickled out of his nose and the corners of
his mouth. Above the clearing, the waxing gibbous moon on the horizon
mocked him, so near to full, yet not full.
<p>
The great demon toyed with him, leaping into the air and coming down
with hindclaws extended, just slowly enough for Raditz to dodge out of
the way--then he kicked Raditz across the clearing, watching as the
saiyan warrior doubled up, coughing blood. Just as Raditz started to
get to his feet, Deputy knocked him down, slashing across his chest
with acid-slimed talons.
<p>
The demon leaped into the air; this time Raditz didn't have the
strength left to dodge, and could only watch numbly as the great
hindclaws slammed down on his body.  The saiyan was mildly surprised;
it wasn't a killing blow--the great demon pinned him to the ground,
its claws wrapped around his torso.
<p>
Deputy bent over and grinned at his prey, pinned beneath his claws
like a mouse beneath a cat's paw. The demon licked his long barbed
tongue against his teeth and tittered mockingly. Then he lashed out
with his poisoned tongue and probed the bleeding gashes on Raditz's
chest, lapping up the fresh blood and whatever bits of flesh his
barbed tongue hooked.
<p>
Raditz convulsed with fresh agony. "Damn you!"
<p>
"No," giggled Deputy, pausing in its blood-tasting. "Damned are you."
It squeezed Raditz's chest in its massive claws; there was a dull
crack and a brief cry of pain as the first rib snapped. "Listen."
<p>
"Why should I?" gasped Raditz, fury and hate in his eyes.
<p>
"You must suffer and despair before you die," Deputy hissed. "Do you
know what I am going to do?" It squeezed his ribs again, snapping
another one.
<p>
"Kill me?--I figured that part out already." Something about imminent
death brought back Raditz's natural sarcasm. "What you're going to do
is die when Kakarott catches up with you. Heh."
<p>
The demon giggled again. "Son Goku will not be able to find me before
he has much bigger concerns!" The demon leaned closer,
grinning. "Taste despair at your own failure--dead, you will not stop
me from taking the woman Bulma and the child Trunks. Dead, you will
not stop my followers from taking the child Goten. Dead, you will not
aid your brother when Cacodemon arises to destroy him and the youth
Gohan!  Dead, your soul will join Vegeta's, devoured to feed
Cacodemon's power--your own power used against your brother and
nephew! Is that not sweet?"
<p>
Vegeta's soul, destroyed?? That cannot be! I met him in Hell! The
demon lies! Raditz's eyes widened in fury, and he fought to pull
himself out from under Deputy's claws in spite of his agony.
<p>
Deputy growled; something was wrong. The prey should be paralysed with
guilt and despair, not fighting back in anger! "Fool. You cannot
escape me." It tightened its grip, grinning as it felt two ribs snap
simultaneously.
<p>
"Listen to what I will do with the woman Bulma, now that you will soon
be dead and helpless to protect her. Imagine also that her child
Trunks will witness, and suffer the same fate--and the child Goten
will go to feed the appetites of my demons." Then Deputy giggled, and
told Raditz in obscene and horrific detail how he and his broo would
torment and destroy the beautiful blue-haired woman and her child.
<p>
Raditz was screaming with rage and despair long before Deputy
finished.
<p>

<p>
"MAMA!" Tears started from Goten's eyes; he was frantic. "Nunk Rats is
hurt very bad, we HAVE to go help him! PLEASE!"
<p>
Chi-chi looked at her son; in his panic, he'd forgotten all his
careful grown-up speech and grabbed on to her, bawling hysterically.
<p>
"I'll call your father; maybe he's close enough to hear." She said,
trying to calm her hysterical son. Chi-chi stepped outside.
<p>
"GOKU! GOKU, COME HOME! GOKU! ANSWER ME!" she yelled at the top of her
lungs.  No answer; he was too far away.
<p>
Goten followed her outside. "DADDY!" He looked at his mother. "Mama!
Can't you go?  PLEASE, find Daddy! Nunk Rats won't be fun anymore
soon."
<p>
Chi-chi nodded grimly. "Wait here while I take care of things." She
went inside, banked the fire, picked up a Dragunov heavy sniper rifle,
loaded it, and towed Goten with her to the hangar.  It only took her a
few minutes to fire up the stubby little canard-nosed ground-effect
plane, and they were off, searching for Goku.

<p>
Piccolo looked down to where Deputy was tormenting the helpless
Raditz. He snarled, baring one fang; the Namek's keen ears had picked
up every detail of the great demon's hideous plans.
<p>
"This has gotten a bit too interesting," the turbaned green warrior
growled to himself. "I don't give a damn what happens to that wretched
Saiyan, but..."  He plunged down.
<p>
Deputy's massive head snapped up as the white-cloaked alien warrior
appeared before him. Its eyes narrowed; the demon could sense some
power here, and suspected more that was hidden. "Interloper! This is
no concern of yours!"
<p>
"Don't be so sure about that. Your plans are a major concern of mine,"
the Namek stated calmly.  "You're done with Raditz; face me now!"
<p>
I can't sense the demon's power, but I have watched him fight
Raditz--unless he was holding back the greater part of his power, he's
a lot weaker than I. Piccolo slid into fighting stance, flexing his
muscles.
<p>
Deputy eyed him warily. &lt;SCOUT!&gt;
<p>
&lt;Deputy?&gt;
<p>
&lt;You did not tell me of a green alien warrior, wearing purple, a white
turban, and a white cloak. Tell me of him now, my loyal Scout!&gt;
<p>
&lt;Great Deputy! I do not know of this creature--unless he is the entity
called Piccolo, of whom the youth Gohan spoke on occasion. I know
nothing of him.&gt;
<p>
&lt;Useless creature! Go, assist Enforcer in his plans; perhaps you will
be more useful to him!&gt;
<p>
Deputy cocked his head from one side to the other, looking Piccolo
over from several angles. The alien had probably seen him fight, and
he was too confident for Deputy's liking. "You are Piccolo. You are
not a Saiyan."
<p>
"Well, I see news of me has travelled far. Perceptive, aren't you?
Now, what are you going to do?"
<p>
"Leave." Deputy flapped his massive pinions and rose into the air,
carrying Raditz's limp body in his huge taloned foot. "You are
correct; I am done with Raditz."
<p>
Deputy gave Raditz a final squeeze. caving in his remaining ribs, and
snap-kicked, flinging the body into Piccolo's face with considerable
force. Instinctively, Piccolo tried to catch the limp form of Raditz;
as he did so, Deputy rolled and flitted away with deceptive speed,
diving into the irregular valleys and hills.
<p>
By the time Piccolo steadied himself, Deputy had vanished into the
forested valleys. Piccolo cursed; he was unable to detect the demon,
and with no others to assist him in search, there was no way he could
find the monster if it was the least bit intelligent--and it had
proven itself to be no fool.
<p>
"Gone." Piccolo glared at the limp body gripped in his right arm; long
hair dangled down. "Damn you, Raditz! Even dead, you're a pain in the
ass."
<p>
A faint gasp from the seeming corpse. "Not.. quite.. dead.." Raditz's
body shuddered; he didn't have the strength to laugh aloud.
"Soon... Demon.. poisoned me... Happy now?"  A trace of his
characteristic sarcasm returned.
<p>
"Great. I think I'll let Son Goku deal with your soon-to-be corpse."
Piccolo laughed unpleasantly. "It'd be just my bad luck if you lived
long enough for someone to get some senzu into you." The green warrior
flew toward Goku's house, still carrying Raditz under one arm.
<p>
"Yeah.. I.. like.. you.. too." Raditz's pained whisper was only
audible to the keen ears of the Namek.
<p>
"Do all Saiyans share your delight in talking non-stop when you're
dying?"
<p>
"Can't.. fight. Might.. as well.. talk... Won't.. make me..  any..
deader...  Heh."
<p>
"The last time we met, it made you dead sooner."
<p>
"Not.. by.. much... Heh."  Raditz's body shuddered.  "Listen..  you..
heard..  the demon...  You..  Kak.. arott..  stop it... Please.." The
Saiyan fell silent.
<p>
"Raditz?" There was no answer. "Just my luck. Now where's Son
Goku--there! Flying this way, fast."
<p>
Two shooting stars blazed through the evening sky, just south of the
frozen full-moon on the horizon. They blazed larger and larger until
Piccolo could perceive two figures in the blazing auras--then they
came to halt in mid-air before him -- Goku and Gohan.
<p>
Goku looked quizzically at Piccolo. "What happened? Did you and
Raditz--"
<p>
"No, Son Goku. Two demons attacked Raditz, one large and one
small.  The large one did all the damage; your brother is badly
injured and will die if not healed soon."
<p>
"Wh-What happened to the demon?" Gohan asked, wide-eyed.
<p>
"I interfered, and it ran away from me." Piccolo did not seem willing
to talk further.
<p>
Goku took his wounded brother from Piccolo. "Thank you for saving
Raditz, Piccolo. I know you don't like him, but he is my brother."
<p>
"What are you going to do?" Piccolo asked.
<p>
"Take him home, and get some senzu." Goku looked faintly surprised at
Piccolo's question.
<p>
"After you do, I need to talk to you--the demon is after Bulma, Trunks
and Goten. There isn't time for more than that now," answered the
Namek.
<p>
Goku nodded, and blazed into the distance until he was just a shooting
star in the sky again. Gohan stayed to talk to Piccolo.
<p>
"There's something you don't want me to know, isn't there?"  Gohan
sounded disappointed.
<p>
"There are some things I don't want ANYONE to know until I've talked
it over with Goku," Piccolo replied. "Even he doesn't need to know all
the details. Some details should never be known by anyone," he
concluded, anger on his face. "Keep an eye on your little brother;
tell your father I'm going to check on Bulma and Trunks."

&lt;Scout! Enforcer! Prepare our followers--I will be initiating them
on the next night!&gt; Deputy advised the sub-demons. &lt;All is in readiness?&gt;
<p>
&lt;Yes, Master&gt; answered Enforcer. &lt;Already my sorceror goes about his
task. He is the best of the lot; bestow your mark and favor on him.&gt;
<p>
&lt;If he accomplishes this task, he will have great favor indeed!&gt;
Deputy was pleased; all was according to plan.
<p>
&lt;Great Deputy! I await the opportunity,&gt; hailed Scout.
<p>
&lt;See that you do not miss it when it appears!&gt; snarled Deputy,
displeased with Scout on general principles.
<p>
&lt;Yes, Great Deputy!&gt;

"You see, Oshimu, your lackwitted compatriot did do one thing useful,"
Voron noted as he held up a plastic card to the light.
<p>
"What's that?" the burly thug in the black commando-style shirt and
fatigues asked.
<p>
"He grabbed a mid-level in the security department--which means WE
have all his security passes, keys, and IDs. Keys to the kingdom, my
lad, keys to the kingdom."  Voron laughed unpleasantly, and pulled the
plastic card through the electronic lock with a flourish.
<p>
With a buzz and a click, it opened, admitting Voron's team to the
ruins of the Capsule Corp compound. The team spread out, each going to
their assigned position; Oshimu stayed close to Voron. Both carried
air rifles and air pistols of unusual design.
<p>
Voron concentrated a bit, then smiled. "Good. Whoever's in charge of
security is either inexperienced, or short-handed--they're guarding
the attractive areas for looters instead of securing the
perimeter. This is going to be easy, gentlemen--but do stay alert!"
<p>
It <i>was</i> easy--Voron simply walked up to the front door, waited while
Oshimu turned off the alarm and oiled the lock, and turned his stolen
master key in the lock.
<p>
PFFT! PFFT! One heavy dart from the rifle for the child, one small
dart from the pistol for the woman and it was done. Bulma and Trunks
were in the hands of the enemy.

<p>
Goku dashed frantically around the house, looking in jars and
boxes--and driving Chi-chi nuts.
<p>
"Goku! Just tell me what you are looking for!" She picked up yet
another bag he'd tossed down from the shelf.
<p>
"Senzu! There's got to be some around here; I know I had at least one
left!" Goku's usually sunny face was clouded with worry.
<p>
"You mean the one that WAS in this box?" Chi-chi asked, holding out a
small wooden puzzle box, open and empty. "I gave it to Gohan for the
burns he got fighting that evil sorceror. You're just going to have to
get more from Karin--or take Raditz to a hospital."
<p>
BANG! Gohan rushed in the front door, letting it fall shut behind
him. "Dad, Piccolo said--"
<p>
"GOHAN!" Chi-chi put her hands on her hips, furious. "Is that how I
brought you up?  Is that how I taught you to enter the house?"
<p>
"I'm sorry, mom.. I didn't mean to let the door slam," Gohan said
meekly. "Dad, it won't do any good to take Raditz to a
hospital--they're all wrecked, and the ones that aren't, are full."
Gohan said somberly.
<p>
"What?" Goku looked surprised. "What happened?"
<p>
"That earthquake.. you felt it, it was really, really bad in the
city. That's why I was late getting home from school, mom--the bus was
stranded, and I was taking the other kids home so their parents
wouldn't worry about them."
<p>
"Oh, Gohan!" Chi-chi hugged her eldest son. "I'm proud of you!" Goku
beamed, also pleased with his son.
<p>
"I'm going to Karin Tower. Take care of my brother, Chi-chi; I'll be
back as soon as I can."  Goku put two fingers to his forehead,
concentrated for a second, and was gone in a flash.
<p>
Chi-chi stepped into the darkened bedroom where Raditz lay shivering.
Goten crouched beside the bed, looking forlorn; he refused to leave
his uncle's side, and Chi-chi hadn't the heart to drag him away. In
her heart, she doubted that Raditz would live to the next
sunrise--unless Goku returned very soon with senzu.
<p>
She and Goku had cleaned and bandaged the terrible gashes on Raditz's
back and chest and taped up his broken ribs. Those were bad, but they
weren't bad enough to kill Goku's long-haired brother.  Raditz was
dying of the demon's poison.
<p>
The long-haired Saiyan drifted in and out of agonized consciousness,
alternately sweating and shivering. She didn't need to touch him to
feel the heat from the fever ravaging him, nor did Chi-chi need a
medical degree to know that his sudden and extreme sensitivity to
light, and the red bruises appearing all over his body were bad signs.
<p>
"Hurry back, Goku," Chi-chi whispered.
<p>

<p>
Piccolo hovered above the damaged Capsule Corp compound. Where would
Bulma and Trunks be staying in all this mess? He couldn't sense them
anywhere-- which wasn't too surprising where Bulma was concerned, her
ki was very weak, but he had expected to sense Trunks. Perhaps the boy
had a very low ki when he was sleeping.
<p>
Over there.. Dr. and Mrs. Briefs house. He could sense their weak
kis. A sense of forboding filled Piccolo--something was wrong. Finally
he touched down in front of the small Capsule house that Bulma had
shared with Vegeta. The green warrior touched the door; it slid open.
<p>
"What?" he muttered. "It shouldn't be unlocked!" Piccolo listened;
nothing.  He stepped inside.
<p>
It was dark; the Namek formed a small ki ball to light the way. Some
of the disarray from the earthquake had been straightened up, things
picked up and put away, but not all of it. Still no one in sight.
Quickly, Piccolo checked the rest of the small house, feeling
uncomfortably like an intruder in his rival's house.
<p>
No one here--but two beds were still warm. Someone had slept here;
Piccolo plucked a long blue hair from a pillow. "They were here... No
signs of a struggle."  The light brightened at Piccolo's command; he
finally saw the muddy footprints tracked across Bulma's otherwise
pristine rugs.
<p>
He set his foot against one of the prints; the mystery footprint was
larger. "Not Bulma or Trunks." The Namek's face was grim; he followed
the trail back to Trunk's room.  As he bent to study the prints, a
small object under the bed caught his eye.
<p>
Piccollo reached out and picked it up. "Tranquilizer dart. They've
been kidnapped by someone who knew not to let Trunks have a chance to
fight back."  His fist tightened, crushing the heavy dart. "I'm too
late."
<p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Karin-sama, you don't have any senzu??" Goku danced
from one foot to the other, panicking. "My brother will DIE if we
can't heal him!"
<p>
"Now, now, Goku, calm down. I said I didn't have any ripe right
NOW. There's a nice crop that's almost ripe; it just needs a few more
hours of sunlight." The ancient enchanted white cat shuffled from one
bush to the next, inspecting the beans. "You can have some tomorrow
morning."
<p>
"Tomorrow morning?? Oh, no!" Goku's eyes were huge. "I don't think
Raditz will live that long!"
<p>
Karin shook his white-furred head. "I'm sorry, Goku, but you know that
unripe beans are no good. I can't make the sun come up any faster."
<p>
Goku stared at Karin.  "Make the sun come up faster?" he said, a
strange look on his face.  "No, you can't." Sudden determination
gripped him. "But I can!" He clenched his fist, and started to
concentrate, the veins on his temples standing out. Energy started to
gather around his hand.  "Close your eyes, Karin!"
<p>
Karin shield his eyes at Goku's warning--just in time. The ball of
energy in Goku's hand blazed with a blinding light; then Goku threw it
into the sky above, where it swelled and blazed down like the sun.
<p>
"Goku! You created a small sun! You're such a wild man, I never know
what you're going to do next!" Karin grinned as much as a cat ever
grins.
<p>
"When I fought Vegeta, back when he first came to Earth, he created a
small moon so he could change into a giant ape," Goku mused. "I
remembered how he did it, and just changed the light to be like
sunlight, instead of moonlight."
<p>
Karin held out a forepaw. "Hmmm.. looks like sunlight, feels warm as
sunlight--it might work. We'll know in an hour or two. Join me for
tea, Goku, and we'll watch the beans ripen."
<p>

"It was wise of you to bring your concern to me, O King," Dende, Kami
of Earth, said to King Vibishana. The Rakshasa King stood near the
rail of Kami's Lookout, looking down with deepseeing sapphire
eyes. Dende watched him.
<p>
"Am I wise?  It was Prince Vegeta who was right, and I who was wrong
about the demon. It is as he said--a threat to all that lives;
destruction incarnate." Vibishana the Good Demon wrapped his red
velvet cloak about himself, brooding.
<p>
"You are wise enough to admit your mistake, and seek advice," Dende
answered, smiling. "I wish that all people had so much wisdom!" The
young god turned somber again. "This monster has hidden itself from
even my sight--without your help I would have known nothing of it
until it rose in power. I will do what needs be done, but--" he
sighed.
<p>
"--they will pay a heavy price--or so you fear," King Vibishana
observed.
<p>
Dende nodded. "There are limits to my powers, and to what I may do--
and that must be so, or I would be a greater agent of destruction than
even this monster of Chaos."
<p>
Ebon lips curved in a hard smile. "So, too, have I limits--but my
limits are different from yours, O Indra-Dende, as are my powers."
Demon King Vibishana bowed to Dende. "With your leave, I will return
to my kingdom now, and prepare to fulfill a promise I made to a
prince..."
<p>
"Do what you must, and do it well, O King."
<p>
"I shall indeed."

<p>
Far below, in ravaged Satan City, the daughter of the Rakshasa King
looked out over the battered city. Sinhika turned her head to look at
the man beside her.
<p>
"Sean, I don't think Pomona and Melc are going to show. They might
have gotten caught in the quake, or gotten stuck or something."
<p>
Sean swiped his black hair back out of his eyes, and lit another
cigarette. "Why don't you just say what you mean--they could have
gotten killed dead, or maybe they're just lying somewhere bleeding to
death!" He was tired, too tired to put any anger into his voice.
<p>
"Fine! I'll go look for them, and I'll see if I can find any
groceries. You, stay put in case they--or anyone else--show up. It's
YOUR apartment, not mine--I'd have a hard time explaining what I was
doing rooting through your stuff if the cops or the militia show up."
<p>
"I'm too tired to argue any more. Look, just be careful, okay? Don't
go and get mugged by looters or anything like that." Sean tried not to
think about what a crazy thing Sinhika was doing, going out in the
shattered city after dark, but he'd given up trying to argue her out
of it. Arguing with her when her mind was made up had proved to be
like arguing with a brick wall--he could yell, threaten, scream all
evening, and at the end of it Sinhika still did exactly what she
wanted to do.  He sighed.
<p>
And don't ever mention to her the possibility that a woman might need
to be protected by a man from whatever dangers lurked in the
city--she'd gone ballistic at the merest hint of the idea! Sean took a
long drag on his cigarette. He still couldn't figure out how
suggesting that he might be better able to deal with hypothetical "bad
guys" in the dark equated to 'being so afraid of an independent woman
that he wanted to put her back in purdah and veil', but he wouldn't
make that mistake again.
<p>
"I'll be fine, Sean," Sinhika answered through gritted teeth as she
headed out the door.
<p>
"Yea, sure." He frowned as the door swung shut behind her, not
noticing that Sinhika went upstairs, toward the roof, instead of
downstairs to the street.
<p>
His nextdoor neighbor Caleb didn't notice that fine point of fact
either; he merely noted that the girl had left--Sean would be all
alone in the apartment. He smirked to himself. Time to let the boss
know, Caleb thought as he punched a number into his cell phone.

<p>
For Prince Vegeta, sitting still and watching the river flow by was
the hardest part, as always. He craved action--sudden violence, and
the fury of battle--but now was not the time.  Vengeance would be his,
but only if Vegeta used all of his patience and cunning. His enemy had
a weakness; Vegeta merely had to find it. The Saiyan prince remembered
well Vibishana's thoughts on the matter, when in his pessimism Vegeta
had pronounced the demon unkillable.
<p>
The Rakshasa King had looked at Prince Vegeta with deep-seeing
sapphire eyes. "I reject the thing as impossible. Unslayable Ravana
was careless, and slain in the end by a human--and it was Brahma
himself who granted my brother invulnerability and power. What is this
demon? Shall I deem its power greater than the Creator's and the
Preserver's?  I think not. There will be a weakness or a matter of
carelessness, do not doubt that."
<p>
You <i>were</i> careless, demon. Or, rather, you <i>will be</i> careless! I
think I understand what you did, and you were sloppy, Cacodemon! You
made a mistake--and if you made one mistake, you will make a second
mistake sooner or later--and I will have you!
<p>
Vegeta smiled coldly to himself--then grabbed the gunwale abruptly as
the boat rocked under his feet.  "What the--?  Ferryman! I see no
rapids--have you gotten careless at the oar?"
<p>
The dark Ferryman looked steadily over his shoulder at the huge wake
trailing the ship, the wake of some huge submerged thing closing
rapidly on the boat. "I warn---"
<p>
The deck heaved wildly as the small black ship was lifted high into
the air on the back of a glistening, black, scaly back that arched
suddenly out of the water. Vegeta was catapulted into the air in a
high arc that would have dropped him into the seething river, had he
not gained control and hovered high above the writhing coils of
glistening darkness.  He noted that somehow, Modgudh and Kadru managed
to hang on to the bucking, dancing craft, and the Ferryman still
gripped the steering oar, as unbothered by the wild dance as if his
feet were glued to the deck.
<p>
The great coil rolled, and the boat slid off that monstrous back, to
splash broadside into the water.  Apep rose from the depths of the
Stygian Nile, titanic jaws agape. Higher and higher he rose, until the
great snake's dull black eyes looked down on Vegeta from a hundred
yards above.
<p>
The Night Serpent's jaws gaped wide enough to swallow two of the
Ferryman's boat; dull black cat-eyes stared down, always focussed on
Prince Vegeta. Rows of backward-slanting teeth gleamed white in its
jaws.
<p>
Suddenly, it struck!  It plunged down like a runaway locomotive
sheathed in coal-black glistening scales, irresistable and
unstoppable.
<p>
A sudden burst of speed, and Prince Vegeta dodged the monster's gaping
maw--it was slower than he. Barely slower; titanic jaws snapped shut
mere feet from Vegeta's toes.
<p>
The Saiyan prince smirked, and plunged down, his crest of black hair
nodding in the breeze of his own slipstream.  Vegeta slammed into the
broad top of the snake's head--and rebounded with a brief gasp of
pain.  That thing was tougher than rock or steel! It was more than
just a large snake--Vegeta's blow would have crushed and pierced the
skull of any defenseless mortal animal.
<p>
Apep turned his head to watch Vegeta again, and reared back, preparing
to strike again.  Great cat-pupils dilated, and contracted hastily as
crackling golden energy surrounded Vegeta, and his hair turned to
flaming gold once again.
<p>
The Night Serpent hissed in rage and hate, and struck again; again
Vegeta dodged. Prince Vegeta looked down at the snake from just above
its right eye, and held out his hand.
<p>
"Burning Attack!" A fiery fan of ki spread from Vegeta's hand to
envelope the snake's face; just before it struck, Vegeta saw the
snake's eye slam shut. The ki blast struck the glistening black
scales, and sunk into them without a trace.  The scales glistened a
bit more brightly, and Apep opened his eye again.
<p>
"<i>Kuso</i>!" The dead prince snarled, and snapped off a tight blast at
that immense eye staring him in the face.  Caught by surprise, Apep
did not close his eye in time.
<p>
The blast seared and burnt the supernal snake's eye; Apep's head
snapped back and he bellowed in pain, writhing and thrashing the
length of the Seventh Hour. Caught by the lashing tail, the black boat
was hurled out of the water and beached high on the haunted shore; the
mast snapped off and hull planks smashed in.
<p>
Maddened with the pain of his blinded eye, Apep snapped repeatedly at
Vegeta, missing every time, but forcing the Saiyan prince to ever
retreat, not attack.
<p>
"Enough of this!" Up and up he flew, the great dark serpent pursuing
after. At last he turned; the veins stood out from his forehead, and
the corona of energy around Vegeta's body crackled and sparked. He put
out one hand toward the demonic snake, then braced the other,
paralyzed hand against it.
<p>
"HAI-YAAAAAAAAAAAA!" Vegeta screamed as he sent a blazing white column
of ki energy slamming down into the snake's gaping maw! Apep recoiled
and plunged down, down into the river, smoke trailing from his
half-closed jaws.
<p>
Prince Vegeta hovered just above the roiling water, watching for some
sign of the Night Serpent. "You can't hide that easily!" he shouted,
holding his arms out straight to either side, right palm out, left
hand still limp. Below him, the water swirled and drained away, as if
pressed down by a tremendous wind.  Finally the water parted all the
way to the river's muddy bed, full of dead bones, shattered armor and
broken swords.  The water retreated, an ever-widening encircling wall
around Vegeta as his will beat upon it.
<p>
The water retreated--until stopped by an encircling wall of scaly
darkness. Apep brooded in the bed of the river, and was not
pleased. One eyesocket was empty, burnt white as ash, and flesh hung
in burnt strips from the titanic snake's mouth. Black scales glowed
with a faint light. The great head swung around, and hissed at Vegeta.
<p>
Even as the snake gathered itself to strike, the dead prince
struck. With all his Super-Saiyan fury and strength, Vegeta darted
down and smashed the monstrous snake at the base of its skull.
<p>
CRUNCH! The sheer force of the blow numbed Vegeta's arm to the
shoulders; spray and mud were thrown up in a blinding sheet from one
bank of the Stygian Nile to the other.  The concussion of the blow
rang from wall to wall of the Seventh Hour, cracking stone that had
stood unmarred since before the Pyramids were raised.
<p>
"<i>CHIKUSHO</i>! What does it take to kill you?" Vegeta stared, appalled,
as the spray settled. Apep reared back, burnt mouth agape; where
Vegeta had struck, one scale of countless myriads was cracked across.

<p>
"Impossible!" snarled Vegeta. "That thing's sheer size..." he trailed
off, a smirk on his face as he stared at the monstrous black
snake. "Size. Oh yes." The Prince of the Saiyajin laughed wickedly as
he uncurled his tail and switched it from side to side.
<p>
He rose high into the air, a glowing ball of light forming in his
right hand. The great serpent rose below him, mouth barely open. The
huge creature seemed slow, but his onslaught was as irresistible as a
runaway freight train hurtling down the track.
<p>
The ball of light in Vegeta's hand grew brighter, and the snake
squinted, great eyelids half-closed.  "Gotten a bit shy about your
eyes and tender mouth, have you?" Vegeta mocked. Then he hurled the
moon ki high, almost to the roof of the immense cavern.
<p>
It exploded, swelling into a ball of blazing moonlight; Vegeta laughed
as he felt himself begin to transform.
<p>
Apep hurtled toward Vegeta--
<p>
--and passed him! Immense mouth agape, the Night Serpent hurled
himself at the ball of moonlight. Jaws of Stygian night opened
impossibly wide, surrounded the light, devoured it. Vegeta's moonlight
vanished, winking out like a candle swallowed by a whale.
<p>
Downward the hell-serpent plunged, down into the Stygian Nile, and
beyond. Vegeta, his aborted transformation fading quickly away,
watched as the great snake shattered the very bed of the river, and
plunged into darkness absolute. With a final flick of his tail, the
Serpent of Darkness vanished into the abyss; all the waters of the
river drained after him.
<p>
"I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!" Prince Vegeta gaped at the hole in the
riverbed. "HE ATE MY MOON! <i>Chikusho</i>!" The Saiyan prince dropped down
to the riverbank beside the Ferryman's beached ship, and reverted to
his normal black-haired form.
<p>
The Ferryman was already ashore, inspecting the damage to his ship's
hull. He chuckled, a deep rumbling sound.  "Snake thinks you are the
sun god. Thinks your moon ball--"
<p>
"--is the sun!" Vegeta threw up his hands in disgust. "What an
incredibly stupid monster! Now what?"
<p>
"Hmph. Now, I fix my boat." The Ferryman walked along the bank,
picking up pieces of driftwood here and there.
<p>
"No, what happens with that snake and that huge hole in the river? You
can't sail without water, and I'm not where I need to be!"
<p>
The dark Ferryman dropped the pile of wood beside the boat, climbed
back aboard, and emerged with tools. Kadru peered over the side to
watch; Modgudh climbed down beside them.
<p>
The Ferryman grunted, "Snake thinks it won--it ate the sun for the
first time since creation. Have to patch the hull and unstep the mast
before we go on." The dark man grinned, lips drawing back from teeth
and tusks. "Snake made a shortcut--broke the barrier of Time's
Beginning. Helldarks are down that hole. Rough ride to get there."
He began to trim driftwood planks to fit.
<p>
Vegeta looked over at the cataract plunging into the dark abyss. "I
don't believe this!" he repeated.
<p>
"I haven't believed most of this nightmare since Papa shoved me into
your arms," Princess Kadru said, "but still I am here." She sighed.
<p>
"Woman, you would stand a much better chance of finding a husband to
your liking if you would stop the incessant whining!" Vegeta snarled
through gritted teeth.
<p>
Modgudh's bare skull looked up at the Naga Princess. "He speaks the
truth, surprised though I am to admit it." Beyond her, the Ferryman
finished shaving a board down and tested its fit against the hole in
the hull.
<p>
Vegeta smirked at Modgudh's comment. "And don't go on about how plain
you think you are, or how poor you are without all your baubles, or
what terrible hardships you're putting up with--YOU'RE the one who
decided to follow me around! You spend so much time whining about what
you haven't got or what you aren't that you completely ignore what you
ARE!" He folded his arms, sneering.
<p>
Bam! Bam! Bam! The Ferryman nailed the plank into place, and moved on
to the next hole.
<p>
Modgudh chuckled hollowly. "Lightning strikes twice in the same
place!"
<p>
Kadru glared at Modgudh and Prince Vegeta in turn. "I did not <i>decide</i>
to be thrown out of my own house into the arms of the first passing
stranger of noble lineage! THAT was Papa's doing! I think I have done
the best I could under the circumstances--and what I haven't got is a
husband!" She folded her arms and glared fiercely at Vegeta, tail
writhing and coiling. "Even you can't argue with that fact!"
<p>
On the ground, the Ferryman picked over the driftwood boards, selected
two that suited him, and began to trim them down.
<p>
"That's not a fact, that's your stupid obsession again! You should
marry Prince Khara--you're exactly what he likes in a woman!" Vegeta
snapped, disgusted.
<p>
"Prince Khara?  Khara of Lanhka, the son of the Rakshasa King?"
Princess Kadru asked, wondering.
<p>
"I don't know of any other!"
<p>
"Would he really want a wife like me?" Kadru looked hopeful.
<p>
Vegeta stared at her. She was taking his casual insult seriously!  And
the very conservative Prince Khara was unmarried...
<p>
"Unless he hates snakes, you'd be perfect for him!"  Vegeta smirked.
<p>
The Ferryman finished hammering the last boards into place, and
climbed back up on the canted deck.  He began to unstep the remnant of
the mast.
<p>
Princess Kadru made her decision. "You will introduce me to him," she
announced.
<p>
Prince Vegeta stared at her contemptuously. "Spare me your delusions!"
<p>
Behind Kadru, the Ferryman finished unstepping the mast, and threw the
shattered pole down to the beach. He jumped down beside it.
<p>
Undeterred, Kadru continued, "You are a prince and my father gave me
into your care; it would be appropriate for you to arrange the
marriage. First we will have to visit my mother, though."
<p>
"Enough, snake-woman! The universe may fall into quaking ruin long
before any of that matters!" Vegeta snarled in exasperation.
<p>
"This will do for rollers;" the Ferryman announced to no one in
particular, "I need a new mast." He stared at Vegeta. "You in a
hurry?"
<p>
"I would like to get moving before the heat-death of the universe sets
in!" Vegeta snarled, still exasperated.
<p>
"You're fast; fly along the shore, look for a good mast pole," the
Ferryman grunted. "I'll move the ship. Get done sooner that way." He
took out a bronze-toothed saw, and, with a shimmer of power, started
cutting the old mast into sections, paying no further attention to
Vegeta.
<p>
"Hmmph! Well, if it gets this thing moving..."
<p>

<p>
"You summoned me, father?" Prince Khara bowed before his father, the
King of the Rakshasas.
<p>
King Vibishana sat in his study, at an ornately inlaid teak desk. Two
pieces of paper lay before him; one, an ancient yellowed scroll; the
other, a crisp, newly printed letter on plain white paper. He picked
up the latter and handed to Khara.
<p>
"Yes, I did. Explain this, please." Vibishana's face was
expressionless.
<p>
Prince Khara glanced at the paper; it was a printed copy of his e-mail
notice to Sinhika. "Sir, you expressed your displeasure at my sister's
abrupt departure, and I took it on myself to get her to return. I
calculated that if gentle persuasion did not suffice, financial
pressure might."
<p>
Vibishana frowned. "I am disappointed that Sinhika left without taking
counsel with me, and I am concerned for her.. <i>as a father</i>. If I were
concerned <i>as King</i>, I need only command her to return, and she would
obey. I know that, she knows that, and YOU know that. YOU have no
business commanding your sister in anything, or cutting her off from
the treasury without my command!"
<p>
"But--" Khara stepped back, flustered at his father's anger.
<p>
"Fate has placed Sinhika exactly where the King of Lankha needs her;
you will not interfere. Indeed, you will restore her access to the
treasury this very night, and then you will go to Satan City and
assist your sister in any way she sees fit." Cold sapphire eyes glared
into gentle emerald eyes, until the latter dropped away to stare at
the floor.
<p>
"And," the Rakshasa King added in a gentler voice, "you will give
Sinhika this." Vibishana picked up the aged scroll and handed it to
his son. "She will know what to do with it when the time is right."
<p>
Prince Khara's eyes widened; he thought he recognized it, from his
long hours of study with Ghost Prince Vegeta amid the ancient lore of
Lankha. "Is that--?"
<p>
"Yes, it is the Mantra of Compassion, that I gave to Hanuman in the
long ago, to restore the slain armies of Rama to life." The ebon king
smiled gently. "It will soon be time for it to be used again, by
another of compassionate heart."
<p>
"Sinhika?" Prince Khara raised one eyebrow in skepticism.
<p>
"Not hardly--but she will know who must use it."
<p>
"It shall be done, my king," Prince Khara bowed low, and backed out of
his father's presence at the sign of dismissal.
<p>
After his departure, the ebony-skinned king walked to the window and
looked out over the ocean once more.
<p>
So... It is done. Khara is faithful, if unimaginative; he will find
her and do his part. This new Indra, Dende.. in spite of his youth, he
is like the previous one, wise and restrained, not arrogant and
lustful like the Indras of my youth. He will do well--my devious
nephew could never have blinded this one with the illusions of the
world!
<p>
It is time for me to do my part. King Vibishana turned from the tall
window, and headed for a certain stair.
<p>
It is time to command Indrajit.
<p>

<p>
The daughter of Vibishana crouched on the sloped roof of a
temple. "Again," she growled silently to herself, "they're doing it
again! <i>Aghammanul anaarya</i>! Butchers!" She pried open a wooden louver
and slipped inside. "With all the chaos from the earthquake, who is to
stop them? Who will even notice, among all the dead?"
<p>
Sinhika looked down from her perch on a rafter; the thugs had already
done their work. An old man sprawled on the floor, beaten bloody and
unconscious, as did two young acolytes. A third was held by two
grinning thugs in T-shirts and jeans, while yet another punched him
repeatedly in the stomach.
<p>
The Rakshasa princess squinted; she'd seen that last thug before. He
was a burly man wearing a tight black shirt that showed off his
muscles and black jeans--yes! He was the third man who'd escaped her
at the very first temple! Her eyes narrowed; he would not escape this
time!
<p>
In what illusion would she walk?  Not a temple guardian this time, she
decided. Something.. more traditional.  Sinhika grinned, baring fangs
and flexed her claws--and fell upon the burly man in black.
<p>
Oshimu drew his fist back for one more blow on the helpless
acolyte--it never fell. Something like a monstrous orangutang fell out
of the rafters onto his back, knocking him to the floor.  The breath
was smashed out of him, and he barely had time to realize his plight
before two hairy hands grabbed Oshimu's head on each side and
twisted--
<p>
CRACK! The two other thugs looked on in stunned horror as the
ape-demon stood over Oshimu's corpse and grinned at them, baring
sharp teeth. Great claws bent backwards from the hairy beast's palms;
it turned slowly--
<p>
WHOMMPHH! A shadow lashed out, catching the ape-demon hard in the
side, flinging it across the room. The shadow grew and solidified,
finally standing some nine massively muscled feet tall with
smouldering red eyes. The ape-demon got its feet as Enforcer strode
across the room, taloned arm upraised to strike.
<p>
Even as Enforcer's talons slashed down, the ape-demon vanished!
Enforcer's head snapped around, looked up, and behind. No sign of his
enemy.. the demon growled, scarlet eyes narrowing.
<p>
Suddenly the ape-demon reappeared, great claws raking across
Enforcer's back--and skittering off the shadow demon's scaly
hide. Quick as thought, the great demon lashed out with his talons,
slicing into the ape-demon--
<p>
--and meeting no resistance. Illusion! Enforcer snarled in frustration
as the ape-demon vanished. Nostrils flared; the shadow demon could
smell the other creature's presence, but that wasn't enough to pin it
down, to allow Enforcer to attack. Did it have to materialize to
attack?
<p>
No! Something invisible crashed into the chaos demon's chest, and
rebounded.  Unseen claws slashed his throat, leaving no mark.
Enforcer grinnned, revealing far too many razor-sharp teeth for any
natural creature.
<p>
"Children of darkness, come your master's call!"  Enforcer
growled. "Come forth, ancient shades!"
<p>
Shadows stretched out across the floor, grew, and pooled together. The
two remaining thugs huddled together in a rapidly disappearing spot of
light. The barely conscious acolyte screamed in stark terror as the
darkness closed over his head--
<p>
Sinhika snarled soundlessly as she hovered high above, cloaked in
illusion, near the rafters. She glared at the living darkness filling
the ground floor; she heard two screams as it enveloped the thugs,
followed by fading moans and one last despairing cry:
<p>
"Help me, Lord Keikan-Ma! It is so cold! So cold..."
<p>
Silence, and only the red-eyed shadow demon looking up and about, with
darkness lapping about his thighs.  Enforcer laughed softly, and
raised his taloned hands.
<p>
A ball of dark violet, red and black lightnings roiled in each hand. I
don't like the look of this, Sinhika thought, as the great
shadow-demon flung both balls of dark energy into the air--
<p>
CRACK--BOOM! BOOM! Both spheres exploded in blasts of dark lightning,
shattering the temple in cascades of violet, red and black electrical
fire. One bolt caught Sinhika, blasting her backwards through the
wall, just as the wall collapsed in flaming fragments. Her head struck
a chunk of support beam, and Enforcer's mocking laughter rang in her
ears as everything went black...

<p>
Pomona's head ached, she was incredibly thirsty, and her body felt
like one huge bruise. That was the first thing she noticed. The second
was that she was tied up and lying on her side someplace incredibly
dusty. She sneezed.
<p>
"Po?" Melchior's voice called softly from behind her. About the same
time, Pomona realized there was something warm pressed up against her
back.
<p>
"Melc, that you?" As soon as she said it, Pomona realized the idiocy
of the question.
<p>
Melchior chuckled. "If you mean, am I the guy trussed up like a hog
laying against you, yes, that's me."
<p>
Pomona opened her eyes. It didn't help much; wherever they were, it
was dark. "Where are we?"
<p>
"Locked in a shed somewhere," answered Melchior. "Can't tell much
else."
<p>
"I don't like this," Pomona said. "What are they going to do to us?"
<p>
"Considering Voron's usual interests.. I have a guess--and I don't
really want to think about it. I think he's really gone over the edge
this time." Melchior was more melancholy than usual.
<p>
Both of them fell silent at the sound of someone turning a key in a
lock; a door opened, and a small electric lamp lit up the interior of
the shed that was their prison.  Voron walked over to the two
prisoners, and looked them over, smirking.
<p>
"No too uncomfortable, are you?" Behind him, two other men carrying a
burden entered the shed; as they put their burden down, Pomona noticed
that it was a woman, tied up and unconscious.
<p>
Pomona just glared at the long-haired young man in the black leather
coat. Behind her, Melchior muttered, "We'd both be a lot more
comfortable if you dropped dead on the spot, but what the hell--I
don't usually get what I want."
<p>
Voron laughed maliciously. The two men left and returned, this time
carrying a small boy, whom they set down beside the woman.
<p>
"Don't worry, we won't harm a hair on your heads--not until the
sacrifice." Voron grinned wickedly. "I need you at your very best of
health and power."
<p>
"Damn. I was right; you <i>have</i> gone over the edge!" Melchior cursed.
<p>
"Is that what you call it? I say that I have broken through the wall
of human limitations--limits imposed by small, narrow minds full of
petty concerns. I told you before--I have <i>real</i> power now! I will
have yet more, when your bodies and souls are traded for Lord
Dairi-Mao's demons--demons under <i>my</i> command!" Voron smirked, and
raised the lamp high. Pomona noticed the unconscious woman's blue
hair, and the boy's violet hair.
<p>
"Don't worry, you'll die quickly enough.  These, on the other hand,"
Voron nudged the other captives with his foot, "my Lord Dairi-Mao has
plans for. They will long for death, they will beg for it for hours
and hours before we permit it to take them--and then we will feed
their souls to Chaos. And just think," Voron giggled, "the demons we
summon using your lives will make it all possible."

&lt;Gohan!&gt; Piccolo's mindvoice echoed in the young Saiyan's head.
<p>
&lt;Piccolo?&gt;
<p>
&lt;Someone has kidnapped Bulma and Trunks! Watch your little brother;
they'll be after him next.&gt;
<p>
Gohan's eyes widened. &lt;What?? Can you find them? We need to tell Dad!&gt;
<p>
&lt;I'm looking for them. You worry about your little brother, Gohan. The
demon is after him, and Raditz--but he thinks Raditz is dead. So did
I.&gt; Gohan could hear the ironic amusement in Piccolo's thought.
<p>
&lt;The demon was almost right, Piccolo. If Dad doesn't get back with
senzu soon...&gt;  The worry in Gohan's thought was papable.
<p>
&lt;I don't like Raditz, but I like the demon that was killing him even
less. If Raditz alive hinders this demon, I'll put up with that
wretched Saiyan for now.&gt;
<p>
&lt;He's not that bad.. not anymore.&gt; Gohan answered.
<p>
&lt;I haven't killed him yet, have I?&gt; A minute taste of Piccolo Dai-mao
flavored the Namek's thoughts, then he continued in a less sinister
flavor. &lt;I'll put up with him, for you and for Son Goku&gt;.
<p>
&lt;Thank you, Piccolo-Sensei!&gt;
<p>
&lt;No, thank YOU, Gohan.&gt;
<p>

<p>
"Gohan! Help me here!" Chi-chi called from the bedside. "He's going
into convulsions again!"
<p>
Gohan turned his attention back to his mother and Raditz. The
long-maned Saiyan was regaining consciousness--or some delirious state
that wasn't merciful unconsciousness.  His face was drawn with pain,
and he tried to claw at the poisoned wounds on his chest and tear away
the bandages. It was all Gohan and Chi-chi could do to hold Raditz
down and restrain him--fortunately he was so terribly weak that
Chi-chi <i>could</i> hold him down with her full strength.
<p>
Raditz arched his back, and the veins stood out on the backs of his
hands and on his forehead as he writhed in pain, then collapsed again,
too weak to fight anymore. Sweat drenched him; blood trickled from his
nose and the corner of his mouth.  His breath came in great ragged
gasps, as if he'd been fighting long and hard.
<p>
Through this and all the other intervals of merciless consciousness,
the Saiyan warrior had remained silent, teeth clenched together,
refusing to cry out in his agony.  Now he laid back, a slightly
puzzled look on his face. "Kinoko?"
<p>
Raditz began to speak quietly but rapidly in a language Chi-chi did
not recognize.  She looked at Gohan questioningly.
<p>
"I think it's Saiya-go; I heard Vegeta say words like that once or
twice." Gohan said hesitantly. He recognized a few names: Kakarott,
Bardock, Vegeta, Bulma, Goten, his own name, Trunks.  Gohan looked at
his mother, confused.
<p>
Chi-chi shook her head. "He's delirious." And dying, her somber face
showed. "Gohan, take Goten out. He doesn't need to see this. Neither
do you."
<p>
Goten, who was still sitting at the foot of the bed, staring at the
blank wall behind the bed, suddenly spoke up. "N'Uncle Raditz talks to
the lady with long hair like him. Am NOT leaving!" he objected.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Oh gods, the pain! Even Hell didn't hurt like this--that was all pain
of the soul, emptiness and loss and sorrow and eternal regret--not
this mortal agony. It feels like I'm on fire inside, and
disintegrating one cell at a time. Why won't it stop? It just goes on
and on...
<p>
*Your body is fighting to survive, Raditz*
<p>
"Kinoko?" Mother? How.. oh. I'm dying again. That's why I can see you,
isn't it?
<p>
*Yes*  Cool fingers stroked his face, taking away the pain. *Do not
worry; you will be fine*
<p>
Will I live? A dim echo of the fever and pain still raged through his
body, but her touch cooled him, calmed him; he could think coherently
again.
<p>
*I do not know, my son*
<p>
How can I be fine if I die.. oh. Oh! Surprise blocked out the
remaining pain for a short time, and he smiled. Something else to
blame on Kakarott--or perhaps Goten and Bulma, too. His smile faded
abruptly as Raditz remembered other concerns.
<p>
But I can't die, not now! The demon is after Bulma and Trunks, and I
promised Prince Vegeta I'd protect them! And Goten.. I can't protect
any of them if I'm dead!
<p>
*I know. It is not an easy path you walk, my son, but you are a Saiyan
warrior! Have we ever taken the easy path?*
<p>
Raditz smiled again, much to the amazement of a bewildered Chi-chi and
Gohan.  Well, every time we did, it turned out to be a mistake!
Frieza, the 'Planet Trade'.. No, the easy path is not for us--but
there <i>is</i> a path for us, a hard path, but still our path!
Heh. Somehow it makes sense that we have to go to Hell to get to
Heaven.
<p>
Ghostly feminine laughter. *Even your blessed brother Goku managed to
fall into Hell before getting to Heaven!*
<p>
Goku! But.. you yourself named my little brother, named him Kakarott!
That is his real name, his Saiyan name! Mother, how could you abandon
it?
<p>
*I have met the one who named him Son Goku, dear Raditz, and he is a
good man and it is a good name.  In his heart and soul, your little
brother knows himself as Goku, and I honor his choice.  Search your
heart, Raditz, and you will understand*
<p>
Raditz remembered what he'd told his little brother, when he'd
explained why he still called him 'Kakarott'.

<p><I>"Kakarott is the name of the little brother I loved, the name mother
and father gave you, on our home world. Our parents, who loved both of
us, who died with our world," Raditz had said. "Goku is the name of a
Saiyan who did not know me, who renounced his family and race, and who
killed me.  I like Kakarott better."
</I></p>
<p>
Only.. it wasn't Kakarott who gave me a second chance, it wasn't
Kakarott who forgave me and embraced me as a brother, it wasn't
Kakarott who accepted me into his house and thanked me for saving his
sons. It was Goku.
<p>

<p>
"Mom! What's wrong? He's so pale.." Gohan looked anxiously at his
mother.
<p>
Chi-chi felt Raditz's forehead, and frowned, moving to check the pulse
at his neck. "Fever's gone.. he's cold, and I can barely feel his
pulse.." Chi-chi met Gohan's eyes, and shook her head again. "He's in
shock. Not long now," she said sadly.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
A delicious coolness spread through Raditz. It's stopped hurting.
<p>
*Yes. Your body has given up the fight*
<p>
I'm dead?
<p>
No regrets, this time, for what he'd done. Only a few regrets for
chances missed... a laughing brown-haired girl he'd like to have known
better, a blue-haired princess who'd stolen his heart, a nephew and a
young prince he'd wanted to teach, a brother he'd need a lifetime to
know...
<p>
*Not quite yet*
<p>
Oh. I hope little brother gets back in time; I'd like to say goodbye
to him.
<p>
Raditz could see his mother Kinoko very clearly now; she was even more
beautiful than he remembered from his youth. He'd gotten his long
hair, height, and delicate features from her. Her hair almost swept
the floor, and she was only a few inches shorter than Raditz. Her face
had a delicate, almost elfin beauty to it--very unusual among
Saiyajin. Here and now, she wore a long white satiny dress with her
brown furry tail wrapped around it at the waist, not the Saiyan battle
armor he remembered seeing her in last. If only father could see her
like this!
<p>
Until his reunion in Hell with his father, Raditz had not understood
the real reason Bardock had sent him away, out of his life--his
too-close resemblance to his mother, and Bardock's unending pain at
Kinoko's death. She had been killed just after Kakarott's birth, a few
short months before Bardock's last, accursed mission to Kunassasei.
<p>
I don't think father knew he was saving my life when he sent me
away--pulled strings and got me assigned to that scouting mission out
in the backass of nowhere, even though I was supposed to have been
assigned a permanent post in the Royal Guard, on Vegetasai.  He just
wanted me offworld and away from any place he might see me for a long,
long time.
<p>
I didn't exactly thank him for it, either. At first, I was just angry
and disappointed--what had I done wrong?  Had I somehow managed to
disqualify myself from the Guards?  I was even more angry when I found
out my father had been responsible--what right did he have to ruin my
career before it really got started?  How had I offended him? There
was no reason that I could see.
<p>
After the destruction of Vegetasai, I cursed him for my survival. The
last thing I wanted to be was the weakest of Frieza's three surviving
Saiyan slaves! Then, part of me wished I'd died on Vegetasai, even the
stupid, useless death of being destroyed by some wandering bit of
space debris. Clever of Frieza to tell us that--it shamed us that the
rest of our race had died such un-Saiyan deaths, and made us all the
more willing to fight for him. How long did Vegeta know the truth,
before Nappa stumbled on it and enlightened me?
<p>
Not that it matters now. They're all dead--Vegeta, Nappa, Frieza,
father.. and soon me, again. But.. I was unjust to father, not knowing
the reasons for what he did, not knowing the truth.
<p>
Mother.. we need to save father.
<p>
A light chuckle. *Bardock will be easy. You were the stubborn one, my
son* A light, cool kiss on Raditz's forehead. *Teach him what you have
learned, and he will be fine*
<p>
Someone else, far away was talking to him, asking him to do
something. Someone.. his brother. But it was so much work, and Kinoko
was rising to leave...
<p>
Mother? Don't go! Raditz started to get up, to follow her--
<p>
"NUNK RATS! DON'T GO!" A child's wail of despair cut through the
cocoon of shock his dying body had wrapped around his mind. "PLEASE!
LISTEN TO DADDY!"
<p>
Sorry, Goten, I'm just so tired. I can't fight anymore.. Goodbye,
little brother. I'll see you again someday.
<p>
"Raditz.. please! Just chew on this, and you can go back to sleep! I
promise! For me, please?" Little brother was pleading--<i>crying</i>?? This
must be important to him.
<p>
Oh, all right, just for you. And stop carrying on like that--you're a
Saiyan! Show some pride!
<p>
Raditz bit down with his last effort--
<p>
AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH! His eyes snapped wide open as warmth and strength
flooded into him. He could feel the poison vanish from his blood, and
all the terrible wounds closing, healing. Raditz breathed again,
taking in fresh air and life. His little brother stood beside the bed,
looking down at him, joy on his face. He quickly wiped a tear away,
but Raditz saw it.
<p>
Raditz slowly smiled at his brother. "I guess I don't need to say
goodbye after all.. Goku."

Nezumi stared at the ruins of her apartment building. Slabs of broken
concrete and bent iron poked this way and that, looming out of the
gloom like some alien badlands that had materialized where her home
should be. Nezumi played the flashlight this way and that, looking for
signs of.. she didn't know what.
<p>
No sounds or signs of anyone remaining. It had taken her hours to work
her way through the shattered city to her home, and it was gone. There
was nothing and no one for her here. Nezumi sighed.
<p>
"What are you going to do now, young lady?" Nezumi giggled at the
sound of her own stern voice. "I'm starting to sound like Mom! Well, I
can either sleep in the street--ick!--see if Lina's place is still
intact, or go back to Capsule Corp HQ; I <i>know</i> part of the compound
is still standing." She leaned the flashlight against her chin.
<p>
"Hmmm.. I know the safe route back to Capsule Corp now; wouldn't take
me nearly as long to get back--or I could slog my way through this
disaster for several more hours on the off chance that Lina and her
apartment survived. Gods, I hope Lina is all right-- but I'm
exhausted!"
<p>
She sighed again. "I hate to admit it, but Raditz was right and I was
wrong--better to do this the safe way, no matter how I feel about
it. Back to Capsule Corp it is."
<p>
With that, Nezumi flicked her flashlight back on, and guided herself
back through the ruined city, the light in her off hand, and a
large-caliber revolver in her right hand.

In his curiously intact ancient apartment building, Sean considered
the light. Not good enough; he lit another candle, another black
one. Four black candles, three red ones, and one purple; he'd
forgotten what the purple one was for--probably a love spell Po had
wanted to try out. Sean thought candlelight itself was romantic
enough.
<p>
In any case, his taste for candlelit rendezvous had left him with a
large supply of slow-burning candles on a night when there was no
power nor lights to be had in the city. Sean smiled to himself; gothic
romance turned out to be practical! At least he had enough light to
sketch by.

Between worry about Sinhika and the latest image in his head, he
couldn't sleep. He might as well get some sketching done.  Candlelight
wouldn't do for the painting he had in mind; he'd have to wait for
morning light, but he could at least sketch out a preliminary drawing.
<p>
A few sweeping lines to frame out the scene, rough circles for the
body, rocks, bushes, a few dots to indicate the flowers; then he
started to delineate the face and hair and form a bit more
clearly. Engrossed in his drawing, Sean did not hear the slow turning
of his doorknob, nor the scratching as someone slipped a jimmy behind
the bolt...
<p>

<p>
Sinhika awoke with a gasp as something utterly cold wrapped itself
around her. Everything was dark and silent and cold, the cold
emptiness of oblivion, something seemed to whisper to her. Fear rose
in her, fear of that oblivion, fear of non-being, of eternal darkness
and nothingness; terror took hold of her and her heart hammered
frantically in her breast until it seemed as if her chest would
explode. She could not breathe, she was so terrified.
<p>
NO! I am a Princess of Lankha, and the daugher of the immortal
Rakshasa King! I am not a rabbit, to cower in fear of the unknown; I
am not a peasant, to cower in fear of death! I am a warrior and the
daughter of heroes! Anger coursed through her, and shame at her own
fear; bit by bit, she fought the panic and terror down.
<p>
By rakshasa instinct, she wrapped herself in the illusion of
invisiblity, and flew up through the seemingly endless darkness.  A
bright light flashed over her, nearly blinded her; the darkness was
very shallow after all. She was still in the temple, or what was left
of it.  Below her, a pool of living darkness washed the floor, slowly
receding; in the center of the ruins stood the great shadow demon
Keikan-Ma, his head turning this way and that as he inspected the
ruins in the wake of the receding darkness.
<p>
The cold, the silence, the unnatural fear all left her the instant
Sinhika rose above the darkness. She stared at it, scraps of forgotten
lore lurking at the edges of memory, teasing her. Sinhika had heard of
this darkness before, in some ancient tale.. if only she could
remember the details!
<p>
The darkness receded completely, leaving only the normal shadows and
night's gloom on the smouldering ruins of the temple. In its wake, six
corpses lay strewn about the floor. Six cold, frost-covered corpses
whose faces were contorted in expressions of ultimate terror. Above
them stood Keikan-Ma, eyes intently searching the bodies and fallen
rubble. After long moments, the demon growled, and plunged through the
broken wall into the night.
<p>
Silent as an owl, Sinhika followed invisibly. The great shadow demon
disappeared into the shadows, became invisible to any eyes but a
rakshasa's. Princess Sinhika had inherited her father's eyes.

Raditz clenched his fist and looked at it, smirking. He glanced at
Goku. "I am stronger, a lot stronger. Those magic beans of yours are
impressive. Healed me faster and better than a regen tank. Heh."  The
long-haired Saiyan grinned wolfishly. "I was about even with that damn
demon, until he regenerated himself; next time.. will be the last
time!"
<p>
"Raditz--"
<p>
"Goku! Raditz! Gohan! Goten! Everybody, midnight supper is ready!" Chi-chi
called from the kitchen.
<p>
Goku's eyes widened. "I'm starving! After bringing you home, I went to
Karin's Tower to get the senzu, and I missed dinner completely!  I
can't believe Chi-chi didn't yell at me about it! I can't believe I
forgot to eat!" Goku rushed down the hall. Gohan waited for his little
brother.
<p>
Raditz got up to follow, when Goten grabbed his arm. "N'Uncle Raditz,
was that lady my grandma?"
<p>
Raditz looked startled for a moment, then his lips quirked up in a
hint of a smile. "Yes, she was.  Kinoko is your other
grandmother--your father's mother." Gohan looked on, very startled.
<p>
Goten nodded. "Grandpa N'Ox-King is Mama's father." He looked at his uncle,
wide-eyed and solemn. "Who is Daddy's father?"
<p>
Raditz hesitated. "My father, your grandfather, was named Bardock. He
looked just like your father, only more tanned, and he had a scar
here," Raditz drew his forefinger down his left cheek. "He.. died a
long time ago."
<p>
"Oh. Uncle Raditz, I don't understand Grandma Kinoko. How can you be
all right if you die?" Goten looked puzzled and worried; Gohan's jaw
dropped.
<p>
Raditz didn't answer for a long moment. "I don't really know how to
explain that. Tell you what, kid.. I'll explain it when I figure out
how. Fair enough?"
<p>
"Okay. Fair.  Hungry; let's eat!"  Goten ran down the hall.
<p>
Gohan looked at Raditz and gulped. "I keep forgetting my brother can
see ghosts--that's what Goten was talking about, wasn't he?"
<p>
Raditz smiled wryly. "Yeah. An ancestral ghost dropped by for a chat
while I was busy nearly becoming a ghost myself. Again. Bad habit,
that.  Let's go eat." Raditz ducked his head to miss the doorjamb as
he followed Gohan down the hall.
<p>
And Dad was with me when I fought Cell, Gohan thought. I wonder how
often it happens that way..
<p>
Goku had already finished his first, second and third helping of
dinner and was well into his fourth. Goten was just getting started as
Raditz entered the kitchen. Chi-chi sighed, grabbed the empty rice
bowl and filled it from the pot on the stove; she knew that Gohan and
Raditz each ate almost as much as Goku.
<p>
"Dad, can you find Bulma and Trunks?" Gohan asked as he sat down.
<p>
"What do you mean, 'find Bulma and Trunks'?" Raditz asked slowly. He
halted in the kitchen entry, a suspicious, almost angry look on his
face. He was still barefoot, wearing nothing more than borrowed blue
pants; his chest still partially wrapped in bandages.
<p>
"I didn't have a chance to tell Dad yet, you were dying when he got
back with the senzu--Piccolo told me. Someone's kidnapped Bulma and
Trunks!"
<p>
Goku looked up sharply, noting the horror on his brother's
face. "Raditz--"
<p>
CRASH! A hole gaped where the back door used to be; Raditz was gone.
<p>
"Good thing that door opens in the direction of Satan City," Goku
laughed nervously as Chi-chi glared at the shattered door. "I'd hate
to see what he would have done to the wall.." He got up from the
table, raising two fingers to his forehead...
<p>
Chi-chi transferred her glare to Goku.  "And just where do you think
you're going?"  The chill in her voice could have frozen a lava flow
on the spot.
<p>
"Chi-chi, I have to go after my brother, and help find Bulma and
Trunks! Gohan and I---"
<p>
"ABSOLUTELY NOT! I forbid it!" Chi-chi yelled. "You are not taking
Gohan anywhere, it's the middle of the night and way past his bedtime!
And you are not just flying out of here and leaving the door wide-open
and us completely unprotected from those demons!  A demon tried to
kidnap little Goten and me once, or have you forgotten that already??"
<p>
"But Chi-chi, Raditz--"
<p>
"Raditz is a grown man and can take care of himself for a few minutes!
You aren't going anywhere until there's a door in front of that hole,
and Gohan is going TO BED!" Chi-chi switched her glare to Gohan. "As
soon as you and Goten are done eating, get ready for bed, young man!"
<p>
"Okay, you're right! Gohan should stay home--he can protect you and
Goten. Can I just nail some boards over the hole until morning?  I
can't really do a good job of hanging a door in the dark, anyway."
Goku pleaded with Chi-chi.
<p>
"All right. Fine. But first thing in the morning, you will be HERE,
and fixing that door--if you want to eat. I refuse to cook breakfast
looking at a boarded-up eyesore. Better yet, get Raditz to fix it--he
broke it!" Chi-chi folded her arms and frowned at her husband.
<p>
A short time later, Goku finished boarding up the hole in the wall,
and Chi-chi put the boys to bed. Chi-chi escorted Goku to the front
door, kerosene lamp held high. "Goku..."
<p>
"Don't worry, Chi-chi--I can handle whatever has Bulma and Trunks;
I'll be back for breakfast!" Goku said cheerily.  He put two fingers
to his forehead, and vanished in a flicker of light.
<p>
"I hope so," Chi-chi said wistfully. "I really hope so." She tumbled
into bed, alone; in spite of her loneliness, she fell asleep from
sheer exhaustion within minutes. Everyone in the house slept the sleep
of the just.

<p>
The lights of Capsule Corp's gate lit the end of the street; Nezumi
sighed with relief. Not only had she made it back without being
attacked or falling into a hole, someone--probably Dr. Briefs--had
gotten the Capsule Corp generators on-line. There was something
incredibly reassuring about the warm glow of electric lights in the
midst of the blacked-out, broken city.
<p>
She stumbled up to the main gate, exhausted, and stared blankly at the
closed gate for a moment.  Right, whoever's got security detail would
hardly leave it standing wide open on a night like this, would they? She
fumbled in her wallet for a keycard, and swiped it through the
electronic lock.  The light stayed red.
<p>
Huh?  It should have turned green and unlocked. She swiped the card
again, and swore under her breath as it stayed red. Okay, she'd do
this the hard way; she walked around to the small personnel gate and
unlocked the padlock with her key.
<p>
"Hold it right there!" The sound of a shotgun slide being pumped
convinced Nezumi to obey instantly.
<p>
"Hey! What's going on? I work here!" Nezumi complained, holding very
still while someone shined a flashlight in her eyes.
<p>
"Nezumi! It's really you!" exclaimed a familiar voice, and the light
was quickly turned away. "You're all right! Come on in!"
<p>
Nezumi blinked. "Lina! Is that you?  You're okay!"  Nezumi ran up and
hugged her friend, shotgun and all.  "I thought you were at home, and
caught in the earthquake!"
<p>
Lina set down the shotgun and hugged her back. "I was on my way home,
but the street fell in in front of me, so I came back to work, and
they really needed one of us from Security to take charge with the
disaster and all, so.." The dark-haired woman shrugged.
<p>
"That bum Kidoru still hasn't shown up?" Nezumi frowned.
<p>
"Nor is he likely to," Lina said grimly. "There's been some weird
things happening around here--someone's been using Kidoru's card to
disable the alarms and security computer, so I turned off the main
gate's card reader--I don't know what else has been compromised and I
don't have enough people to search the grounds. Sorry for the
inconvenience," she shrugged.
<p>
"I understand; it's been an inconvenient night all around." Nezumi
sighed.
<p>
"That's one way to put it! Believe me, I am glad to see you! Did you
bring your gun?" Lina picked the shotgun back up.
<p>
"Of course--do you think I'd have walked through this city without
it?"
<p>
"You WALKED from your apartment?? In this--my god!"
<p>
"Well, the buses weren't running..." Nezumi smiled weakly.
<p>
Thip! Someone dropped out of the sky to land in behind Nezumi and
Lina; both whirled. Lina leveled her shotgun, and Nezumi's gun was out
and pointed at the-- at Raditz! It was Raditz!
<p>
Nezumi was the first to lower her gun. "What the hell happened to
you?" she asked, staring at his bandage-taped chest and bare
feet. Lina stared; at a glare from Raditz, she started and pointed the
shotgun away from him.
<p>
"Where's Bulma and Trunks?" the long-haired warrior asked abruptly,
ignoring Nezumi's question.
<p>
"You don't know? I just got back here--what's going on?" Nezumi asked,
suddenly worried.
<p>
"Last I heard, they were in their house--how come you weren't here?"
Lina asked, also looking worried. "I thought you were still here, with
them."
<p>
"So did I," Nezumi added, more worried.
<p>
Raditz frowned, and surged into the air in a high arc that brought him
down in front of Bulma's small house. Nezumi turned to Lina and
shouted, "You keep watching the gate!" and ran across the compound
toward him.
<p>
Wait! A power nearby, suppressed... there! Hovering high above the
compound!  Raditz snarled to himself, and clenched his fists. The
veins stood out on the backs of his hands, and power seethed around
him.  Raditz darted into the air, his power a corona of white fire
around him.
<p>
Tall, broad-shoulders, swirling cape--he knew that figure! Raditz
halted abruptly in front of him with a flash of shed energy. Piccolo
regarded with cold, haughty eyes. The corner of his mouth slowly
curved up in a smirk.
<p>
"Oh. It's you." Raditz sneered, and dropped back down to the
house. The door was open--that was not right, not right at all.  He
plunged into the dark house, ready for a fight.
<p>
No one there.  "Where are they?" Raditz growled to himself, still
crouched in fighting stance. Still nothing appeared, either to attack
him or give him answers. He slowly straightened up, and ran through
the darkened house, lit only by his own power. He found only what
Piccolo had found before him.
<p>
Bulma and Trunks were gone. Deputy had made good his threats. Raditz
began to tremble with rage. A noise behind him--
<p>
Raditz whirled, one hand raised to strike, energy already glowing in
the palm of his hand. Nezumi threw up both arms, one still holding her
drawn gun, shielding her face from the fierce light.
<p>
"Stop! It's only me--Nezumi!" she squeaked.
<p>
"Fool woman!" Raditz growled as he lowered his arm, energy fading
away. "I nearly killed you. What are you doing here?"
<p>
Nezumi holstered her gun. "Doing my job as Acting Deputy Chief of
Security for Capsule Corp. Where's Bulma and Trunks?" Nezumi's voice
was still shaky.
<p>
"Missing." Raditz regarded her thoughtfully, eyes narrowing. "Are you
trained for this?"
<p>
"Huh? What kind of question is that? If you mean, am I trained to look
for missing people, yes! I used to be a cop, you know.  If you mean,
am I trained to get into the kind of fight you obviously are, hell no!
I don't play quite that rough."
<p>
Raditz picked up a small object from the floor and handed it to
her. "Someone got in here unnoticed, and used tranquilizer darts to
make sure of Trunks, possibly Bulma as well. They're both gone."
<p>
Nezumi looked at the small object Raditz had given her.  "Yep, it's a
tranq dart. It's pretty large, looks like the size they use for
bringing down big game at zoos and game parks." Her brows furrowed
with concern. "Unless it was nearly empty, that's way too high a dose
for a human being!"
<p>
"Fortunately, Trunks isn't human." At Nezumi's startled look Raditz
added, "He's half-Saiyan."  Raditz frowned. "I can't sense their ki,
but they'd be too weak to for me to sense if they were
tranquilized. I'm not sure I could sense Bulma no matter what her
condition. If she's outside this compound, only Vegeta--or maybe my
brother--could sense her; her ki is too weak."
<p>
"Why do I feel like I'm missing about ten chapters out of the middle
of the story?" She shook her head. "Fine, you work on that end of
it--I don't follow this 'ki' stuff anyway," Nezumi said. She turned on
the lights, saying "Let me take a look around..."
<p>
"Whoever did it left some nice footprints in the hall and in Bulma's
room." Nezumi noted a few minutes later, her nose close to the floor.
After a brief examination, she straightened up. "Two things: one, I
need to get my kit from the security building, and two, Raditz, you
still haven't told me what happened and why you weren't here."
<p>
"That's not important," growled Raditz, looking uncomfortable and
angry.
<p>
Nezumi straightened up, put her hands on her hips and glared at
Raditz. "The hell it isn't! You're Bulma's bodyguard, you vanish, she
vanishes, you turn up looking like a building fell on you--and I'm
Deputy Chief of Security in case you've forgotten! It's my JOB to
know!"
<p>
Raditz flushed. "Bulma.. dismissed me for the night. A demon attacked
me on the way to my brother's house--a demon that threatened Bulma,
Trunks and my nephew. Now Bulma and Trunks have been kidnapped."
<p>
"What do you mean, 'a demon threatened Bulma and Trunks'? Whoever made
these footprints wore size ten human shoes," Nezumi said skeptically.
<p>
"I meant exactly what I said," Raditz growled. "You don't need to know
the details--they were.. unpleasant."  He looked away.  "The demon has
human followers," Raditz added unexpectedly. "I've run into them
before, when they tried to kidnap my nephew."
<p>
"Oh, great! So there's some cult of demon-worshipping weirdos, and
their pet demon, after the Boss? Is that what you're telling me?"
Nezumi expostulated.
<p>
"Yes, exactly." Raditz confirmed. He stared at Nezumi, not quite sure
what to make of her. She reminded him of someone...
<p>
"Okay, then. For goodness sake's get dressed, and drop me off at the
security building on your way. I'll meet you back here in a few
minutes."
<p>
"That will do." He followed her outside. "Hang on!" Raditz grabbed
Nezumi around the waist and half-jumped, half-flew to the security
building in a single high bound. He set her down, and paused for a
moment.
<p>
"Since when are you 'Deputy Chief of Security'?" he asked.
<p>
"<i>Acting</i> Deputy Chief of Security," Nezumi corrected. "Hiregumi-San
is dead, you were missing, Kidoru is still missing, and Lina got back
first, so she's Acting Chief of Security. I got here second, that
makes me Acting Deputy Chief.  Clear?"
<p>
Raditz rose into the air, and smirked, looking down at Nezumi, arms
folded. "Indeed."
<p>

<p>
King Vibishana stood by a clear stream that flowed over a bed of white
marble pebble, through a forest of white-leaved trees with pale ivory
bark. His red velvet cloak stood out like a bloodstain in that pale
wood; beside him stood another colorful form in silver armor,
listening attentively.
<p>
"Uncle, in anger you once told me, 'War is all you ever knew, and
all your skill!'" Prince Indrajit bowed his head. "You were right; I
thought to seek Truth, yet in the end I sided with deceit; I thought
to do Right, yet I used all my powers to aid my father in doing
Wrong." The dead rakshasa sighed; his ancient silver armor glittered
with even that slight movement.
<p>
"That was long ago, and the price is long since paid," Vibishana
answered. "Why revisit it?"
<p>
"I sought the Truth, and believed that I had found it, presumed to
know Truth from the World's illusions. I presumed myself superior to
those who fought and killed for mere material things.  I, who snared a
god in illusion, deceived myself. You saw the truth about me, long
ago." Indrajit grinned, revealing a demon's hideous tusks and
teeth. "I delight in doing that in which I excel, and I excel at war!"
<p>
King Vibishana smiled. "Prepare to delight yourself; war comes!"
<p>

<p>
By the time Vegeta returned with a suitable mast timber, the black
boat was afloat, though stoutly moored to the shore.
<p>
"Good," the Ferryman grunted as he secured the timber on deck. "Ready
to go now."
<p>
Kadru voiced the question first. "We're really going to just sail down
that waterfall? That may be fine for Vegeta and Modgudh, but I'm not
dead yet, and am not in that much of a hurry to be dead!"
<p>
The Ferryman chuckled. "Fee paid, you ride my boat, I get you there
just as good as when you got on. Guaranteed!"
<p>
Vegeta asked the next question, "What did you mean by the 'barrier of
Time's Beginning'?  What lies below?" He gestured at the yawning
abyss.
<p>
The dark man rumbled, "Before Time, there was another Time, the Time
Before. That world is gone, but its hell, the Helldarks, still is
Before Time. Before the Time Before, is Chaos."
<p>
"So we have to go back in Time, to before the beginning of this
universe!" Vegeta bowed his head, awed by the enormity of the quest he'd
committed himself to. What am I doing?  If I make a mistake... No! I
cannot hesitate now; it's far too late.
<p>
Kadru looked puzzled, then comprehending, then puzzled again. "It is
the previous Cycle of Brahma, that is obvious, but how could Shiva
have failed to destroy the previous Lower World when the time came for
destruction and re-Creation?  I don't understand," she muttered.
<p>
Prince Vegeta raised his head to stare coldly at the
Ferryman. "Cacodemon comes from this Time Before Time, does he not?"
<p>
"Yes," the Ferryman snarled. "He is the weakest of the Chaos gods."
<p>
"The WEAKEST??" Vegeta's eyes widened. "That.. abomination.. is
<i>weak</i>?"
<p>
"Cacodemon is a broken piece of Wakboth the Devil. In the Time Before
Time, the Devil was broken; his pieces are weaker than the whole
gods. Is the Devil broken in your Time? If evil is strong in Time,
Cacodemon will be stronger, too."
<p>
Prince Vegeta's eyes narrowed; so the demon might be weaker at its
origin? Yet.. No! He dared not fight it here, where time and causality
could get hopelessly tangled up. Fighting the monster <i>before</i> it came
forward in Time to attack him would unravel the whole chain of events
that led him here--create a paradox at the beginning of Time. That
could be.. bad.
<p>
One paradox was more than enough. "One more thing, though it seems
obvious enough.. to attack me, Cacodemon had to come from this Time
Before Time to my Time. He travelled forward in Time, like a man with
a time machine, didn't he?"
<p>
The Ferryman cocked his head to one side and the other, looking at
Vegeta and making that odd chirping sound only Vegeta seemed to
hear. "Of course. How else could he do it?"
<p>
Vegeta threw back his head and laughed. "Idiot demon!  He fell short
of the mark! Cacodemon stopped his little time-trip a few months too
early, and killed me <i>before</i> his pet sorceror spat out his dying
curse! The fool--Bulma would never have gone looking for that wish and
found the Opawang if I hadn't died! CACODEMON AND HIS DAMNED SORCEROR
CAUSED THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION!"  Vegeta smiled very evilly. "For I
<i>will</i> destroy Cacodemon, I promise you that!"
<p>
The Ferryman's opalescent eyes opened a bit, and he grinned terribly,
showing tusks and sharp teeth. "So be it!"
<p>
Prince Vegeta smirked every so slightly. "Go, Ferryman! Take us to the
Time Before, and show me the way to Chaos!" Prince Vegeta clenched one
fist, and smiled grimly.
<p>
"Hang on, rough ride!" said the Ferryman, as he loosened the mooring
cable and sculled the boat into the current.  The current grabbed the
boat and shook it like a hungry crocodile shakes its prey, and then
flung the boat forward, shooting toward the waterfall's edge. Kadru
fled to the hold, to coil tightly about whatever beams she could find;
Modgudh grabbed the sternpost; Vegeta rode the bow, half-standing,
half-flying, laughing exultantly. The Ferryman merely braced the oar
against the current, forcing the boat on the course he desired, his
feet steady on the deck.
<p>
The black boat shot over the edge, seeming to hang in mid-air for an
instant, and dropped down, down, down into rushing darkness. They fell
with the water, and the water fell with them and on them, into an
infinity of darkness...

Something woke Goten. What was it? The little boy clutched his covers
close; he wished Mama hadn't moved Gohan out of his room. It made him
nervous, sometimes, to be alone.  Goten listened intently; he heard
something--a voice. A familiar voice, calling him from outside. He
crept over to the window and opened it.
<p>
"Daddy?  Is that you?" Goten answered softly.
<p>
"Yes, Goten; come quickly! Come outside right now, I need your
help--but don't tell Mama or she won't let you come!" answered Goku's
voice.
<p>
Goten thought a moment. "Okay" he answered, and started to climb out
the window. He dropped to the ground outside and looked around.
<p>
"Where are you, Daddy?  I can't see you."
<p>
"Right over here, behind the big tree. Come on, that's it.."
<p>
Goten thought he saw Daddy waving a hand at him and ran excitedly into
the woods.  He ran around the big tree and stopped short.
<p>
"You're not my daddy!"
<p>
"No, I'm not," answered the demon-dinosaur Scout, in Goku's voice.

<p>
Rough hands seized Pomona and Melchior and dragged them from the
shed. Pomona barely had time to notice the empty, merciless eyes of
their captors before she and Melchior were tossed into the back of a
pick-up truck. The hard metal bed bruised her side, and she groaned.
<p>
"Po? You okay?" Melchior was worried about her as usual, but never had
a complaint for himself. Pomona almost smiled; so typical of him! He
hadn't been thrown any more gently than she had.
<p>
"Just had the breath knocked out of me," she managed to gasp. "I think
we have bigger things to worry about," she added as the truck's engine
started.
<p>
The truck bounced down a rough gravel road, bruising and battering the
captives unmercifully as well as making conversation
impossible. Pomona couldn't see out from her current position, but she
could see up; and as the truck bounced downhill, turning back and
forth, she saw the walls of a quarry rise up around them.  We're going
down the service ramps into the quarry, she realized.  Finally, they
stopped, and she could hear chanting.. and screams.
<p>
"Did you see what happened to the other two?" Melchior asked
groggily. Blood trickled down his face where his head had struck the
side of the truck.
<p>
"Not sure, but I think there was a car waiting behind this truck.
Maybe it was for them?" Pomona shivered, trying not to think of their
own fate.
<p>
Before Melchior could answer, the empty-eyed men dragged them from the
truck, and carried them forward through the crowd in the pit of the
quarry. There were cheers as the two of them were lifted high, and
carried to the altar.
<p>
Pomona screamed when she saw what waited at the altar. Pomona
screamed, and the great shadowy form laughed, revealing sharp gleaming
teeth and incarnadine eyes. Then a familiar figure stepped forward
from the throng, eyes bright with a feverish light, long black hair
hanging down uncombed.
<p>
"Here are my offerings, O Keikan-Ma! May they find favor in your
eyes," Voron mocked a prayer.
<p>
The demon grinned. "They are strong; you have done well, sorceror.
Lord Dairi-Mao is pleased; stand forth to receive his blessing," he
hissed. As the shadow demon spoke, the sound of great wings flapping
echoed off the quarry walls, and something monstrous descended to the
altar. Deputy had come to initiate his followers.
<p>

<p>
Sinhika crouched above, watching. She had followed Enforcer to this
quarry-temple, followed and watched he and his human followers convene
this unholy ceremony. The descending levels of the pit quarry formed a
great natural amphitheatre, and Sinhika watched from the rim of the
next level up. Her lips were drawn back in a snarl.
<p>
"<i>Akaaryuum anishhtuum</i>! This.. atrocity is.. I cannot let this
continue! But.. I cannot fight even Keikan-Ma barehanded, and as for
that other <i>thing</i>..! Weapons. I need such weapons as my father and
uncle used of old--or failing that, sharp arrowheads and a well-honed
blade, endowed with my own power. Yes.. these beasts will practice
their rites until dawn; I will return before they can escape." She
rose, preparing to fly with all her speed back to the city--
<p>
"--those two at the altar, they are-- no! <i>Achintya</i>! This cannot be!
Pomona? Melchior? NOOOOOO!" She screamed soundlessly within the
illusion of silence.
<p>

<p>
Deputy reached out and touched Voron's bared chest with one dripping
talon; Voron gritted his teeth as the talon seared Deputy's mark into
his breast. "You are the first true initiate of Cacodemon in this
age, human! Rejoice in your honor and my favor; revel this night in
blood and pain!"
<p>
Deputy turned his mighty head toward Enforcer and grinned. "Summon my
broo!"
<p>
The smaller demon raised his hands, and the vortex began to form over
the altar. Melchior and Pomona sat with their backs to the altar,
bound hand and foot, and could see nothing of it, but the sudden
stirring of the evil throng told them something was happening.
Somehow, Melchior managed to brush Pomona's fingertips with his own.
<p>
"I think this is it, Po." he whispered.
<p>
Pomona smiled sadly, looking at her friend. "Been good to know you,
Melc."
<p>
Then they grabbed Melchior.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
In Hell, the broo sensed the opening chaos vortex; monsters raised their
heads and pricked their ears. Other denizens of the underworld also
noticed...
<p>
"Sir! Look, there!" Negi pointed down into one of the more open
canyons of the Pit of Worms. "Can you feel it? It's another one of
those disturbances! This is the first time we've actually been able to
<i>see</i> what happens!" the Saiyan warrior told his commander.
<p>
Commander Kale nodded, intent on the scene below. In the canyon, a
darkness churned and swirled and howled, twisting all vision around
it.  Monstrous things clustered thickly about it; small animal-headed
broo and larger things, less identifiable, with tails and tentacles
and too many legs and extra heads and other deformations. The crowd of
monsters trembled in anticipation.
<p>
"Look, there's some of the big boys," Negi whispered to Commander
Kale. "See that house-sized monster with the mirror scales? That's the
'Captain of Ragnaglar'--he seems to be the leader of this bunch. The
ram-headed one with the tentacle sprouting from his hip and the extra
face on his chest is Howler--very aggressive, tends to attack
stupidly, but he always brings along enough fellow idiots to cover his
retreat. That.. thing.. that looks like a giant polyp with two
tentacle-arms is another sub-leader--I have no idea what they call it,
but it's got a lot of power." He turned to his commander. "Now that
they're gathering here, shall we attack?"
<p>
"Not yet. I need to know exactly happens with one of these
'disturbances'." Kale gestured with one white-gloved hand at the scene
below. "Hold off until whatever is happening has finished. Be ready
for my word."
<p>
Suddenly the howling note rose to a piercing shriek, and the dark
vortex froze, deepened into absolute blackness. A figure seem to hang
suspended in that blackness. The Captain of Ragnaglar leaned forward,
sniffed disdainfully, and turned away, disappearing into the twisted
canyons. One by one the subleaders also examined the vortex, and
turned away, disappointment and disdain plain in their expressions and
the set of their bodies.
<p>
The smaller broo howled and surged forward, stronger ones smashing and
biting and clawing their way past or through the weaker ones. Finally
one surged ahead of the pack and flung himself into the vortex. There
was a flare of light, and a human form fell to the ground amid the
struggling pack.  Negi caught a glimpse of green hair before he
disappeared under the crowd of broo.
<p>
"Now! Attack!" ordered Commander Kale.
<p>
"You heard him, you slugs! ATTACK!" Negi yelled to the rest of the
squad as he leaped down, landing near one edge of the chaotic
pack. Even as his blade sliced one goat head from its owner's
shoulders, another dark vortex began to form...
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Pomona gasped as something with many coppery legs landed lightly
beside her, straddling the altar. It scuttled aside as the smaller
shadow demon growled some command to it.  Rough hands grabbed her by
the feet and shoulders, hoisting her up to rest on the blood-soaked
altar.
<p>
"Sorceror Voron," hissed the great winged monster called Lord
Dairi-Mao, "you have power now--use it, as you have been taught, and
summon my broo yourself!"
<p>
Voron bowed, smirking. "With pleasure, Great Lord."  He flung his arms
wide and began to chant the ritual, focussing his power on this new
task. To one side, a ram-headed broo with the lower body of a giant
copper-scaled scorpion watched intently. Pomona shuddered as she
caught sight of the distinctive earrings hanging from both ears;
earrings last seen on Melchior's ears.
<p>
At last the void yawned, moaning. Pomona turned her head away, only to
see the secondary altars set up among the frenzied crowd. She
squinted; what was that on the one nearest her? Then she realized what
she was seeing, and what they were doing to the young girl tied
there...
<p>
At Pomona's brief cry, Voron looked down. "Oh, don't worry--we won't
be doing that with <i>you</i>! You're much too powerful to waste in mere
entertainment. You're just going to die and go to Hell and have your
soul eaten by chaos spirits." Voron grinned mockingly. "Throw her in!"
<p>
Pomona struggled desperately, nearly breaking free of the hands
holding her, but to no avail. She screamed as she was flung into the
void--
<p>
--a terrible wrenching agony, as if her very flesh and bone were being
turned inside out, a feeling of a vile presense inside her, and then
separation. The sensation of being ripped away from herself, and flung
into darkness. Then--
<p>

<p>
Back at Capsule Corporation, Sinhika flung open the door to the main
machine shop. Dr. Briefs and one of his technicians looked up from
their work, startled.
<p>
"Dr. Briefs," asked the orange-haired Indian girl wearing a hardhat,
"do you have some leaf springs, two meters of #12 steel cable, and
about three dozen steel rods I could use?"
<p>
"There should be some in the metal shop supply room," he answered
absently, already back to considering the problem before him.
<p>
"Thank you.  You're not using the metal lathe or the electric forge
right now, are you?"
<p>
"No, not right now.. What are you working on? We're working on the
city's power problem," Dr. Briefs looked concerned.
<p>
"I need to make some weapons to kill two large demons--don't worry, I
know how to operate the equipment and I have my goggles."  Sinhika
brandished a set of welder's goggles.
<p>
"Oh, that's fine. That won't interfere with my broadcast power
generator. Be careful with that equipment; I wouldn't want you to get
hurt."
<p>
"Thank you, Dr. Briefs," Sinhika called over her shoulder as she
disappeared into the metal shop.
<p>

<p>
Over at Bulma's house, Raditz watched Nezumi impatiently. "What do you
think you're doing?  How is this going to help us find Bulma and
Trunks? If something happens to them while you're wasting time--" He
snarled and clenched one white-gauntletted fist.
<p>
Nezumi glanced up from the dirt she was examining. "Do you already
know where they are? If you do, how am I stopping you from rescuing
them right now?" She looked at him, pert and falsely innocent.
<p>
Raditz, dressed in the black and white armor that Bulma had developed,
folded his arms and scowled. "No, I don't know where they are!" He
fiddled with the slim black scouter attached to his right ear. "I
can't even pick up Bulma on this stupid thing, and I know I stored her
energy signature when we started calibration."
<p>
"So she's out of range?" Nezumi continued working, snapping quick
pictures of the footprints and taking samples.
<p>
"Or dead. Or masked somehow.  The demons didn't show up on the scouter
at all, nor could I sense them.  Maybe they have some way of hiding
things from both artificial and natural senses." Raditz paced, still
scowling.
<p>
"You're really worried about them, aren't you?" Nezumi looked at him,
startled, then thoughtful. "You're not nearly as heartless as you
acted this afternoon!"
<p>
Raditz scowled at her. "It's my <i>duty</i> to protect them! I've already
failed in my duty, and if anything worse happens to them.."
<p>
"As you say, Raditz-san," Nezumi bent her head down to look at her
work, hiding a smile. A few minutes later she frowned thoughtfully.
Nezumi pushed the magnifier up on to her forehead. "There's something
very odd about these footprints. Not the shape--basic size ten
workboots, but what was tracked in and left on the rug--that was
odd. I would have expected tar, or maybe mud, but this is some kind of
white sand or rock dust. In fact--" she picked up a few grains of the
sand with tweezers and dropped it into a test tube from her kit. It
bubbled and boiled. "--it's marble dust."
<p>
She pursed her lips and stared at Raditz. "Where do you find marble
dust around here? Answer that question, and we just might find Bulma
and Trunks!"
<p>

<p>
Darkness absolute enveloped him, darkness and silence unbroken. It was
like nothing he had ever known--complete nothingness. He could see
nothing, hear nothing, feel nothing, only unending darkness and
silence and emptiness. There was no ground beneath him; if he was
falling, he could not feel it.
<p>
No power of his could make light in this place--if place it
was. Strain as he might, he could see nothing but blackness. Did he
still have eyes? He was a spirit--did he still have that false
semblance of a body that the Hells had granted him? Did he have ears,
and if he did, was there anything to hear? Neither the dead heart that
rested unbeating in his breast, nor the stillness of his empty lungs
could break the silence within and without.
<p>
He could feel nothing, not ground, not falling, not pain, not even
himself. No sensation of power tickled his mind, not his own or any
other's. Only empty, silent darkness, forever and ever.
<p>
It seemed that he'd been drifting in the darkness forever; even the
memory of light faded. Did he even exist? Perhaps he'd found only
Oblivion beyond the borders of Time. Who was he?
<p>
I am.. Vegeta, Prince of the Saiyajin! Why did he cling to that name,
that title? It was meaningless, as empty as this place. The Vegeta
dynasty was ended, their world destroyed, their subjects dead. Prince
of Nothing. The Saiyajin were dead and damned, forgotten except as a
vague legend of destruction and evil.
<p>
Not all dead. Not all! Kakarott.. Once his enemy, his rival, sometimes
his ally; soft-hearted fool, and yet.. brilliant in combat, worthy of
his prince's trust--even if he didn't acknowledge his own prince.. far
too lenient with his enemies.. but Vegeta himself had lived, had found
a life he never dreamed of because of that lenience.
<p>
Or had it been lenience?  He had seen that glint in Kakarott's eyes
when they fought their first, magnificent battle; oh yes, Kakarott had
revelled in that combat as much as his prince had! Both of them,
pushed to their absolute limits and beyond, to--stalemate. Neither of
them had truly won, though Vegeta had been forced to retreat; both of
them too brutally injured to truly say "I defeated my enemy!" Vegeta
knew why Kakarott let him escape Kulilin's vengeance; like Vegeta, he
knew they must fight again! It was destiny...
<p>
..A destiny which had eluded him. The last, worst blow had been
Kakarott's death fighting Cell, a death from which there would be no
return--or so he'd thought. Never to face Kakarott again--for Vegeta
knew himself well enough to know that his final destination would NOT
be the same as Kakarott's-- never to finally know which of them was
the strongest, that was bitter, perhaps even more bitter than his
humiliation at Frieza's hands.
<p>
It was more bitter; at least when Frieza killed him, Vegeta had taken
with him into the darkness the faint hope that Kakarott--a
Saiyan!--would avenge him. Kakarott had then done the impossible, and
reached the Super-Saiyan in spite of his soft heart (and occasionally
soft head), reached the Super-Saiyan and defeated Frieza. Of course
the idiot was then lenient and spared Frieza when he should have
finished the alien despot--but his son Trunks had completed the
vengeance of the Saiyajin.  Yes, that had been sweet! His son avenged
both his father's and his grandfather's murders; and Kakarott had, in
his way, avenged his own father.
<p>
Kakarott's lenience had an annoying habit of fulfilling destinies.. If
he had let Kulilin kill me, I would not have been on Namek to save
Gohan and that same idiot who wanted to kill me from the Ginyu
Force--and Frieza. Did you ever know how close your son came to dying,
Kakarott?  Frieza picked your son as his first victim, and only I was
fast enough to save Gohan!
<p>
I still suspect you had something to do with the wish that resurrected
the Nameks--and myself. Lenient again, Kakarott?  You could have
worded that wish in such a way as to leave me rotting in my grave. You
did not, and I lived.. and had a son. A son without whom you and your
whole world was doomed. Hah!
<p>
No words of mine will ever change you, Kakarott. You are destined to
be.. lenient, and whatever else you are. It is my destiny to be what I
am, and it is <i>our</i> destiny to finally face each other in combat, and
learn which of us is the stronger. Did you understand the joy that
flashed through me at the sight of you, somehow restored to life and
facing that monster?  Did you know how much I exulted in the knowledge
that we would finally face each other, after that monstrous demon was
dead?
<p>
Then Cacodemon killed <i>me</i>. <i>I</i> was the one dead without hope of
return, gone to a realm that Kakarott would never know! It is almost
as if.. as if it is <i>not</i> our destiny to face each other again!
Always, when I have come close to facing you, Kakarott, something has
intervened--death, marooning in space, monsters trying to destroy the
world. Always something!
<p>
This time, I shall return, and you <i>will</i> survive the next battle--I
will not permit any other possibility. And then, we <i>will</i> face each
other, and I <i>will</i> defeat you, Kakarott! It will be a magnificent
battle-- perhaps I won't even kill you. It would be so much more
satisfying to humble you, to see you bow before me and acknowledge me
as your prince and your better--far more satisfying than standing over
your empty-eyed corpse!
<p>
Yes, at least there was Kakarott. And if he'd understood Kakarott
truly, Raditz lived as well. Raditz! At least he acknowledged Vegeta
as his prince. At least that--Vegeta had always thought him weak, and
frequently a fool. Hell seemed to have cured him of being a fool, and
perhaps Earth would cure him of being weak.  If he was anything like
his brother, father and nephews, Raditz had hidden potential. Who knew
what he might become, in time?
<p>
Prince of a kingdom of two subjects. Not much more than nothing, was
it?  Ah, but the Prince had a consort.. Bulma, blue-haired, beautiful,
bold, as fiesty as any Saiyan woman--more so, for the Vegeta kings had
been too strong and too feared for any woman to defy them to their
faces. Bulma never feared to defy him when she was angry. He loved her
for it, he was proud that his princess loved to fight him--even though
she could not fight him physically. He could fight her way, too. He'd
learned to fight with words during the long, bitter years under
Frieza, when he dared not openly rebel against Frieza and his lackeys.
<p>
There were so many things that he.. loved her for. Ah, curse this!
Even alone, in infinite darkness, it was so hard to admit even to
himself what he felt.. or even that he felt. So many, many years of
teaching himself not to feel anything, and to hide what he did happen
to feel.
<p>
First, he'd been taught that a Prince or King must avoid any
attachments, any vulnerabilities that could be used by this faction or
that against him, or that could distort his judgement from what must
be done.
<p>
I thought I saw in my father's murder and the murder of our world the
vindication of that teaching--for he had made the 'mistake' of caring
about <i>me</i>. A strange 'mistake', for in the normal course of things I
would have killed him for the throne when I was ready--but now that I
have a son, I begin to understand.
<p>
And under Frieza--how much less did he dare to show any favor to
anyone! Frieza's cruel humor delighted in mental torment.  Grief and
despair entertained that fiend well; there was nothing Frieza liked
better than destroying hope.  To show any trace of affection for
anyone other than Frieza was to doom the unfortunate you cared
about. Sometimes I think that bastard was actually jealous of his
lackey's affections!
<p>
Not that I liked any of Frieza's other lackeys; I loathed them all!
Well, there was one old doctor who was always respectful, even
concerned--he'd been on Vegetasai before it was destroyed, and
actually <i>liked</i> Saiyajin! I wonder if he survived? He was alive the
last time I saw him, but that was long ago. As I remember, his race is
quite long-lived...
<p>
No matter; I'm not likely to see him again! I cared only about my own
people, Nappa and Raditz, and dared not show that they were anything
more than loyal lackeys. In truth, I didn't see Raditz as much more
than that, and he never pretended to anything more. Nappa.. was much
more. He trained me, all but raised me, taught me of the traditions,
and never failed to remind me that I was the Prince of the Saiyajin. I
trained myself to never show my true feelings in front of anyone, but
always treated Nappa with contempt--for all eyes and ears reported
back to Frieza, and we were constantly monitored.
<p>
Too long; too many years of pretended contempt at Nappa's short temper
and lack of tact, too many years of pretended contempt for his
stupidity and impatience, and the pretense became real. That was
Frieza's real victory over me; I became what I pretended to be--a
cruel beast without any feelings except hate and anger.
<p>
When did that change? It had to have been Namek--I went through so
much on Namek. For the first time in years, I had real hope in my
quest--the dragonballs! It would have been insanity to trust to a
vague legend, save for one thing: Kakarott died fighting Raditz. He
<i>died</i>, and returned to life to face me. It was impossible! It was real.
<p>
I had hope; more hope after I handily defeated Frieza's lackeys--Kiwi,
Doddoria, finally Zarbon. I had all the dragonballs at last--so I
thought; I was pleased, even joyous in anticipation of my victory, an
emotion I had not felt since.. since the fall of Vegetasai. I was so
pleased that I was.. lenient. Lenient to that bald idiot, lenient to
Bulma, lenient to Kakarott's brat--so I thought of him then.
<p>
I had only contempt for the boy's cowardice during their fight with
Nappa--no true Saiyan child would have whimpered and run like
that--yet at the end Gohan surprised me, finding courage in anger and
striking back at Nappa with unbelievable power.
<p>
He surprised me again, on Namek, coming out to face me when for all he
knew I was ready to strike him dead that instant!  I saw it in his
eyes: the boy was afraid, but he faced me, defied me! I knew then that
Raditz had been right--Kakarott's son was a true Saiyan! And more.. he
was the first Saiyan I had seen since I returned from Earth, alone,
the last of my race. Not the last--not any more! It didn't matter that
he was the son of my enemy--he was a Saiyan child, alone on a world
occupied by the mortal enemy of the Saiyajin, and I was the Prince of
all Saiyajin!
<p>
It was as simple as that. I wondered that I hadn't seen it before;
Gohan was a Saiyan child who needed my protection, and it was my duty
as Prince to protect him. Or was it merely duty?  Sometimes I suspect
that I actually.. <i>like</i> the brat!
<p>
Kakarott.. Gohan.. Bulma.. Trunks.. Yes.. my son, whom I first met as
a grown man and warrior--and I did not even know him! Or did I?  From
the beginning, there was something disturbingly familiar about him. I
must have been blind not to see that he had my face and my will--and
his mother's ridiculous hair. Not that it is ridiculous on
Bulma--never that!
<p>
I never did tell her that blue was a favored color among Saiyan women;
there were many who dyed their hair that shade. It had a
certain.. symbolism.  Perhaps I should tell Bulma what it symbolizes
some day...
<p>
Day. I can only remember that when I remember <i>them</i>; I remember how
they looked under Earth's sun, or Namek's three stars. I can see
Kakarott under the darkened sky of Namek, radiant in his own glory,
the first Super-Saiyan in a thousand years! Ah, what a sight that was,
to greet me upon my resurrection! Amid the ashes of my broken pride,
dying with one last faint hope -- a hope so gloriously fulfilled!
<p>
Kakarott.. there are between us bonds of battle, life and death. You
have not feared me since we fought on Earth.. because you know me
better than I know myself. Unlike all the others, you know the
difference between what I say from pride, and what is in my
heart. And I, I have come to know what you are, Kakarott, and what is
in your heart.
<p>
Do you know what is in my heart, Kakarott? You know my pride, and you
know how I love battle, and I think you know what lies between
us.. but do you know the rest of it?  Did you ever suspect that I
protected your son on Namek, or why?  Did you have the least idea how
I felt about your "oldest friend" Bulma?  Perhaps.. I look back, and
you were the only one who could even comprehend the bond between Bulma
and I.. a bond <i>she</i> knew existed long before I did!  Well, perhaps
not all <i>that</i> long.. Heh.
<p>
Vegeta remembered a certain moment in the shower, and Bulma's loud
objection that she was NOT his "servant woman". He chuckled to
himself, and the very darkness drew back, as if startled--as if
laughter was an alien thing. It was still black, but now Vegeta
thought he could feel air rushing past his face, as if he were
falling.
<p>
How had he gotten here, wherever "here" was? Vegeta remembered
standing on the bow, riding the ship down the falls; plunging
vertically into the abyss, Vegeta half-flying with it. The ship, and
Vegeta, struck.. something. The darkness became thick, viscous,
slowing the ship's fall and Vegeta's too.  The force of it pulled
Vegeta from the ship--he'd only been touching it lightly, flying with
it rather than riding it. He'd watched in dismay as the ship plunged
down past him, Modgudh still clinging tightly to the sternpost, the
Ferryman gripping the steering oar, leaving Vegeta behind, caught in
thick darkness like a fly in a spider's web.
<p>
How long he'd been caught in that darkness, he did not know; nor was
Prince Vegeta sure that time even had meaning here. How long had he
been falling, and would it ever stop? Perhaps he was caught in an--
<p>
CRUNCH! THUD! Vegeta hit bottom, his body bouncing from the impact, to
fall again, nearly every bone in his body shattered. Pain ripped
through him; neither unconsciousness nor shock intervened, for the
damned have not those comforts.  Sheer will alone held Vegeta
together; only unstoppable determination kept him from drifting away
as a broken wisp of spirit.
<p>
One.. last.. peach.  Without thinking, Vegeta tried to reach into his
armor with his one good hand and pull it out.
<p>
"ARGGGHHH!" Collarbones broken in several places, and snapped and
splintered arms left the Saiyan Prince helpless. I'll have to wait for
it to heal, at least a little bit. And Vegeta waited unmoving, broken
and bleeding, in the place where Time has no meaning, and forever is
now.

<CENTER><P>CONTINUED IN CHAPTER XXIII. AKAARYUM</P></CENTER>

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="AK">XXIII. AKAARYUM</A></H1>
<p>
A murky red-orange light dimly lit the canyon floor, revealing broken
rocks and pools of slime--and about a dozen goat-headed demons
crowding close.  Pomona staggered to her feet--and shrieked as
something touched her from behind.
<p>
"Easy, Po. It's me." Melchior stood at her shoulder, a wry smile on
his plain face. "My parents always warned me I'd end up here.." He
sighed.
<p>
"Here? What happened, anyway? Are we...?"  Pomona stooped and pulled a
knife from her boot; three of the goat-demons hissed at her; the
others seemed to be looking anxiously over their shoulders.
<p>
Melchior nodded. "I think so."
<p>
A goat-demon reached for Pomona; the pink-haired girl slashed at it
with the knife, and it pulled its hand back hurriedly. "Uh, Melc, any
idea what these things want, or how we can get them to go away?"
<p>
"I dunno; they're not talking to me. I don't think it's good."
Earrings glittered in the light as he turned his head this way and
that, watching the goat-demons in front of him. "They can be hurt."
Pomona finally noticed that one of the goat-demons was sprawled at his
feet, unmoving. "I wish I had a real weapon, though."
<p>
"HAI!" A shout from somewhere in the murk, and something came flashing
down toward them. Melchior grabbed it reflexively, and found himself
holding a katana.
<p>
"'Ask and ye shall receive..' All right!" The green-haired lad gripped
the sword with both hands and slashed the nearest goat-demon. It fell
back, guts spilling onto the ground. Another growled and rushed him,
only to lose its throat. Something whined and exploded in the
distance, and several of the goat-demons turned and bolted into the
fog.
<p>
"Forget these two," snarled another goat-demon. "Saiyajin coming!"
The remaining goat-demons froze, sniffing the air and listening. As
one, they turned and ran.
<p>
Pomona turned to look at Melchior and the carnage he'd wrought. "Damn!
Where'd you learn to fight like that? I thought you were a pacifist!"
<p>
"Tae Kwan Do, a little Kendo. Everyone's got to have a hobby."
Melchior shrugged, looking slightly embarassed. "I don't like
fighting, but I don't care to be a punching bag, either".
<p>
Pomona raised one eyebrow. "Geez, you think you know your friends, and
they're still full of surprises. Now what?"
<p>
A tall figure dropped silently out of the mist to the canyon floor in
front of them. "Now, you come with us."
<p>
Pomona stared at the figure in front of her--a man in some antique
armor with long, unruly black hair tumbling down his back; a long scar
crossed his face and perhaps accounted for the eyepatch worn over one
eye; and a furry brown belt was wrapped snuggly around his
waist. There was something vaguely familiar about the man's look--she
knew she'd seen someone like him before.
<p>
"Who are you, and why are we going with you?" Melchior asked, one
eyebrow raised.
<p>
"I'm the warrior who owns that sword you're holding. For a weakling
human who doesn't like to fight," the tailed warrior sneered
contemptuously, "you do some damage," he allowed grudgingly, glancing
at the fallen broo. "You should have finished them, though."
<p>
The tailed warrior held out one hand; glowing energy gathered around
it and surged forward in a beam to strike the sprawled bodies,
incinerating them. Wisps of broken spirit seeped away. "You only hurt
them; they would have recovered."
<p>
"Oh. Well, they looked dead to me!" Melchior shrugged, and presented
the hilt of the katana to the strange warrior. "Thanks for the blade."
<p>
"Don't thank me, human! It was only an accident that it wound up in
your hands!" the Saiyan glowered, strangely embarassed. He took the
katana back, and sheathed it. "I am Negi. You're coming with me
because I've been ordered to take you two back to report to the king."
<p>
"That almost makes sense," noted Melchior. "What king, and what
kingdom is this?"
<p>
Negi scowled. "King Vegeta, Duke Infernal of the Hell of Evil
Warriors--which is where you are. You don't belong here, so somebody a
whole lot higher up than me has to sort this damn mess out! Now get
moving!" the dead Saiyan snarled.
<p>
"I'm moving, I'm moving!" Melchior set off in the indicated
direction. With a shrug, Pomona followed him.
<p>
"You know something, Melc?" she asked her green-haired friend.
<p>
"What, Po?" Melchior concentrated on hauling himself up the steep
trail that Negi bounced up like a mountain goat.
<p>
"It's such a relief to know that we don't belong here.."

<p>
Goku materialized just outside Bulma's house; he was about to go
inside, when he sensed another, familiar presence.  Piccolo! He flew
up, and found the Namek warrior hovering high above, watching.
<p>
"Hey, Piccolo! Have you found them? What's Raditz doing?"
<p>
"No, I can't sense them nearby; as for your brother---" Piccolo broke
off abruptly, and turned his head toward the east.
<p>
"Ahhh! It's back!" Goku gasped.
<p>
"You've sensed it as well?" Piccolo asked abruptly.
<p>
"Yes, for months. It comes, and disappears again before I can find
it." Goku frowned.  "It's evil, and incredibly powerful.. like the
demon that killed Vegeta."
<p>
"It's not disappearing so fast this time!" Piccolo snarled. "I heard
the demon called Deputy boast of his plans to Raditz; Vegeta's death,
the attack on Raditz, Bulma and Trunks kidnapping--they all go
together, Son. This.. evil.. reappearing now is no coincidence."
<p>
Goku nodded. "There's no time to waste; it could vanish at any moment!
Let's go!"  Power flared as Goku plunged eastward through the sky. A
heartbeat later, Piccolo caught up with him, and paced him as they
flew.

<p>
"..the rift vortex these demons create requires a soul of close to the
same power to make the exchange. It might be possible to stop the
exchange by stopping the broo from entering the vortex on this side,
sire."  Once again, Commander Kale knelt before his king, and brought
the Saiyan monarch less-than-welcome news.
<p>
King Vegeta frowned. "Then why didn't you stop the exchange??" he
snapped.
<p>
Kale swallowed quickly. "It also might blow the rift wide open,
sire--and I lack the power to close an open rift."
<p>
The auburn-haired king glared at the white-cloaked commander kneeling
before him, and then turned his head to glare at the red-cloaked
warrior standing beside him.
<p>
"That means I send you, Bardock," King Vegeta growled to the
scar-faced warrior who greatly resembled Kakarott. "Get your team, and
deal with these damn broo and their rifts--now!  Dismissed!"
<p>
"Sire!" Bardock knelt and saluted, and then left quickly, his red cape
swirling behind him.
<p>
After Bardock's departure, the dead king turned back to the rest of
his court.  His gaze flicked up and down the line of bull-headed
demons--Gozu Oni--standing guard, and came to rest on their Captain.
<p>
"Nappa, prepare to--"
<p>
--Reality strained, twisted, and finally gave way--
<p>
"--WHAT IN ALL THE HELLS IS THAT?" King Vegeta jumped to his feet,
staring at the shimmering void that had appeared in the air near the
ceiling. It looked like a rectangular pool of black water, standing on
edge; it reflected the light in shimmering waves, but revealed nothing
of itself.
<p>
Commander Kale swallowed again. "It's a rift, sire," he heard himself
saying.
<p>
King Vegeta glared at the hapless warrior; his arm trembled and energy
glowed around his hand.  "Don't tell me the obvious, Commander! Since
<i>you</i> are here, take your team and find out where that damn thing
goes--and make sure whatever opened it doesn't ever do it again! Don't
bother coming back until you do! Now, get out of my sight!"
<p>
"Yes, sire!" Kale bowed and retreated with as much speed as dignity
allowed.
<p>
The king turned back to the Captain of the Gozu-Oni. "Nappa--"
<p>
The doors that had just swung shut behind Kale re-opened, and Kosho,
King Vegeta's chamberlain, entered.
<p>
"NOW WHAT?" King Vegeta snarled.
<p>
"Sire," announced his chamberlain, a black-bearded Saiyan of average
height, "Prince Indrajit of the Rakshasas requests an audience with
you.."  Kosho paused, and then continued in a slightly surprised tone,
"He says he's here on behalf of Prince Vegeta."
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Prince Vegeta waited, broken in the darkness. He remembered--all he
could do was remember, now.  He did not care to remember the bitter
years under Freeza--let them be forgotten. Before that.. his father,
Nappa, the elite warriors of Vegetasai--also bitterness to
remember. All gone.. Though their souls still lived, in the Hells, the
world that had been home was gone forever. Only his newest home,
Earth, still lived--and this demon of Chaos meant to destroy that,
too! Rage seared through Vegeta; for all his promises and will, he was
helpless, a broken thing lost in darkness!
<p>
There must be some way.. what had Kakarott done when he lay, broken
and helpless? Others had helped him. Help from others.. something
Vegeta had always disdained--it meant he was weak, that he could not
do for himself.  Well, he <i>was</i> weak now, he could not do for himself
what <i>must</i> be done. It was not the first time--but his pride would
never let him admit to others that he'd really needed help.. Only
once, when he was dying at Freeza's feet, had he admitted his need to
Kakarott. Only once.. but there had been other times. That son of
Kakarott's seemed to have a talent for.. rescuing Vegeta, though
Vegeta had never thanked him for it.. Gratitude would have been an
admission of weakness, of needing help.
<p>
Now.. he needed help. And there was no one to ask..
<p>
*No one?*
<p>
Vegeta started; what was that? A presence, dimly felt..
<p>
"Who's there?"
<p>
As if in answer, something warm enfolded him, warming him and taking
away the agony of his broken bones. He could feel bones shift and set,
knitting together; torn muscles reattached themselves; wounds closed.
<p>
"Who are you?" Vegeta asked.
<p>
*Solace-In-Darkness*
<p>
"Why did you heal me?"
<p>
*That is my nature*
<p>
Prince Vegeta scrambled to his feet, and flexed his hands--or rather,
one hand. The other hand was still cold and paralyzed.  "Can you heal
my left hand?"
<p>
*No. It is not injured*
<p>
"WHAT??" Vegeta's eyes opened wide in astonishment, though he still
could not see anything. "Then why can't I use it?"
<p>
*You don't know how to use it*
<p>
"That's ridic--" Vegeta stopped abruptly; eyes narrowing. Perhaps this
being knew what he--no, <i>she</i>--was talking about? "How do I use it?"
<p>
*Your hand knows how to use itself; trust yourself*
<p>
"Answer the question!"
<p>
*I cannot*
<p>
"Or will not? Never mind. Answer another question--how do I find the
Chaos Hells, and Cacodemon's lair?"
<p>
*You cannot. You are trapped within the Chambers of Subere, the
darkness that has never known Light*
<p>
Cold sweat beaded Vegeta's forehead. This was not good! If he could
not escape.. Wait! Something in the dark being's words.. But he'd have
to <i>ask</i> for help again! This was impossible! He was the Prince of the
Saiyajin, he didn't <i>ask</i> for anyone's help!
<p>
But, he was Prince of the Saiyajin; he was responsible for his
subjects: all five or six of them--and the blue world he claimed as
his own. The stakes were too high; even the king did not go into
battle alone and unaided.
<p>
"<i>I</i> cannot, you say. Can <i>you</i> guide me out of this darkness?"
<p>
*Yes*  The warm darkness enfolded him in its--no, <i>her</i>--arms again,
and took him away.

<p>
"Goten?" Raditz froze abruptly; sweat broke out on his forehead.
<p>
"Hmmm?" Nezumi looked up from her list of marble and decorative rock
dealers, monument makers, and similar businesses that dealt in marble.
Red marks adorned the map of Satan City she'd taped to the conference
room table.
<p>
"Something's wrong with Goten.. I felt him start to call for help,
then nothing." He looked at Nezumi, eyes wide. "I can't sense him at
all!"
<p>
"Uhmm, maybe he's too far away? You said you couldn't sense Bulma
because she's so weak, and your nephew is just a little boy.."
<p>
"I can <i>always</i> sense Goten, no matter where he is!" Raditz
growled. "I told them the demon was after him, too! WHY DIDN'T ANYONE
LISTEN??"
<p>
Nezumi winced. "HEY! Don't yell at me, I didn't do it!" Sensing his
urgency, she folded up her map and list.
<p>
"Come on!" Raditz grabbed her by the arm and half-dragged her out the
door as she stumbled along, trying to keep up.
<p>
"Where--"
<p>
"My brother's house--that's where Goten is or was. Whatever's wrong
has to do with what took Bulma and Trunks. Hang on!" Raditz grabbed
Nezumi under her arms and wrapped his tail around her waist.
<p>
"WHAA--!!" Nezumi felt like her stomach was left a couple thousand
feet below as they rocketed straight up and over, heading toward the
waning moon.

"Watch yourself, Son Goku! It's coming straight at you!"  Piccolo
hovered above the swampy ruins of the Eastern Capital; below him the
mud boiled as something burst from the mire.
<p>
"I see it!" Goku yelled. "It's horrible--I haven't felt anything this
evil before! It has nothing but evil ki--and it's huge!" As the thing
rose from below, he transformed, his hair blazing golden, eyes turned
to glowing turquoise. The energy of his transformation crackled and
seethed around him.
<p>
It was half the size of an ouzaru, covered with glowing red
fur; monstrous bat-like wings flapped with an unnatural slowness as
the thing ascended to meet them. A face like a giant bat's turned
toward them; tentacles writhed and fused and split again all around
its mouth.  It screamed.
<p>
Piccolo put his hands to his head and groaned as the harsh scream
pierced his ears, bringing pain undreamed of. Blood ran from Piccolo's
ears, nose and mouth. Goku also shook his head from side to side, as
if clearing his ears; there was a puzzled look on his face.
<p>
"..." he said, and then realized he could hear nothing. Piccolo pointed
at his ears and shook his head; they were both deaf. Goku pointed at
the monster.
<p>
"......!" Piccolo shouted as he hurled a tremondous energy beam
straight into the creature's face. It dodged, but not quite fast
enough; one wing was holed.
<p>
It snarled soundlessly, and twin rays of ruby light shot from its eyes
toward the green alien. Piccolo dodged. The fight was on.
<p>

<p>
"My lords," Voron bowed to the two chaos demons that he knew as
Keikan-Ma and Dairi-Mao, "all is in readiness. Einak and Rabnai know
their tasks and are eager to begin," the chaos sorceror indicated the
two broo who had been successfully summoned with the sacrifice of
Pomona and Melchior.  He continued, "My assistant Caleb tells me he
will soon capture another human with power, and your two special
victims are at hand, and starting to recover consciousness. They are
ready for your pleasures."  The young man smirked.
<p>
Deputy nodded his huge dog-like head. "Enforcer, I am pleased with
you; you have chosen well with this one." The great demon rocked back
on his tail.
<p>
&lt;Enforcer, get things started! Sooner or later our enemies will
recover their senses and get organized--let there be a suitable reward
for them when they finally do!&gt;
<p>
&lt;Yes, Great Deputy!&gt; The shadow demon hissed an order to his
followers, and they hastened to obey.  The wicked throng fell silent
as the unconscious bodies of a blue-haired woman and a lavendar-haired
boy were carried to the altar, and tied upright to wooden frames, one
to either side of the altar, facing each other.
<p>
"Use chains for the child, you fool, not rope!" Voron snapped, and two
cultists scurried quickly to obey.
<p>
Deputy's eyes widened suddenly, and he giggled with
pleasure. &lt;Enforcer, prepare for another! Scout has finally
accomplished something--he has the child Goten for us! He comes even
now.&gt;
<p>
&lt;It shall be done, Great Deputy!&gt; Enforcer summoned Voron to him, and
snarled his orders; Voron bowed low, and gathered some more of the
cultists, and set them about the needed tasks.
<p>
"Wake them," Enforcer growled.
<p>
Splash! Bulma woke up sputtering; someone had just dashed a bucket of
cold water in her face. Her head hurt abominably, and her arms ached;
she tried to shift her position, and realized that she couldn't
move--her arms were tied in place.
<p>
"WHAT DID YOU DO.. that.. for?" As Bulma opened her eyes, the first
thing she saw was Trunks, chained to a heavy wooden frame on the other
side of a blood-stained block of marble. He, too, was soaked with cold
water and sputtering awake.  Next to him crouched a monster--a
ram-headed demon with horns of brass or gold, and brassy, wiry fur
covering its body.
<p>
Bulma looked quickly around; a crowd of very nasty looking people,
another monster next to her--this one a sort of goat-headed scorpion
centaur with copper plates instead of chitin--another monster like a
nine-foot shadow with sharp teeth standing behind the altar, and
perched on the rocks behind him--!
<p>
"EEEEEEEEEE!" Bulma screamed at the sight of Deputy crouching above
her.
<p>
Deputy giggled.  "I killed Raditz; his blood tasted good." Deputy
flicked out his long, barbed tongue and licked his lips with
exaggerated slowness. "I promised my broo they could play with you and
Trunks for a while." Deputy giggled again, then stared hard at Enforcer.
<p>
"Strip them!" the shadow demon commanded.
<p>
Two of Voron's picked men reached up to rip away Bulma's clothing--
<p>
THWACK! THWACK! Each man stopped abruptly, and collapsed to the
ground, a steel arrow protruding from his chest. THWACK-THWACK! Two
men approaching Trunks fell.
<p>
"Cacodemon! NOT NOW!" Deputy's head snapped up and he howled
angrily. Powerful legs bent as he crouched and sprang into the air,
great wings flapping.
<p>
TH-CHING! An arrow glanced off of Einak's copper plates; SHUNK!
Another arrow missed Rabnai and embedded itself in the wooden frame as
the brass-horned broo dove to one side.
<p>
&lt;ENFORCER! DEAL WITH THIS!&gt; Deputy bellowed to his demon servant over
their mindlink. &lt;I have another problem to solve!&gt;
<p>
"YEAH!" Bulma yelled. "I think we've got a friend out there!" she
shouted to Trunks.
<p>
"MOM! ARE YOU OKAY??" the boy shouted, tugging at his chains.
<p>
"DO I LOOK OKAY TO YOU??" Bulma tugged futilely at her ropes.
<p>
SHOOOM! An arrow blazing with power hit Einak in the middle of the
chest and exploded in a blaze of light. When everyone's dazzled vision
cleared, the copper scorpion-broo could be seen slumped against the
altar, blood pouring from a massive hole through its chest.
<p>
Voron took one look, and dove behind the marble slab altar. Rabnai,
the brass-horned broo, joined him there as another blazing arrow just
missed his head.
<p>
BOOM! It exploded against the marble floor of the quarry and showered
rock splinters in all directions.
<p>
"MOM! ARE YOU HURT?" Trunks' face blanched in terror for his mother.
<p>
"NO, I'M NOT HURT." Bulma thought she wasn't likely to stay unhurt,
tied up on display in the middle of a battle, but she spared Trunks
that encouraging thought.
<p>
Enforcer strode forward, scanning the quarry for the deadly
archer. From the angle of the shots, the archer was on one of the
upper terraces, or flying... Nothing. He could see nothing. The shadow
demon growled. So, the elusive Defender-of-Temples had returned!
<p>
"Put out the fires," he snarled to the worthless human slaves.
Enforcer would battle in his element, darkness.
<p>
SHIIP! SHIIP! SHIPP! SHIPP!  Bulma dropped to the ground as the ropes
binding her parted, neatly sliced by four arrows.

<p>
Goten opened his eyes a crack; they were still flying through the
night. He held very still; as long as the bad dinosaur thought Goten
was still asleep, it wouldn't hit him on the head and knock him out
again.
<p>
Goten was so very scared; he bit his lip to keep from crying. The bad
dinosaur must not hear him! He wished Daddy or Gohan or Uncle Raditz
or <i>someone</i> was here to help him. He wished very hard, with all his
heart.
<p>
*Goten*
<p>
A kind voice in his head, where the 'not-fun' people spoke.. like
Uncle Raditz used to. But he couldn't answer! The bad dinosaur would
hear him!
<p>
*Just think of what you would say, as if you were just about to say
it, and I'll hear you*
<p>
Grandma Kinoko? I want my daddy!
<p>
*Talk to Raditz; tell him that*
<p>
But he's not here!
<p>
*You've talked to my son before when he wasn't here. Like this..* and
she showed Goten.
<p>
Oh. Wow! I can do that?
<p>
*Yes, you can do that. Be brave, little warrior; your path will not be
easy, but courage will see you through*
<p>
Something kissed Goten lightly on the forehead; Kinoko told him one
more thing--and was gone.
<p>

<p>
&lt;NUNK RATS!&gt;
<p>
"Huh?" Raditz halted in mid-air, prompting an "Urk!" from Nezumi.
<p>
&lt;Goten?&gt; answered Raditz. &lt;I hear you, kid&gt;
<p>
"What's going on?" she asked.
<p>
"It's Goten; I can hear him, but I can't sense his presence."
<p>
&lt;N'Uncle Raditz, the bad dinosaur that hit Mama tricked me! He came
back and pretended to be Daddy and grabbed me! I want you and Daddy
and Gohan!&gt;
<p>
"I don't hear anything," Nezumi looked around, confused.
<p>
&lt;Goten, listen--tell me where you are, if you can&gt;
<p>
&lt;I DON'T KNOW!&gt; the child wailed mentally. &lt;It's dark, and the bad
dinosaur is flying up in the air!&gt;
<p>
&lt;Can you see the ground? Lights? Anything different? Which way is the
moon?&gt;
<p>
"He's speaking telepathically," Raditz tossed out an aside to Nezumi.
<p>
&lt;The moon is back that way, N'Uncle Raditz.&gt; Raditz got an impression
of the lunar orb shining behind them. &lt;Oooh! I see some fires. The bad
dinosaur is turning toward the fires&gt;.
<p>
"They're toward Satan City somewhere," Raditz said absently, as he
reversed direction and flew back the way he came.
<p>
&lt;N'Uncle Raditz! The fires are in a big, big, big hole in the ground!&gt;
<p>
&lt;Goten, do you mean a cave??&gt;
<p>
&lt;No! It's a hole in the ground! I know what a cave is--I'm not
stupid!&gt; Goten thought indignantly. &lt;It's got giant steps going down
to the middle, and the walls are all white&gt;
<p>
"A hole in the ground with giant steps?" Raditz muttered aloud.
<p>
&lt;Kid, can you show me a picture?  Think of what you're seeing.&gt;
<p>
"Crud! I see what he thinks he's seeing, and I don't recognize it,
either! It's a stepped pit, narrowing as it gets deeper, dug in some
white rock. There are ramps from level to level, and some buildings up
on the edge.."
<p>
"Stepped pit?" Nezumi thought aloud. "Sounds like a quarry to me--I'VE
GOT IT! RADITZ, STOP FOR A MINUTE!" She pulled out her map as Raditz
halted in mid-air again.  "Look!" Nezumi pointed at the map; "There's
an abandoned marble quarry northwest of Satan City! Remember the
marble dust in the footprints?"
<p>
"What? All I see on that map is 'Quarry'--how do you know all that
other stuff?" Raditz was skeptical, worried, hopeful all at once.
<p>
"I used to be a cop, remember?  Five years ago there was a double
homicide out there--the owner and his wife--and the investigation was
a hot item in the department for a while. I hear the property got
tangled up in legal fights between the heirs, and no one has actually
operated the quarry in the last few years. Okay?"
<p>
Reading a map while dangling in mid-air from someone's arms would have
been daunting enough for most people, but not Nezumi. She twisted her
head and shoulders around to look Raditz in the face to see his
reaction--and turned crimson as she realized how close he was.
Fortunately for Nezumi's dignity, Raditz's thoughts were elsewhere.
<p>
&lt;Goten, we're on the way! Hang on, kid!&gt;

<p>
Deputy hovered above the quarry pit. &lt;O Greater Self! Cacodemon!&gt;
<p>
Thoughts hurled across the mindlink, to meet an animalistic
rage. Deputy growled to himself; this incarnation of his demon-god
parent was stupid and madly aggressive--exactly what Cacodemon had
feared. He sensed his greater self as if it was a second body he wore
miles away--Deputy searched that self, and studied his gifts.
<p>
&lt;MASTER! YOU ARE NOT READY!&gt; Deputy shouted over the mindlink. &lt;YOU
ARE WASTING YOUR POWER--DISPERSE BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!&gt;
<p>
Only rage answered him, rage at the two tiny figures that taunted
it. Deputy howled in anger; one was Son Goku! Already the battle had
begun. He would have to invoke the Name to bring Cacodemon to
heel--and that was not a trivial ritual.  First he would have to end
this little fracas in the quarry-temple, and hope that his greater
self survived until then.
<p>
Deputy bellowed his anger and frustration as he descended; someone's
body and soul would pay for this!  Scout circled below him, bringing
the child Goten; Deputy almost howled with anticipation. Yes, the
child's blood and agony would slake his rage!
<p>
Intent on his thoughts and worries, Deputy took no note of the streak
of white fire approaching from the southeast...

<p>
Bulma collapsed gracelessly to the ground, her legs numb from hours of
being tied up, unconscious. She rolled behind the wooden frame, and
looked again.
<p>
"TRUNKS!" Darkness crept in as the fires were put out one by one; in
the dimness, Bulma could see the white glow surrounding her son. So
could Enforcer.
<p>
With a roar, the shadow demon stepped over the altar towards Trunks--
<p>
A high-pitched yell split the air. "ARROW STORM!"
<p>
SHOOM! SHOOM! SH-SH-SHOOM! SHOOM! SH-SH-SHOOM-SH-SH-SHOOM!
<p>
Enforcer howled and staggered as dozens of blazing arrows impaled him,
pierced him, blasted through him. Dark ichor ran from dozens of gaping
wounds; the monster fell to his knees, coughing black blood.
<p>
Bulma finally got control of her legs and staggered to her feet,
looking this way and that; the wounded demon was between her and
Trunks! Finally she ran around <i>behind</i> the altar--
<p>
--a rough hand grabbed Bulma by the ankle and pulled her down. Rabnai
leaped out from his hiding place under the altar slab and threw
himself on the blue-haired woman. "You're mine," he leered.
<p>
Trunks screamed in rage; the wooden frame exploded as power blazed
around the lavendar-haired boy.  He dropped to the ground, loose
manacles still hanging from his wrists and ankles.
<p>
"LEAVE MY MOTHER ALONE!" Trunks jumped over the altar in one bound to
confront the brass-haired broo.
<p>
Rabnai jumped to his feet, snarling. The metal-horned broo raised one
hand and pointed at Trunks; a narrow beam of green light darted from
his finger to splash off the aura surrounding Trunks.
<p>
"No, you idiot--not a Disruption! He's too strong!" Voron could be
heard cursing from under the altar in the silence that followed.
<p>
Rabnai snarled wordlessly, lowered his head, and charged Trunks,
razor-edged horns foremost. Trunks dodged nimbly aside, twisted, swept
one foot out, and tripped the charging broo. Rabnai went skidding on
his face for several yards--
<p>
Under the altar, Voron's fingers wove and twisted as he incanted a
spell--
<p>
High above, Deputy looked around. Yes! That flurry of arrows came from
right.. over.. there! The source was still invisible, but Deputy knew
his prey had to be there. He folded wings and dropped--
<p>
Trunks moved his hands rapidly in a series of gestures--
<p>
In response to Voron's silent call, the two lesser broo pushed through
the rapidly thinning crowd toward the altar.
<p>
THWACK! Another steel arrow impaled the goat-horned broo. The
antelope-horned broo dove for cover without waiting to find out what
happened--
<p>
With a roar, Deputy spun in mid-air and lashed out with his tail. It
connected! There was a cry of pain, and a dark shape fell to the
quarry floor, flung by the force of the blow.
<p>
A plume of searing energy erupted from Trunks' flattened palm,
enveloping Rabnai the Broo. There was a long drawn-out cry as the
demon was consumed by Trunks' power.
<p>
Sinhika staggered to her feet, still holding her steel bow; blood ran
down her face. She promptly vanished again.
<p>
Bulma tried to bolt to cover, only to find that she could not move! It
felt like she was embedded in thick, gooey mud--only with the greatest
effort could she move an arm a few inches.
<p>
Voron laughed. "Don't bother. You're much too important to Lord
Dairi-Mao for me to let you get away."
<p>
Out of the corner of his eye, a flash of lavendar hair--
<p>
"SHIELD!" A flare of power as Voron crossed his arms over his face--
<p>
"HAIIII-YAAA!" Trunks flung a blast of ki at the Chaos sorceror, who
vanished in a cloud of glittering white dust and smoke. As Trunks
watched, the smoke cleared to reveal a trail of scorch marks twenty
yards long. Voron crouched at the end of it, forced against the back
wall of the quarry, arms still crossed in front of his face, clothes
smouldering. The goth sorceror lifted his head cautiously, and peeked
at Trunks over his arms.
<p>
"Uhhhnnn!" Trunks doubled over as Deputy's tail swept down out of the
darkness to catch him in the stomach. The force of the blow picked him
up and flung him back over the altar to fall on the quarry floor. For
long seconds, the boy did not move.
<p>
"YOU BASTARD!" The shrieks were simultaneous from Bulma and from the
empty air, followed by--
<p>
"ARROW STORM!"
<p>
SHOOM! SHOOM! SH-SH-SHOOM! SHOOM! SH-SH-SHOOM-SH-SH-SHOOM! Blazing
arrows lanced out of the darkness toward Deputy as he settled on the
altar--
<p>
--only to glance off his armored hide, or be flicked away with one
contemptously wave of his razor-clawed hand. Deputy's jaws opened
wide, and fire vomited into the air. A dark shape was suddenly
silhouetted in the blaze, and someone screamed; the shape fell from
the air to smash into the rocks below.
<p>
Trunks stirred, groaning with pain as he sat up. His face and right
shoulder were dusty and bleeding from hitting the rocks. He panted,
short of breath, exhausted. He looked up as a shadow came between him
and the fires at the altar.
<p>
Enforcer loomed over him as it plucked the last of the arrows from its
chest, the shadowstuff rippling and closing over the wounds. It
grinned, baring all those impossibly sharp teeth. A massively clawed
hand lashed out and knocked Trunks sprawling.
<p>
Deputy leaped into the air, great wings flapping; as he passed over
the quarry, his tail snapped down to pick up a fallen body from the
quarry floor, and fling it at the foot of the altar.
<p>
&lt;Summon the best of my broo, Enforcer! This one has power! Clean up
this mess and prepare--I will return soon!&gt;
<p>
Voron staggered back to the altar to where Bulma was still caught in
his spell. An evil smirk twisted his face; he slapped Bulma twice,
ringing blows on either side of her face. "You and your brat will pay
for that, oh yes! There's still one broo left--weak as he is, I'm sure
he'll be strong enough for you. The rest of us will take turns
entertaining the boy." The sorceror laughed cruelly.
<p>
Enforcer flung Trunks limp body at Voron's feet, followed by
another--this one strange to Bulma. A black-skinned girl with orange
hair.. and fangs, and sharp claws; she was unconscious, somewhat
singed, and bleeding from various scrapes and cuts.  There was
something familiar about her, nonetheless..
<p>
"Bind them!" Enforcer commanded his lackeys, and they hurried to obey.
<p>
"Why are you doing this to us?" Bulma asked Voron, mind numb with
horror.
<p>
"Oh, that's part of the torment--we're going to degrade and torture
your son to death in front of your very eyes, and do the same to
you--and you'll never know why." Voron smiled, an insane light in his
eyes.
<p>
A narrow-winged shaped spiralled down from the dark sky; Scout landed
atop the altar, clutching a small, dark-haired body to his chest.
<p>
"Masssters! I have the child Goten!"

<p>
"DIIIIIEE!!" Vegeta screamed as he flung the blazing ki sphere at his
enemy. The hulking monster raised his weapon and batted the sphere
away to explode somewhere in the distance--only to stagger as a
barrage of dozens of smaller blasts hit him and exploded. Vegeta dove
in to rain blow after blow on the monster, only to have it dodge and
block him with its weapon.
<p>
By the light of his own attack, Vegeta could see the monster; it was
black, massively muscled, armored in ancient blood-red metal, and bore
a disturbing resemblance to the Ferryman. Disturbing, for where the
Ferryman was laconic and peaceful, this monster was all snarling
rage--muscles knotted, veins standing out, eyes wide, nostrils flared,
froth and blood dripping from its lips. It towered over Prince Vegeta,
twelve feet of madness and fury incarnate.
<p>

<p>
Some time before, Solace-In-Darkness had left in him at the edge of
darkness, with only a parting whisper:
<p>
*Beware my brother. Hate is his nature, and he hates Light most of
all*
<p>
Vegeta had wandered for a while, marking the landmarks and contours of
this strange new hell--a dark rocky wilderness lit only by the
Saiyan's own power.  No plants save mushrooms and strange fungi
softened the jagged hills; no birdsongs pierced the silence; only
monstrous insects crawled over the broken wilderness of
Darkness. Other dark shapes flitted at the edge of awareness; Vegeta
knew he had been watched.
<p>
The monster ambushed him in a narrow defile through the hills. As
Vegeta ran through the shadowed canyon--reluctant to waste precious
energy on flight--the thing--larger and broader than even the late
Doddoria--had lept from the shadowed rocks and smashed him down with a
single over-hand blow of the terrible flaming club that it carried.
<p>
It had <i>tried</i> to smash him down, that is. Vegeta's reflexes had
kicked in and he'd danced nimbly aside, responding with a quick blast
from his right hand. That was the first time the monster parried one
of his blasts with its club.
<p>
"Child of Dehore, snuff this fire!" howled the monster, and flung
something blacker than darkness to envelope Prince Vegeta.
<p>
Cold. Silence. Darkness. Terror. The primordial Darkness of the
Chambers of Subere seemed to embrace the Saiyan prince once again, a
black oblivion that sought to empty him into nothingness...
<p>
No.
<p>
Searing cold, ancient terrors of night and shadow, devils lurking in
the darkness, just behind, ready to devour the blind, helpless
prince...
<p>
No!
<p>
Freezing, numbing, soul-draining cold, paralyzing the lost prince,
leaving him forever blind and frozen, forgotten and alone...
<p>
NO!  I AM VEGETA, PRINCE OF THE SAIYAJIN, AND YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A
SHADOW!
<p>
Light exploded outward, piercing the Darkness with fiery arrows until
it shrivelled, crackled, and disappeared. Golden fire enveloped
Vegeta, seethed and flickered through his hair, intensifying until his
hair blazed golden, his dark eyes now green as turquoise as he glared
at the monster.
<p>
"DIE, LIGHT-SON, DIIIIEE!!" thundered Zorak Zoran, Darkness god of
Death and Hate, brother of Xiola Umbar, who is also called
Solace-In-Darkness--and the battle was joined.

In the Ninth Hour, the Barge of Ra ran aground, scraping the
wreckage-strewn bed of the Stygian Nile. Diverted by Apep's Chasm, the
waters of the Stygian Nile no longer flowed in their ancient bed, and
the Sun was stranded in the depths of Night.

In Hell, Commander Kale waited impatiently for Negi to gather the rest
of the small team--they'd scattered to the four winds as soon as they
returned from the mission. Typical, thought Kale sourly. Negi and his
cronies would rather brawl in the barracks than chase will-o-wisp
demons out in the slime canyons.  At least in the barracks they were
sure of finding someone to fight.
<p>
Some of them, Kale reflected darkly, still didn't understand the whole
point of Hell; they were still sure there must be some way to "have
fun" down here--or to get out. Kale himself wasn't sure he understood
the point of this place.  Why were they condemned to this realm of
endless sorrow? Justice? No--the victims of the Saiyans had their
justice already, when the Saiyans all died the very same death they'd
dealt out to so many others. Lives ripped away in an instant, a unique
world utterly destroyed; no descendants to remember them or mourn
them, not even graves to hold their bones, just dust drifting in the
void of space.  No--what had happened to them was not justice; it went
too far. What crime had the very fish and birds and beasts of
Vegetasai committed, that the whole world should be slain like that?
<p>
He knew that he'd done evil things in his lifetime--if Kale had had
any doubts, his Judgement had made everything terribly clear--but what
choice had he had?  It was what the Saiyans were; they were born to
fight--blame whatever gods made us that way! The life he'd lived and
died was the only life he knew; was it justice to be damned for being
what the gods had made of him?  Was it right to suffer eternally for
doing his duty, for his loyalty to his king, for his courage in
battle? He'd done what was right by his people's laws and traditions
all his life--he had nothing to regret. Yet still he suffered in this
place of anguish...
<p>
Tap, tap.
<p>
"What the?" Kale whirled, startled by the unexpected tap on his
shoulder. No one ever dared <i>tap</i> a commander on the shoulder! He
stared in confused astonishment at the pink-haired girl in the black
leather miniskirt who stood there, scowling angrily. Who--oh, yes. One
of the lost souls they'd picked up in the Pit.
<p>
"What do you think you're--" the white-cloaked Saiyan started to
snarl.
<p>
"Doing? What I want to know is that the hell you think you're
doing?!?" snapped Pomona, cutting him off in mid-question. She
continued without giving Kale a chance to answer. "I wasn't going to
complain about the 'accomodations', seeing as this <i>is</i> Hell and it's
temporary, but the company is another thing entirely! What did you do,
search the hells for the two slimiest bastards you could find to put
in with us??  If that child-molesting psychopath wasn't bad
enough--fortunately Melc and I are a bit too old for his tastes!--that
other little weasel pervert, the one who was whimpering all the way
here, got his courage and his pathetic excuse for manhood up and made
a major annoyance of himself." Pomona skirted the details, but the
disgust was plain on her face. "Now don't get me wrong, I can handle
his type, but your man Negi had to go and interfere before I got
finished with him--and then he wouldn't let us find some other room
away from those creeps! I am NOT going back there, and neither is
Melchior!" Pomona crossed her arms indignantly; Kale noticed for the
first time that Negi and the other gaudily-haired human were behind
her.
<p>
Kale glared disdainfully at Pomona, and spoke to Negi. "Why am I being
bothered with this?"
<p>
Negi looked sheepish. "The others don't want them back, either." A
ghost of a smirk flashed across his face for a moment, and he
continued, "and there'll be less trouble if we separate them. I don't
have the authority to do that, sir--and you said we can't punish them,
because they haven't been condemned yet."
<p>
He didn't need this. Commander Kale really didn't need this-- The King
was displeased with his inability to finish off the alien demons
infesting the Pit of Worms, he was about to enter an unknown rift to
who-knows-where to face who-knew-what, and now this!  His best
sergeant was bothering him about a bunch of insignificant lost <i>human</i>
souls!
<p>
"Since you're so concerned about these.. these creatures," Kale
growled, "I'm detaching you to Captain Nappa's command! He and his
guards will be taking them to Lord Enma--you will escort them, and see
that everyone stays out of trouble and in one piece!"
<p>
Negi paled. "I'll be facing Lord Enma again?"
<p>
Commander Kale smiled cruelly. "Very likely. Enjoy the trip!" With
that, he turned on his heel and strode down the hall.
<p>
"What a jerk!" Pomona observed as the Saiyan commander disappeared
into the distance.
<p>
Negi turned abruptly, snarling. "Shut up, woman! You've already caused
enough trouble--keep your vulgar tongue to yourself! <i>Commander</i> Kale
is a commander, and of noble blood; <i>you're</i> not even Saiyan!" The
one-eyed warrior trembled with rage and something else; one hand was
half-raised as if on the verge of striking. "Orders or no orders, if
either of you says another disrespectful word, I'll.. I'll.." he
trailed off.
<p>
Pomona flinched back, surprised by his vehemence. Melchior smiled
wryly. "Yeah, I guess that would be a problem. You can't very well
kill us, can you?"
<p>
The Saiyan warrior scowled, raising his fist again. "I can make you
wish you could die!"
<p>
The green-haired youth nodded gravely, "I do not doubt that. I was not
mocking you, merely pointing out the.. oddities of the situation."
<p>
Negi tossed his hair back, and smirked momentarily. "The 'oddities of
the situation'. Yeah. That's a good one." He folded his arms and
stared at the two colorfully-maned humans. "Now what the hell am I
going to do with you two?  You'll just start trouble if I put you back
with the others."
<p>
Pomona shrugged. "Well, your commander did order you to escort us--how
about we just sort of tag along with you? We won't cause any trouble,
will we, Melc?"
<p>
Melchior shook his head. "Nah, I never cause trouble." He turned
briefly away, to hide a smile.
<p>
Negi scowled some more, then shrugged. "Hmmph. Might as well; things
can't possibly get more screwed up! Come on!" The one-eyed Saiyan
strode down the hall, then paused. "And keep your mouths shut when I
report to Captain Nappa! I don't need to be embarrassed by a pair of
ill-mannered humans!"
<p>
Every time Negi thought he'd gotten used to Hell, it threw a new curve
at him. Not only was he saddled with these two annoying humans, he
would be facing Lord Enma again. Negi shivered involuntarily; no
Saiyan in Hell--no <i>anyone</i> in Hell--could remember Judgement with
anything but terror.
<p>
The only difference between Saiyans, as far as Negi could tell, was in
how well they denied it. Negi shivered again; he couldn't. It was with
him every instant, lurking in the background--the terror of that
infinite moment when all illusions were ripped away and his own
rotten, blood-stained soul stood revealed to himself and He Who
Judged. Negi could not forget, no matter how much he wanted to, what a
wretched excuse for a person he'd been, and what a damned waste of a
life he'd led. He deserved to be where he was.
<p>
He glanced back at the two humans. Poor bastards! They had no idea
what awaited them--or maybe they would be lucky, and find themselves
to be worthwhile, in spite of whatever sins were theirs. But that
wouldn't be luck, would it?
<p>
Negi's instincts told him they didn't belong here--he hoped his
instincts were right. The boy was an interesting set of
contradictions--all the pacifists Negi had ever run into had been easy
victims, unwilling and unable to fight back, but this youth who
claimed to be a pacifist fought back with admirable skill for a mere
human, let alone one who "didn't like to fight". Negi's eyes narrowed;
maybe it would be more correct to say that the boy didn't like to
<i>start</i> fights. Negi smirked to himself; the green-haired boy
certainly liked to finish them with himself as the winner.
<p>
As for the woman in black... <i>she</i> certainly had no compunction about
starting or finishing fights! Too bad his orders required him to
interfere-- letting her carve off pieces of that weasel Kidoru
wouldn't fit "keep the lost souls in one piece and see them safely to
Lord Enma". What a pity! If only.. Negi thought wistfully, if only she
and I were alive and she were a Saiyan...
<p>
And she was right; Commander Kale was a jerk.

"DIIIIEE!" Vegeta hurled a barrage of ki blasts at the hulking
death god. Zorak Zoran dodged with a surprising agility for a creature
of his bulk, an agility that reminded Vegeta unpleasantly of
Doddoria. What he didn't dodge, he simply shrugged off, letting it
explode against his bloody red armor.
<p>
The monstrous god threw his head back and howled, swinging his huge,
flaming leaden club with unbelievable swiftness and force. With
equally unbelievable swiftness, Vegeta dodged; the blow split the
earth beneath him, opening a deep chasm.
<p>
Zorak Zoran wrapped his left hand loosely around the flaming club, and
drew fire from it, forming a ball which he hurled suddenly at
Vegeta--then several more fireballs in quick sucession. Vegeta dodged
several; then, tiring of the game, simply flicked them away with a
touch of his hand to explode in the distant hills.
<p>
Again Vegeta drove in, raining a flurry of blows on the
monster--impotent blows. The death god's massive armor and more
massive body simply shrugged off Vegeta's strikes. The hulking monster
howled again, and lashed out left and right with his club, blows which
narrowly missed Vegeta, driving him back toward the chasm. Vegeta
smirked; the monster was used to fighting on the ground, against
opponents that couldn't fly!
<p>
Vegeta leaped into the air--
<p>
--and Zorak Zoran leaped forward, grabbing the Saiyan's leg. The
monster roared and slammed Vegeta into the ground with the one hand;
with his other hand, he smashed the club into the downed prince with
bone-crushing force. Vegeta cried out in pain, and the monster
laughed, raising his club in both hands for a second blow.

Engrossed in his drawing, Sean did not hear the slow turning of his
doorknob, nor the scratching as someone slipped a jimmy behind the
bolt--but he did notice when Caleb tried to club him down from behind.
<p>
"WHAT THE HELL?" Sean dove to one side, scattering his pencils and
drawing on the floor.  He rolled and came to his feet, looking across
the couch at Caleb, both hands clenched in fists. Two other men had
followed Caleb into his apartment; they laughed unpleasantly, circling
around either end of the couch.
<p>
Sean flipped his black hair out of his eyes, and eased himself back
and to the left. The goon on that side raised his fists and lunged at
Sean, fist swinging in a solid hook to Sean's chin.
<p>
It never got there. Sean swept his left arm up, blocking the blow, and
snap-kicked the goon in the shin with his steel-toed boot. The
muscular thug yelled and stumbled, giving Sean his chance. He rushed
the goon, throwing his own hard-muscled, six-foot-tall body against
the burly man, knocking him sprawling.
<p>
Caleb snarled, and leaped in front of the open door, cutting off
Sean's escape. Sean recovered his balance and smiled coldly; he hadn't
been trying to escape. He reached into the corner, behind the stereo
speaker, and grabbed the axe handle he kept there.
<p>
Anger seethed through Sean at this culmination of a thoroughly rotten
month-- first losing his job, then the near-eviction from this roach
motel, losing all his artwork, then the earthquake, and finally these
creeps assaulting him in his own goddamn apartment! His cold smile
turned into a snarling rictus--God, he wanted to hurt someone, and
these bastards had just given him an excuse.
<p>
"All right, you bastards, you want me--COME AND GET ME!"
<p>
It was over in less than five minutes. Sean panted heavily, down on
one knee, leaning on the axe handle. Blood trickled over his left
eyebrow from a cut on his forehead; his lower lip was already swollen
where he'd been hit.
<p>
Sean thought that the one who'd run probably had several broken ribs
or a ruptured spleen; he knew the man had a broken arm. Sean had
broken it for him. He knew for sure that the other guy on the floor
had broken ribs, a broken collarbone, and probably a busted skull;
Sean was not sure if he was still breathing, and didn't care enough to
check.  His un-neighborly neighbor Caleb definitely wasn't breathing,
but his blood and brains were making a mess of the carpet and his axe
handle.
<p>
The place was a mess.  The brief but vicious fight had knocked over
everything the earthquake had left standing, and everything he'd
started picking up afterwards.  Sean got to his feet painfully,
cursing; even the painting had been a casualty of the fight. He picked
up the broken stand, and straightened the bent legs as best he could,
then gently picked up the painting and put it back on its stand. He
frowned; someone had gotten blood on his painting!
<p>
"Nice fight; nice work. That your painting?"
<p>
Sean whirled. "Oh, crud."
<p>
Behind him, leaning insouciantly against the doorway between his tiny
studio and the so-called 'living' room was a demon from his
painting--muscular, almost-human body, not-quite-human face, brown and
green combat armor, katana, short white cloak, brown fur belt wrapped
around his waist.  As Sean stared, he felt that there was something
not quite real about the demon, like something from a dream. Sean
swallowed hard as he recognized this demon as the white-cloaked one
kneeling before the demon king in the original version of his
painting.
<p>
Commander Kale smiled coldly at Sean; he'd found his quarry.
<p>

<p>
Vegeta glared across the chasm at Zorak Zoran, breathing hard. He'd
rolled at the last moment, tossing himself into the chasm, and jumped
out the other side. The Darkness god roared at him across the gap, and
backed up, tensing his legs.
<p>
He's going to <i>jump</i> the chasm! Vegeta realized. I was right; he can't
fly! Even as he thought it, the death god ran forward and leaped--
<p>
--Vegeta darted into the air, and plunged down, slamming his fist into
the mad god's back as he hung in mid-jump. The force of the blow
slammed Zorak Zoran into the depths of the chasm; Vegeta settled down
on the other side, poised for the next move.
<p>
His eyes widened as the massive creature jumped to his feet, bellowing
and roaring. Foam spattered its jaws, and it <i>ran</i> straight up the
side of the chasm, booted toes kicking into the side of the rock in
its rage to get at Vegeta.
<p>
In answer, Vegeta's power blazed around him in a fury of white
fire. Stone cracked, shattered, and blew away, disintegrated by the
mere backwash of his power. He reached the screaming crescendo of his
power just as the mad death god leaped over the edge of the chasm and
charged, club raised, tongue lolling from froth-filled mouth.
<p>
Fire, Light and Darkness exploded in a blinding flash and concussion
that shattered the very hills around them. When the smoke cleared,
Zorak Zoran still stood. Great gaping holes were torn in his armor;
red blood streaked his coal black hide. The mighty barrel-shaped chest
heaved with great gasping breaths, and the light of madness filled his
eyes. He raised his club again.
<p>
Vegeta also stood, gasping, his armor cracked and singed. His right
arm moved slowly as he wiped away the blood trickling from his mouth,
still half-numbed by the death god's blows. He grinned, the mad joy of
battle dancing in his eyes.
<p>
"You're one tough bastard," Vegeta snarled. "I'm going to enjoy
finishing you off!"

Deputy's wings flared as he alighted on a mountaintop near the
quarry. Yes, this was far enough away; the Names which must be spoken
would be heard by Deputy alone. He held his wings half-spread as he
concentrated on the link between himself and Cacodemon.
<p>
The great body tensed, leg muscles bunching as Deputy crouched, ready
to spring and rend--only it was his mind that sprang, sprang into
Cacodemon's, fighting to get the animalistic demon's attention. At
last he began, still not sure if the tiny, maddened mind was even
listening.

The glowing red monstrosity howled again, and charged, but Goku and
Piccolo could not hear it.
<p>
"..-" Goku's hands cupped--
<p>
"..-" his body slipped into the familiar stance--
<p>
Piccolo put two fingers to his forehead, concentrating so hard the
veins knotted in his green scalp--
<p>
"..-" Power gathered between Goku's curved fingers--
<p>
Piccolo's fingertips began to glow brightly--
<p>
"..-" Goku drew his hands back, the glow between his hands so
brilliant it shined through his flesh--
<p>
Piccolo extended his arm full length--
<p>
"..!" The brilliant white sphere of a Kamehameha wave plunged down,
straight toward the demon--
<p>
"..............!" A narrow shaft of energy, sheathed in a violet
spiral of energy stabbed down into the demon as Piccolo fired his
Makankosappo--
<p>
Once again, a second sun rose in the middle of the Western Capital;
Goku and Piccolo shielded their eyes from the full fury of their own
attacks. When it cleared, and they could see again, there was no sign
of the gigantic demon.
<p>
"..... .. .. ..?" Goku asked, looking puzzled. He shook his head,
frowning; his face brightened as he remembered something.  From the
pouch at his belt, Goku plucked two senzu beans, and tossed one to
Piccolo.
<p>
"What happened, Piccolo? I can't sense him anywhere!" Goku asked as
soon as their hearing returned.
<p>
"It <i>appears</i> that we destroyed him," Piccolo said slowly. "But you
are right to question--that was too easy."
<p>
Goku nodded. "My attack wasn't powerful enough to completely destroy
something with that much power."
<p>
"I have a feeling that we will hear of that monster again," said
Piccolo ominously. "And we will not like what we hear."

Vegeta crouched atop the rocky spire, looking down at Zorak Zoran, who
bellowed up at him. All around, the landscape was shattered and melted
from the fury of their battle. Wouldn't anything kill that creature?
<p>
The death-god swung his club, shattering the base of the rocky
spire. As it collapsed, Vegeta held out his one good hand--
<p>
"GYARICK-HO!" The brilliant, dense beam, capable of destroying a
planet, lanced out, catching the darkness god squarely in the
middle. His outline faded and seemed to dissolve in the blinding white
fury--
<p>
SHRACKKK-KOOOMM! The ground exploded where the beam struck, smashing
its way deep into the fabric of the Helldarks. Far, far below, the
beam flashed and detonated; superheated steam geysered out of the new
chasm.  Vegeta settled to the ground, chest heaving--the last blast
had taken almost everything he had.
<p>
"Die!" Zorak Zoran rasped.

It had been a long time since they'd fought together. Longer than mere
years; it had been a lifetime ago. And yet, Bardock reflected as he
waited for Toma and Celipa, it felt like yesterday.
<p>
Yesterday.. the day they all died. The day Bardock tried to stop
Frieza, to save the homeworld, to avenge his dead friends. The day he
failed, failed them, failed his world, failed himself. The day Bardock
and his world died.
<p>
After the day, nightmare. At first, Bardock couldn't have said why he
rebelled when he was cast into Hell; he only knew that he could not
accept what fate had decreed--his pride and his rage would not let
him. That's what he would have said then.
<p>
Later.. he understood. His anger at Frieza's murder of his team and
his people had very little to do with pride--it was the <i>injustice</i>
that ate at him. The Saiyans had served Frieza faithfully and
well--and in return, their prince was taken, their king murdered, and
finally, all of them exterminated in the blink of an eye. It was just
plain <i>wrong</i>.
<p>
It had taken longer to understand that his anger was not aimed purely
at Frieza, but at whatever powers that had permitted this atrocity to
happen. He had been cursed with foreknowledge, yet denied the ability
to <i>do</i> anything about it--that was the Kunassasei-jin's vengeance for
the extinction of his race. A paltry vengeance; Bardock had not lived
long enough to suffer from it. Those visions of Kakarott's future had
given Bardock one last hope to take with him into death.
<p>
It had seemed unjust to Bardock that he should have been given that
glimpse of the future, given the chance to act on it, only to find out
that all he'd done was futile. He'd given everything his broken,
bleeding body had left to stop that damned frigid-blooded
monstrosity--and it wasn't enough, it never would have been
enough. Why? Why lead him into the last and greatest and finest battle
of his life, the only battle he'd ever fought that was truly <i>right</i>,
only to lose it all? He could have accepted death, even damnation, if
his death had <i>meant</i> something!
<p>
Last of all, Bardock finally understood the obvious.. it <i>was</i>
just. He and his people had died the same death they'd bestowed on so
many others. How many brave warriors of those other dead races had
fought desperately against the invading Saiyajin, sacrificing their
lives in futile attempts to stop their extinction? How many of them
had died asking "Why?"
<p>
It was <i>just</i>; a merciless justice, as merciless as the Saiyans
themselves had been. Bardock loved truth too much to deny it when it
stared him in the face.
<p>
"Hey, Bardock, you still with us?"
<p>
Bardock started; he hadn't noticed Toma and Celipa's arrival. The
tall, handsome Saiyan warrior and the short-haired Saiyan woman both
looked at him with some concern.
<p>
Toma frowned; Bardock brooding always disturbed him. Toma suspected
that Bardock still blamed himself for his failure to avenge his team,
still blamed himself for not being there to fight with them, no matter
how many times Toma tried to convince him otherwise.
<p>
Bardock sighed. "Unfortunately, yes." Realizing as he said it how that
must sound, he gave them both a slight smile. "I keep expecting to
wake from this nightmare someday..."
<p>
"Don't we all?" Celipa asked tartly.
<p>
"No," answered Toma slowly. "Too many of us have given up.."
<p>
"Saiyajin <i>giving up</i>??" Celipa's eyebrows went up; she was appalled.
<p>
"We were not made for this kind of fight," Toma explained. "This is a
battle of spirit, of heart--something we were never meant for. A
battle we don't even know how to win."
<p>
"Yes." Bardock answered simply. "Toma is right. Yet.." He looked off
into the distance, at the lurid, broken landscape, "..something in my
heart tells me there <i>is</i> a way to win this war, and sometimes I feel
like I'm on the very edge of discovering it."
<p>
"What makes you think Saiyajin can win? You know what we are!"
<p>
Bardock smiled at them. "Kakarott won his war. As did Diive and
Rashi." His voice dropped, and he said very softly, "So did Kinoko."
<p>
He glanced at the horizon, and back at them; Totepo and Panboukin had
just arrived. The team was complete. "Let's go. No more time for this;
there's a job that needs doing."
<p>

<p>
"I don't believe this!" Vegeta snarled in exasperation. He stared at
the monstrous death god.
<p>
Zorak Zoran swayed, barely on his feet. Scraps and tatters of charred
flesh hung down here and there. Torn and burnt muscles barely clung to
his bones; gaping wounds showed blackened internal organs beneath. His
skull was nearly bare of flesh; both eyes were but burnt and empty
sockets. His armor was completely blown away; only rags of living
darkness still cloaked him.
<p>
"I don't believe this!" Vegeta repeated. "Indrajit was in better shape
than you after I defeated him! What does it take to kill you?"
<p>
"Death," croaked Zorak Zoran as he raised his club. Fire billowed and
roared around the mystic weapon. Then the monster charged.
<p>
I don't have another beam like that left. Unless.. the last peach!
Weary, distracted, Vegeta dodged the mad god's weapon--straight into
his mighty fist.
<p>
"URK!" Vegeta doubled up, Zorak Zoran's seared fist buried in his
stomach. Time slowed down as Vegeta watched the Darkness god reverse
his swing, and slam the butt end of his club into the side of Vegeta's
head.
<p>
WHAM! Vegeta was flung to the ground by the force of the blow. He
blinked, trying to clear his eyes of blurriness, tried to roll away
from the next blow.
<p>
The death god roared and stomped on Vegeta's stomach; the Saiyan
prince screamed in agony. Zorak Zoran raised his club for the final
blow. Vegeta raised his left arm to block the blow, an instinctive,
futile gesture.
<p>
Of its own accord, his frozen, dead left hand opened, and caught the
flaming head of the death god's club. The flame guttered and died; the
club frosted over, and the icy cold of Hati's bite left Vegeta's hand at
last!
<p>
"HAI-YAAAAA!" Vegeta lunged up, plunging his right hand deep into
Zorak Zoran's exposed chest. He seized the monster's heart, captured
the essence of its being--
<p>
Knowledge and ravening, furious power washed over him, through
him. Prince Vegeta knew Zorak Zoran for what he was: ancient god of a
time now dead, master of Death and Darkness, Thief of Fire, wargod of
the Uz--the Men of Darkness--implacable enemy of Light and <i>Chaos</i>!
<p>
Knowledge Vegeta took, and something else--something hard and cold and
utterly uncompromising, something that had long been a part of him. He
took Death.
<p>
Without a backward glance he rose into the air, leaving the maimed god
behind on the Hill of Gold. In time, Vegeta's stolen knowledge told
him, the wargod's sister Xiola Umbar would find him and heal him as
she had healed Prince Vegeta, and Zorak Zoran would again stalk
through the infinite darkness, hunting Light and Chaos with merciless
fury.  He smirked at what else his new-found knowledge told him: in
this place, Zorak Zoran ambushed the Lightson, the Son of the Sun, and
stole Fire from him in the endless, eternally recurring cycle of the
Godtime.
<p>
"Only you failed in your ambush this time, didn't you?" Vegeta laughed
mockingly as he sped away.
<p>
Over the endless grey hills of the Helldarks he flew, toward the Chaos
Hells, where chaos gnawed at the foundations of the universe, and
reality fell apart. With his new knowledge, the Saiyan prince knew
that there, on the edge of annihilation, he would find the secret he
needed--and then let the gods of Chaos tremble!

<CENTER><P>CONTINUED IN CHAPTER XXV. THE RECKONING</P></CENTER>

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Reckon">XXV. THE RECKONING</A></H1>
<p>
&lt;SCOUT! Begin the ritual--summon one of the Talons!&gt; Enforcer
commanded in the little demon-dinosaur's mind.
<p>
The yellow winged-raptor-thing scurried to obey, dropping the
unconscious Goten at the foot of the altar beside Trunks and Bulma. It
bowed to the great shadow-demon Enforcer, and took up position behind
the altar, moving its claws in a brief series of gestures as it
focussed its power. The air above the altar began to curdle and warp.
<p>
Enforcer swung his massive head this way and that, looking things
over. "Sorceror, begin with the child Trunks."
<p>
Voron bowed. "As you command, Lord Keikan-Ma."  The slightly singed
sorceror turned to the nervous crowd. "You, and you and you! Get up
here!"
<p>
"GOTEN IS MINE!" snarled Deputy, dropping out of the night on silent
wings into the middle of the crowd. Vicious killers and rapists and
madmen scattered in every direction--save for one who had been
unfortunate enough to be directly under Deputy's hind claws. "BRING
HIM TO ME!"  The great demon's razor-clawed hands flexed open and
closed, acid slime dripping from the claws. Deputy licked his lips
with his barbed tongue.
<p>
Enforcer reached down--and the unconscious boy jumped up and ran!
<p>
"No you don't!" yelled Goten as he dodged clutching hands. Two thugs
dove for him, missed, and wound up butting heads as Goten slipped
between them.
<p>
Deputy howled in rage and disbelief as Goten evaded Enforcer, his
followers, and even Scout in turn.  The small boy darted toward the
empty part of the quarry--
<p>
Deputy snapped his wings and leaped across the quarry; his supple tail
lashed out and sent the small boy tumbling. Goten rolled to a stop
against a huge, cracked marble slab; Deputy alighted beside him, and
pinned the boy with one taloned foot. His great head lowered, and he
turned to glare at his followers, looking like nothing so much as a
great bird of prey, preparing to tear at some small, helpless animal
caught in its talons.
<p>
Crushed under the demon's foot, Goten couldn't even scream for help;
tears trickled from his eyes.
<p>
"FOOLS!" Deputy snarled, red eyes blazing. "WATCH--SEE HOW I WILL DO
UNTO THOSE WHO FAIL ME!" He turned back to the helpless boy, and bared
jagged teeth---
<p>
KRUNCH! A blazing comet of white fire plunged down from the heavens
and slammed into Deputy's back, knocking the great demon
sprawling--and off of Goten.
<p>
"GOTEN! RUN! GET OUT OF HERE, FAST!" Raditz shouted as he gathered a
ball of energy in his hand and hurled it into Deputy's face. His black
and white combat armor gleamed in the light of his attack.
<p>
BOOOM! Deputy was knocked over again; as the smoke cleared, he could
be seen shaking his dog-like head as if to clear it. Smoke curled up
from various spots on his fur.
<p>
Dazed and bruised, Goten struggled to his feet, and stumbled toward
the nearest cover, the cracked marble slab. "Nunk Rats!" he said
happily.
<p>
As Goten crawled under the slab, Raditz cut loose with a dozen ki
balls in rapid succession, battering and staggering Deputy. Deputy
roared and shook himself; gathering his powerful hindlegs under him,
Deputy leaped into the air into the teeth of Raditz's attack.
<p>
"Whoa!" Raditz darted up, out of the way as Deputy's massive jaws
crashed shut less than a foot from his legs had been. The demon's
great wings rowed the air as he rose, pursuing Raditz.
<p>
"I should have made sure you were dead--this time I will!" snarled
Deputy. "I will rip you apart and feast on your entrails; I will
devour your heart and your head; I will-- ARRRGGGHHHH!"
<p>
KA-ZAAPPP! A pinpoint blast to Deputy's right eye interrupted the
monster's rant; Raditz smirked as the demon roared in pain, blood
running from the blasted eye.
<p>
"First," Raditz growled, "you have to kill me--" He grinned fiercely,
"--and you already blew your one chance to do that!"
<p>
In reply, Deputy opened his jaws and vomited fire.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Bulma blinked, astonished. Voron and his men stood as if paralyzed,
entranced by the fight, Trunks forgotten. Even the big shadow monster,
Enforcer, was similarly engaged.
<p>
"I thought that monster said he killed Raditz," Bulma muttered. "Boy,
was he wrong!" She wriggled, trying to loosen the ropes around her
feet and wrists.
<p>
"Good thing, too. I'd hate to think of that long-haired hunk being
demon-chow," the dark-skinned demon-girl said unexpectedly.. with
Sinhika's voice.
<p>
Bulma turned her head; the orange-haired girl was conscious, though
battered, burned and tied up like Bulma. Bulma's eyes opened wide--
"You're Sinhika! Er, what are you?"
<p>
Sinhika raised an eyebrow, then looked down at herself. "Oops. Must
have lost the illusions when big ugly hit me," she muttered. "Come to
think of it, I remember hitting the ground--I don't remember being
tied up and dragged over here." Her face shimmered, and Bulma found
herself looking at the pretty young Indian girl she'd hired.
<p>
"A nightmare. This is all a dream you're having, you know."
<p>
Bulma snarled something impolite. "Don't even try to pretend--I never
had a nightmare give me this many bruises!"
<p>
Sinhika shrugged. "Well, it was worth a try. Let's just say that what
you saw is 'the real me', but I wear this face in public--fewer
hassles at job interviews, getting waited on at restaurants, shopping
in upscale malls..." She smiled mischieviously, and wriggled closer to
Bulma. "My face isn't the only real thing I hide. Here. See if you
can reach the small of my back..."
<p>
Bulma rolled over and felt along Sinhika's back with her bound hands.
Her fingers brushed something hard just above her waist.. Back a
bit.. Yes! Bulma's hand closed on the hilt of a knife.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz held out one hand, fending off Deputy's blast of fire, grinning
fiercely the whole time. His renewed energy seethed through him,
heightening his senses, his speed, his strength. His armor's bodysuit
hugged him like a second skin; the scouter rested comfortably over his
right eye like an old friend. The joy of battle sang in his blood, and
the prospect of vengeance sweetened his joy.
<p>
He couldn't read Deputy's power through the scouter, but that didn't
matter. Raditz could see the monster before him, and he had taken
Deputy's measure before.
<p>
"HAIIIII-YA! YA!" Raditz hurled two brilliant-white ki beams at
Deputy, one after the other. The demon canted his head, fending them
both off with a flick of his hand.
<p>
"FOOL! You have learned nothing--did you think you could hurt me with
such a feeble attack now, when you could not before?"
<p>
Raditz just grinned, and darted down to smash the root of Deputy's
left wing with a double-handed blow. The monster shuddered, and
whipped his tail up as he rolled to face Raditz.
<p>
Raditz dodged the supple tail--he <i>had</i> learned. The demon shrugged
off his blow, and lashed out with his claws--
<p>
The saiyan warrior dodged with a mocking laugh, then bodyslammed
Deputy's lower jaw, rocking the demon, disorienting it and leaving it
flailing in mid-air.
<p>
Deputy howled with rage, and snapped his wings hard as he flew in
pursuit of Raditz; the long-haired warrior rocketed high into the
sky. Deputy's jaws gaped wide, and he vomited fire again.
<p>
"Don't you ever learn?" Raditz smirked as he hurled a countering beam
down into the demon's mouth. The Saiyan's beam collided with Deputy's
fire; the two beams contended, striving, splashing off each other in
perfect balance. Raditz's smirk deepened into a grin; his beam
intensified, and smashed down the length of Deputy's fire blast to
explode in the demon's face.
<p>
BOOM! Once again Raditz heard Deputy's harsh yowl, a sound like metal
being ripped apart. When the smoke cleared, Deputy could be seen
clawing at his burnt and smoking mouth--the monster coughed, and
greyish slime drooled from the injured orifice. The monster growled at
Raditz, then folded its wings and dropped like a stone...

<p>
Goku frowned, then his face brightened. "There he is!" He put two
fingers to his forehead-- and froze.
<p>
"What is it, Son Goku?" Piccolo asked, slightly concerned by Goku's
odd behavior.
<p>
"Raditz. He keeps flickering--first he's there, then he's not. I can't
use Shikan Idou if he disappears while I'm halfway there!"
<p>
"I couldn't sense the demon he fought, either," Piccolo muttered, a
dark expression on his face.
<p>
"And I couldn't sense the demon that tried to kidnap Chi-chi and
Goten!" Goku's brow furrowed. "I don't like this! At least I know
where he was." White fire flared around him, and Goku hurtled through
the sky toward distant Satan City, Piccolo close behind.
<p>

<p>
Deputy's wings flared at the last instant, just before the great demon
hit the quarry floor. His powerful hindlegs bent, absorbing the shock
of landing. A heartbeat's pause, and Deputy's tail lashed out, hooking
the cracked marble slab concealing Goten and hurling it end-for-end
across the quarry.
<p>
Goten trembled, paralyzed by the sudden disappearance of his hiding
place. Deputy grinned, and reached down to pluck up the hapless
child--
<p>
--Only to snatch at empty air as Goten vanished, whisked away faster
than Deputy could see.  The chaos demon screeched with rage, and
leaped into the sky again, wings flapping madly as he searched for the
elusive Raditz.
<p>
"Looking for me?" A streaking comet stopped and became Raditz; and
Raditz grinned as power smouldered in both hands.
<p>
"DIE!" The infuriated demon dove, and then climbed to pursue the
rising Saiyan; poisoned teeth clashed shut inches from his
boots. Raditz just kept grinning, and flying ever higher...
<p>

<p>
"Well, let's see what we've got here," Nezumi said to herself as she
kicked in the door of the small shed.  Raditz had literally dropped
her at the edge of the quarry pit just before he plunged into the
fight; after picking herself up, brushing off the dirt and feeling
some new bruises, Nezumi decided to scout around.
<p>
It hadn't taken her long to notice that all the vehicles were down in
the pit, where the bonfire-lit festivities seemed to be taking
place. Up on the rim of the quarry was an assortment of buildings and
sheds; Nezumi picked the nearest one to investigate.
<p>
Her flashlight had somehow survived the night's adventures; she shined
it around the dusty building. Boxes, lots of crates--none of them the
least bit dusty.
<p>
"Very interesting!" Nezumi looked around and found a prybar, and
started doing some serious investigation.  As the top came off of the
first crate, she looked in.  What she saw caused her to catch her
breath for a long moment, then she whistled.
<p>
"My, my, my; someone is up to something naughty."  Nezumi very gently
lifted out one of twenty disposable anti-tank rockets in the
crate. "This could come in handy."
<p>

<p>
"Quick! Scootch up under the altar with me, and see if you can cut my
ropes," Sinhika instructed Bulma.
<p>
"Okaaay, but won't they stop us?" Bulma queried as she wriggled up to
Sinhika's back again. She bit her lip to stifle a cry as she bumped
her head on the altar.
<p>
As if in answer, something growled above; shouts were heard; Voron and
the remaining broo ran <i>past</i> where they were laying--
<p>
"Find them, you fools! They can't have gone very far, they're all tied
up!" Voron's voice cracked, hoarse with fear.
<p>
Sinhika chuckled. "They can't stop what they don't see!" She smiled
wickedly. "Hurry up, though--one of them could stumble over the boy by
accident."
<p>
Bulma nodded, though still confused, and worked carefully with her
bound hands to cut Sinhika's ropes and not the girl's wrists. "Does
this have something to do with the way your face changes when you're
unconscious?"
<p>
"Something like that. People see what I want them to see."

<p>
In Hell, in the Pit of Worms, a huge form crouched atop a narrow
spindle of rock, watching the murk above the canyon's floor. Bestial
eyes narrowed; clawed fingers twitched eagerly as the murk curdled and
twisted.
<p>
Another rift was opening, and the Captain of Ragnaglar was ready.
<p>

<p>
Raditz rose, energy seething in both hands. He grinned hellishly as
Deputy pursued him, half mad with rage.
<p>
"MAN--" Raditz brought his hands forward--
"KI--" and together--
"BATSU!" The two seething balls of energy fused with a blinding white
flash, and a huge white beam, tinged with incandescent violet slammed
down toward the angry demon.
<p>
Deputy jerked to one side, dodging frantically; Raditz laughed cruelly
as his beam curved to follow, blasting into the demon's side and out
the other side. Blackened ribs jutted upward as Deputy fell from the
sky, half of his midsection blown away, the rest of it a seared
ruin. Raditz dove after him, hurling blast after blast at the horribly
wounded demon, burning away chunks of chaotic flesh.
<p>
Deputy crashed into the quarry, falling on the wide ledge of one of
the upper levels of the excavation. It did not move.
<p>
Raditz hovered above, waiting and gasping for breath, too tired to
hurl another blast. Was it enough?  Had he damaged the creature beyond
healing? And what were the other demons doing?

&lt;PICCOLO!&gt; Gohan's thoughts shrieked in the Namek's head as he flew in
fast pursuit of Goku.
<p>
&lt;What is it, kid?&gt; The overtone of fear in Gohan's thought worried
Piccolo.
<p>
&lt;Tell Dad--Goten's disappeared! I'm coming up to join you, we've got
to find him, too!&gt;
<p>
"Goku!"
<p>
Goku slowed, and turned to face Piccolo. "What is it?" he asked
cheerily. His face turned to concern as Piccolo told Goku what Gohan
had passed to him.
<p>
"Chi-chi is probably crazy with worry," the world's most powerful hero
said. "I should stop and tell her I'm looking for Goten, too."
<p>
"Gohan already did," Piccolo said.
<p>
Another streak of fire rose from the ground as Gohan darted up to join
his father and his sensei in their journey to the gates of Hell.

<p>
Scout looked up, his task complete; the void was ready for a
sacrifice. What was all the fuss? Oh. The special victims and the
sacrifice had all vanished. The raptor-demon flared its nostrils; too
many smells, but the woman Bulma and the boy Trunks were still nearby,
he was sure of that. Didn't the Defender-of-Temples who had plagued
Enforcer have the power of invisibility? Hmm...
<p>
&lt;Lord Enforcer!&gt;
<p>
&lt;What?&gt; growled the larger demon through their mental link.
<p>
&lt;The sacrifice is invisible--but doubtless still bound. She must be
nearby, great one.&gt;
<p>
A wordless growl of acknowledgement echoed in Scout's head. Enforcer
swung his head this way and that, baring his shark-teeth; yes, he
could smell the spicy tang of the Defender-of-Temples, and the rich
sweetness of the others. They were here.
<p>
"Sorceror! They are invisible! Feel on your hands and knees if you can
do no better, but FIND THEM!" Enforcer snarled.
<p>

<p>
Sinhika's bonds parted, and she rolled around, taking the knife from
Bulma. With two deft slashes, she freed her feet and Bulma's hands,
only to be interrupted by the antelope-horned broo groping about under
the altar.
<p>
"Don't move!" Sinhika hissed at Bulma. "Don't scream, don't do
anything. They won't see, feel or hear anything I don't want them to,
but you've got to keep still and not do anything surprising to
me--even an idiot like Voron will figure something's up if the ground
gets up and runs screaming away!"
<p>
Bulma nodded, and froze as the broo crawled over her. His hands roamed
over her body, and she couldn't help shuddering as the beastman patted
her breasts and face before crawling on. She bit back a cry as the
broo planted a knee in her stomach as it moved off of her and onto
Sinhika.
<p>
Sinhika wrinkled her nose in disgust, but did not move as the bestial
demon crawled blindly over her, fondling her thighs and nearly poking
a finger in her left eye in passing.
<p>
"Yecch!" she muttered. It was nearly their undoing.  Distracted by the
broo, Sinhika did not see Enforcer's massive foot come down on Trunks'
leg--
<p>
"AAAAAHHHH!" Trunks' scream got everyone's attention; Enforcer growled
something, and a sickly green corona sprang from the altar, the ground
and other unmoving objects nearby. Sinhika went white, biting her lip
hard as something battered her will, breaking the illusion--
<p>
Only for a moment, but long enough for Enforcer to see Trunks and
pluck him up, as a child casually plucks up a dandelion. Enforcer
growled with anticipation--
<p>
WHAAM! Something slammed into the great shadow demon's left knee,
shattering it, and it stumbled, dropping Trunks as it collapsed to one
knee. Raditz hovered above the monster, snarling; then he dove,
driving a double-handed blow into the top of Enforcer's skull.
<p>
"Oh, crap!" Voron dove out of the way as Enforcer crashed headlong,
stumbled, picked himself up and kept running.
<p>
"Here! That bastard's mine!" Sinhika shoved knife hilt-first into
Bulma's hands, and sped after Voron, flying barely chest-high across
the ground. Bulma tumbled over the altar, throwing herself across
Trunks semi-conscious body--
<p>
Only to strike the ground hard, knocking the breath out of
her. Someone had snatched Trunks out from under her as she fell; Bulma
looked up--
<p>
The dinosaur-demon Scout tittered at her, and flew away with fast
beats of its narrow wings, Trunks cradled in its skinny arms.
Something grabbed Bulma around the waist and lifted her up--
<p>
"EEEEEEEE!" Bulma screamed in pure terror as the ground receded--
<p>
"Damn it, woman! Stop trying to burst my eardrums!" Raditz's familiar
voice growled. "Here," he dropped Bulma on an upper-level ramp next to a
puzzled Goten, "sit there and stay out of trouble! I've got some
demons to kill!" With a flash of light and rush of air, he was gone
again.
<p>
Goten blinked at her. "Nan Bulma okay?"  As she sat there in silent
shock, the little boy ran up and hugged her.
<p>
"I think," she said a bit shakily, "I'm okay." Bulma hugged the little
boy back, and sighed, patting her nightshirt down. Somehow the short
dress-like garment had survived the night's ordeals reasonably intact,
if filthy. "Am I glad I wasn't wearing one of my negligees!"

<p>
Raditz hurtled across the quarry toward Scout; the demon dinosaur
looked behind, turning his head on his long supple neck. It screeched,
and flung its wings wide as Raditz closed; in a sudden move, it flung
Trunks down into the pit, and flitted away in another direction.
<p>
"DAMN YOU!" Raditz dove, catching the half-conscious boy just before
he hit the quarry floor. Back again, and Trunks was deposited gently
at his mother's feet. Raditz flashed away before Bulma could do more
than open her mouth.
<p>
"Now," growled Raditz, "there's no one I want alive in the way." He
grinned, watching Enforcer crawl to one knee--
<p>
"WHAT THE--?" A bolt of fire streaked from the rim of the quarry,
striking the great shadow demon full in the chest--
<p>
BOOOOM! The demon exploded; when the smoke cleared, Enforcer was
sprawled across the altar, a huge hole blasted through his torso--much
like his parent demon Deputy. What was left of the shadow demon
twitched feebly.
<p>
Raditz's head snapped around. That bolt came from where he'd left
Nezumi!  In a streak of white fire he was there, hovering above the
rim of the quarry--it was Nezumi!
<p>
The Capsule Corp security guard grinned jauntily up at him as she
hoisted a second rocket launcher. "I know you said to leave the
fighting to you, but I couldn't resist the fun! Especially when
someone left all these naughty toys lying around!"
<p>
Raditz tossed his hair back, and grinned. Gods! He was definitely
beginning to appreciate these Earth women! "Just stay out of reach of
the big guys--I don't need to be rescuing you, too." he growled.
<p>
Nezumi smirked as she flipped up the sight on the new launcher and
lined it up on her target. "Mrs. O'Neill didn't raise any stupid kids,
Raditz! Think the big guy will go down as easy as the shadow oni did?"
<p>
"The big guy?" Raditz paled and whirled, looking back into the
quarry.
<p>
Deputy arose like a phoenix, wings spread, newly healed flesh
glistening with slime. He giggled as the mighty legs tensed, then
pushed off, rising into the air with slow flaps of his great wings,
flying with deliberate leisure toward the ledge where Bulma, Trunks
and Goten waited.
<p>
"Oh, crap!" the long-haired Saiyan glanced back at Nezumi. "Don't try
it, he's too tough, and you do NOT want to draw his attention! Keep
the other bastard down--he heals fast."
<p>
Raditz zoomed down, slamming hard into Deputy's right wing joint. The
bone buckled, forcing Deputy to land awkwardly on the nearest
ledge. The demon hissed at Raditz.
<p>
"Fool! You cannot kill me--wound me, and I will heal, my strength
ever-renewed by Chaos! You," it snarled as it stalked back and forth
on the ledge, watching Raditz while its wing unbuckled, the bones
setting themselves and knitting as the warrior watched, "you are weak
from fighting me. How long before you tire? How long before I taste
your blood?"
<p>
Two more streaks of fire slashed down from the rim of the quarry into
the pit.
<p>
"Let's see you heal from dust and ashes!" Raditz growled.
<p>
Brave talk, but not likely to happen, he worried to himself. My
options are pretty limited. I can't go Ouzaru here--it's too confined;
I'm as likely to kill Bulma, Nezumi or Sinhika in my rampage as the
demons. If I could have destroyed him with my normal strength, I would
have already--I dumped most of my power I had into finishing him
off. After last time, I knew he could regenerate--that's why I hung
onto enough energy to fly and fight a bit. But now what?  There's only
one real possiblity left...

<p>
Voron screamed as Sinhika descended on him, claws extended. For the
first and last time in his life, he saw her as she really was.
<p>
A minute later, Sinhika retrieved the rest of her blades from Voron's
bloody corpse, and wiped them off on the liner of his trench coat. Two
blanks of spring steel, forged into a pair of short swords with
wire-wrapped hilts--Sinhika was proud of her handiwork--Industrial Age
swords.
<p>
"Now, where'd that little demon go?  And Bulma, for that matter?"

Later, back in Satan City, Sean had his own questions...
<p>
"What do you want?" Sean asked, scared and angry. His hand crept
toward the axe handle leaning against the wall.
<p>
"I want the artist who painted <i>that</i>," the white-cloaked demon
indicated.
<p>
"I don't know who you're talking about," Sean said defiantly, his
black hair drooping into his eyes again. "Why do want this guy,
anyway?"
<p>
The demon snarled. "Idiot! Do I look like a fool to you?" He waved his
hand, and Sean's paints and brushes lept from the floor to crash
against the wall. "Is the artist you, or your companion?"
<p>
"My companion?" Sean stared blankly at the spiky-haired demon, then he
noticed Sinhika's jacket still tossed over the back of his couch,
behind the demon. Oh crud, Sean thought to himself, he thinks Sinhika
lives here and might be the artist!
<p>
Sean's muscles tensed, "I'm the artist. What do you want?"
<p>
The demon smirked. "You."
<p>
Before Sean could move, he found himself slammed against the wall and
held there in a grip of iron, the demon's hand against his throat. The
demon brought his face close to Sean's.
<p>
"You made quite a nuisance of yourself, opening this gate into Hell--a
gate that should not exist! Such things are forbidden! I'm here to
make sure this gate gets closed, and never re-opened--too bad there's
only one way to do that," he sneered.
<p>
"Urk!" was all Sean could say with the hand around his throat. He
grabbed at the being's wrists, intending to pry them loose-- to his
horror, all he grabbed was thin air. The goth artist brought his knee
up, aiming for the primary target--and hit nothing at all.
<p>
The demonic warrior scowled, and Sean found himself crashing into the
opposite wall after being thrown across the room.
<p>
"Uhhhhnnn." He picked himself up painfully. "You're not real!"
<p>
"Real enough for you. We're spirits from Hell, what did you expect?
Flesh and blood is the prerogative of the living." An odd bitterness
twisted the hell-warrior's voice.
<p>
Sean wiped his mouth, and stared at the blood on his hand for a
moment. "Wonderful." His voice was flat. "I'm about to be murdered by
a poltergeist from Hell who doesn't like my art."
<p>
"No," said the demon commander. "You're about to be <i>executed</i>; you'd
already be dead if this were just a killing." He picked up Sean and
held him at arm's length, casually. "As such, there are certain
formalities--that's why I bothered to tell you all this, instead of
just snapping your neck."
<p>
"Can't you just take my word that I'll never paint again?" To his
horror and shame, Sean realized he was pleading for his life.
<p>
The demon commander smirked again. "Haven't you painted pictures like
this before?"
<p>
The look on Sean's face was all the answer the demon commander needed.
<p>
"As long as you live, you could open a gate like this one again--a
forbidden doorway! I'm solving that problem right now!"
<p>
Kale's hand closed around Sean's throat..

<p>
Sometime earlier, at the quarry, Deputy stretched his wings and yawned
lazily.  He pushed off from the ledge, and with a snap of his wings
was airborne once again.
<p>
"Enough of this!" Deputy yawned again, and belched fire--not at
Raditz, but across the quarry toward Bulma and the kids! Raditz's eyes
widened, and he dove in front of the blast, deflecting it away with
one swift blow.  The long-maned Saiyan warrior gasped for breath
afterwards.
<p>
Only one possibility left--little brother, I hoped I learned well what
you tried to teach me, or this will kill me faster than that monster!
Focus...
<p>
"KAI-O KEN!"
<p>
Red flame enveloped Raditz as his power exploded around him, doubled
and restored. The whole quarry shook as the red power seethed around
him; marble dust filled the air; marble splintered and fell from the
quarry walls.
<p>
"WHAT?" Deputy's blazing scarlet eyes widened; the demon drove at
Raditz, teeth bared and claws outstretched.
<p>
Raditz disappeared; the next thing Deputy felt was a massive blow to
the back of his skull, breaking his spine and crushing his
brainstem. Paralyzed, the great demon fell, crashing into the middle
of the pit atop his panicking followers.
<p>
"MAN-KI-BATSU!" Once again, the fearsome violet-edged beam smashed
down, obliterating Deputy's head and chest, exploding in a shower of
fire and shrapnel-like marble shards. As the smoke cleared, Raditz
hurled blast after blast into the shredded remnants of the great
demon's body.
<p>
Raditz descended to hover just above the fallen demon. Behind him, a
pickup truck sped up the quarry ramps, taking corners on two wheels as
someone tried desperately to escape the carnage below. Another streak
of fire darted from the rim of the quarry, and the truck exploded in a
ball of gasoline-fueled fire.
<p>
Grinning fiercely, Raditz held one hand out, palm flat. "BURNING
ATTACK!" A great plume of fire flared out to envelope what was left of
Deputy.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Sinhika hovered over the rim of the quarry. Where was that other
demon? He had a talent for hiding--there!
<p>
Scout flitted and hopped from level to level, his gleaming white hide
blending in with the marble walls, his path aiming him steadily at
Bulma and the children.
<p>
"Oh no you don't!" snarled Sinhika as she darted down toward the
speedy demon. It was nearly on them when she caught up with the winged
raptor and slashed across its back--
<p>
--and missed. Scout dodged with the preternatural speed that was his
trademark, whipping his tail back and across Sinhika's face. She
reeled back for a moment, blood running from her broken nose--time
enough for Scout to dive and grab a child in each arm.
<p>
Bulma shrieked and grabbed for the demon's leg as it flew off--too
slow; she missed and fell screaming into the pit below. Sinhika
hurtled downward, grabbing Bulma's arm with her left hand. For a
moment, they hung there in mid-air, Bulma shaking uncontrollably,
Sinhika breathing hard.
<p>
"You can fly, too," Bulma said, amazed.
<p>
"All my kind can," Sinhika answered. She gently set Bulma down on the
nearest ledge. "Wait here, I've got to stop that thing!"
<p>
"Hey!" Bulma yelped in surprise as the orange-haired demon girl
vanished from sight. Then she saw the dinosaur-demon--it headed
unerringly for the churning void over the altar, Trunks and Goten
clutched in its arms. "Oh, no!" Bulma moaned, terror nearly freezing
her tongue.
<p>
"RADITZ! Stop him!" she finally screamed.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz smirked as the greasy remnants of Deputy smoked and
burned--then Bulma's frantic scream reached his ears. His eyes widened
in horror, and he hurtled toward the demon Scout with all his
speed. As he flew, Raditz flung a single blast ahead of him, aiming at
the churning void.
<p>
Deflected by the twisted reality around the void, his beam struck the
blood-stained altar, shattering it into a thousand shards of marble
rubble. The void still churned, hovering over the smoking crater.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"Piccolo! Gohan!" Goku yelped, "I can sense Raditz now! See you
there!" He put two fingers to his forehead, and vanished in a streak
of light.
<p>
"Dad!" Gohan yelled with dismay, "Where is he?"
<p>
"Don't worry, Gohan!" Piccolo yelled back, "I can sense him, too. It's
not far!"
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Blazing steel slashed out of thin air, biting deep into Scout's left
wing. Scout screeched and rolled over on his back, lashing up with the
great gutting claw that was the heritage of his demon-raptor
form. There was a brief cry, and Sinhika appeared, plummeting toward
the ground, She hit with a thud, and lay with both arms wrapped around
her stomach.  Blood poured over her fingers.
<p>
The wounded demon windmilled awkwardly to the ground near the
shrieking void, one wing dangling useless. Trunks hung limply from
under one arm, still only half-conscious; Goten wiggled and yelled,
but could not free himself from the demon's grip. Scout hopped closer
to the void.
<p>
"KAIO-KEN TIMES TWO!" Red fire cloaked Raditz as he shot across the
quarry-- one hand grabbed the dinosaur-demon's tail--
<p>
--A sudden flicker as Goku appeared above the battlefield--
<p>
--With a sudden effort, Scout threw Trunks and Goten toward the void,
even as Raditz's other hand came slashing down, shattering Scout's
spine and tearing into the dinosaur-demon's heart.
<p>
"NOOOOOOO!" Raditz wrenched his gory hand loose from Scout's back and
lunged for Goten and Trunks as they plunged into the shrieking void--
<p>
--and vanished with the void. Raditz plunged through the empty air
where the void had been, and crashed hard into the back wall of the
quarry pit. Silence fell like darkness at the flick of a switch, like
a knife into Raditz's heart. The void was gone. Trunks was gone. Goten
was gone.

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Edge">XXVI. EDGE OF ANNIHILATION</A></H1>
<p>
Vegeta swooped low over the broken hills, hurtling toward the dark
border beyond. He swerved abruptly; he'd already learned to avoid the
things that hung like puffs of lace in the sky.  The Saiyan prince
couldn't have said what they <i>were</i>, but they weren't clouds. Clouds
didn't wrap lacy tendrils covered with acid around one's body and try
to devour it, and clouds didn't reek of that particular foulness
Vegeta knew too well from Cacodemon and his broo.
<p>
The stolen knowledge in the back of Vegeta's mind whispered "sky
gorp", but Vegeta ignored it. It was just a label, it didn't tell him
much. There were other labels from Zorak Zoran's knowledge--the dark
god had a label for everything, and a response to go with each
label. Apparently the mad god didn't think much--he just assigned a
label to something, and reacted, like some programmed android. Vegeta
had been tagged with the label "sky/sun god", with the stock reaction
"kill from ambush"--so much for labels.
<p>
Hmmm.. Vegeta considered the power he had stolen from the dark god--a
cold, familiar power that sliced soul from body, leaving a lifeless
shell behind. The Death rune, the dark god's knowledge labeled
it. Hadn't he always held that power?
<p>
Vegeta looked within; what other powers that were already his did this
eldritch place give name and form?  The furious power that was his
heritage, the fire that burned within--yes. The rune of Fire. And the
other power that was his heritage, the heritage of every Saiyan under
a full moon?  The Beast rune. And arching over and behind them all,
tying them together--the rune of Mastery.
<p>
It still seemed that something was missing, but Vegeta couldn't quite
determine what that element was. Bah! It mattered not--only one thing
mattered, and that was the key to Cacodemon's destruction! Somewhere
in the depths of Chaotic Hell, where Chaos seeped in and gnawed at the
foundations of the universe, the Prince of the Saiyajin would find the
bearer of that key, and take it for his own.
<p>
Mottled, partly luminous vegetation shrouded the broken, twisted hills
now--some branched and filigreed fungus that almost looked like trees;
the foul sky gorp were clustering now, forcing Vegeta to fly lower to
avoid them or detour widely around them. He chose to fly lower, toward
the dark border still in the distance.
<p>
Things scuttled and crawled in the phosporescent forest; Vegeta
ignored them--their powers were too weak to be the ones he
sought. Occasionally he would sense a foulness that reminded him of
the great Chaos demon he meant to destroy; those the Saiyan prince did
not ignore, but tossed a single destructive blast at as he
passed. This happened less and less as he flew, because the land
itself became increasingly tainted with foulness, overwhelming any
sense of lesser individuals.
<p>
He passed over a great black river that tumbled white over rocks and
the broken bones of gods; there was no foulness here--the river washed
it all clean as it headed for the dark shore in the distance.  The
river looped and turned; Vegeta flew straight, cutting the curves and
heading for the sea. A strange shore greeted his night-canny eyes; a
barren beach ringed by bleak, twisted cliffs, lapped by a sluggish,
viscid sea. The sense of foulness nearly overwhelmed him as he hovered
over the barren seascape. Nothing moved, save the waves as they
slapped the etched, seared rocks.
<p>
A strange uneasiness settled over Vegeta; there was something <i>wrong</i>,
very wrong about this place. He noted details; the rocks that were
etched and half-melted as if by some powerful acid, the strange
<i>sucking</i> noise the waves made as they slithered back into the sea,
the barren sand on which nothing moved, not crab nor sand louse nor
shorebird, the trees on the cliffs above that moved with no wind...
<p>
"<i>Nani</i>?" Beneath him, a wave stood still and bulged upward--
<p>
"<i>KUSO</i>!" Vegeta dodged upwards, surrounded by the white flame of his
power as a huge slimy pseudopod exploded upward from the "sea", groped
blindly through the air where he'd been, and then crashed back into
the "sea" with a wet "plop".
<p>
The Saiyan prince's eyes widened. "That's not the sea!" What he'd
taken for the sea was an immensely huge protoplasmic <i>thing</i>, a
monstrous basin of acidic slime endowed by Chaos with hideous
life. "Gorp," he muttered, applying Zorak Zoran's label for
the.. thing.
<p>
Vegeta flew along the "coast" until he saw the black river coursing
down to the "sea". He hovered, watching, his eyes widening as the
churning river water struck the slimy sea-gorp-thing and tore into it,
washing great chunks of protoplasm away--only to be smothered as more
slimy goo flowed in to fill the gaps.
<p>
"<i>Kuso</i>!" he snarled to himself. "Is <i>this</i> what that damned demon
intends for Earth? My Earth--MY WORLD??" Power seethed around him in
answer to the rage that shook the fierce prince. "NEVER!"
<p>
Hair blazed golden as the fury shook him, and burst forth in a
brilliant orb of fire, streaking down into the slime sea. Explosion!
-- the swelling detonation spread and spread, consuming everything
from horizon to horizon.  Vegeta rose high, high above the great
fireball, feeding energy into it until at last his fury was slaked.
<p>
Vegeta trembled as the smoke cleared; he'd spent far too much energy
in a pointless gesture of rage. Or perhaps not.. he smirked at the
sight below.
<p>
A deep basin of blasted rock lay where the gorp-sea had been,
stretching as far as he could see. The spreading blast had reached up
the shore cliffs and burnt the nameless forest black for miles;
nothing moved, save the billowing clouds of steam where the black
river poured unopposed into the deep basin. The overwhelming foulness
was gone.
<p>
Vegeta's smirk turned into a satisfied smile; in time, there would be
a <i>real</i> sea here. "Time to go. I've things to do."  He turned, and
flew along the shore toward a distant power that beckoned him, and the
foulness that opposed it.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Prince Khara also flew, but this time on another's wings--with far
more difficulty than expected.
<p>
"Please explain to me <i>why</i> all flights to Satan City have been
cancelled," the aloof Prince demanded of the airline's agent. He'd
made it as far as Shanghai, only to find out that his previously
scheduled flight was unexpectedly cancelled. Prince Khara had no
servants to arrange matters for him now; once he'd left Beautiful
Lankha, the mission was his alone.
<p>
The pretty girl behind the counter blinked at the aristocratic young
Indian. "Haven't you heard about the earthquake? The city is a
disaster area!"
<p>
"Ah. I see," the dusky prince nodded. "Arrange a flight to the nearest
city to Satan City," he ordered.
<p>
"That would be-- yes, the airport is open--all right. Flight 437 to
the Southern Capital is departing in an hour, sir."
<p>

<p>
Vegeta crested a ridge, noting the solitary figure standing atop it,
looking down into the valley ahead.  He slowed to a hover, regarding
it suspiciously--it didn't run like the small bands of broo Vegeta had
obliterated on his way. He didn't sense that foulness,
either. What--or who?  He dropped lower, trying to get a good look.
<p>
The figure finally stirred, leaping to its feet--obviously noticing
Vegeta for the first time.  It was an extremely lean--no,
skeletal--person, and it brandished a spear. Something familiar about
that stance... Modgudh!
<p>
Vegeta dropped down to face the skeletal warrior maid.
<p>
"--took you long enough to get here," she interrupted before he could
do more than open his mouth. "I think I've been sitting here for a
week!"
<p>
"What?? Woman, what are you talking about, and how did you know I
would come here?"
<p>
"It's one of the important hero-paths through the Chaos Hells;
everyone who fights Chaos comes this way. You're fighting Chaos,
therefore..." She shrugged at the obviousness of it. "What took you so
long, anyway?"
<p>
Vegeta did not answer at first, but stared hard at her. There were
changes--the dead guardian now carried a large round shield, and a
steel-headed spear, marked with the runes of Air and Fire. Sparks
crackled off the tip, and the glow of St. Elmo's fire surrounded the
whole spear.
<p>
"Nice toy.. Where'd you get it?"
<p>
"I diced for it while you and Zorak Zoran were breaking the rocks with
each other's heads." The naked bones of her face did not show any
expression, but there was a certain tone of smug satisfaction in her
voice. "That, and some information."
<p>
"You WHAT??" Vegeta's eyebrows arched with incredulity.
<p>
Her deep chuckle echoed within her hollow skull. "I thought that would
get your attention. I played knucklebones with Orlanth--the god of Air
and Storm--for the Lightning Spear." She hefted the weapon in
question. "He was not so sore a loser when he learned that I needed it
to fight Chaos; Air is a great enemy of Chaos in this place."
<p>
A sly hint of a smile quirked the corner of Vegeta's mouth. "Whose
knucklebones did you dice with?"
<p>
"Mine, of course."
<p>
Vegeta's smile turned into a knowing smirk. "You cheated."
<p>
"Of course. This gamble was too important to lose." Vegeta couldn't
see the smirk on her face, but he could hear it in her voice.
<p>
"And the shield?"
<p>
"A trade--my powers as bridge guardian for the power of the
shield. Since I don't have a bridge to guard anymore, it seemed a good
deal." She tilted her skull and regarded him with empty eye
sockets. "You really don't know this is the hero-path, do you?  What
did you do, just stumble on this place by luck?"
<p>
"Of course not!" Vegeta growled. "So--you can trade powers here, as
well as take them in combat! That might be.. useful." He looked down
into the valley, the well-worn hero-path now apparent to his
sight. Far below, in the darkness, something monstrous crouched with
many legs beside the path.
<p>
Vegeta's eyebrows arched downward. "Another waste of time and
energy--but I have to go past it! Damn this!" He leaped high and
plunged into the valley, Modgudh scrambling down the steep path after
him.
<p>
Vegeta's power blazed around him, dispelling the pitch darkness of the
valley floor. A monstrous scorpion--no, not a scorpion, but a
nightmarish combination of woman and scorpion scuttled forward
gripping a club in both hands.  The creature was a horrid centaur with
the lower portion of a scorpion and the head and chest of a woman--an
ugly, bloated woman with very sharp teeth. She stood nearly twelve
feet tall on six legs; darkness gathered at her feet.
<p>
Vegeta grinned evilly at the monster, craning his neck to look
up. "Run."
<p>
The scorpion woman hissed, and raised her club as if to strike--and
then scuttled quickly backwards.  She flicked her legs, dancing in
pools of darkness--darkness that suddenly welled up and flowed over
Vegeta and Modgudh!
<p>
Darkness. Silence. Cold. Terror--no, the ghost of fear long since laid
to rest. Vegeta drew the wolfskin cloak close around him, and snarled
soundlessly--he knew this darkness!
<p>
"Zorak Zoran himself couldn't defeat me this way, fool!" He lashed out
in the direction he'd last seen the scorpion-creature--and nearly fell
on his face as the ground disappeared out from under him.  A
staircase, and he landed some way down it, still smothered in
darkness.
<p>
He let his power blaze around him, searing and stripping away the
darkness that sought to quench it, until with a hiss it withered
away. Vegeta looked around; in the darkness he'd somehow blundered
into a cave, and halfway down a staircase. Modgudh crouched above him
on the stair, spear ready.
<p>
"Well?" Vegeta demanded imperiously, "don't just stand there like an
idiot! You're not scared of the dark, are you?" With that, he decended
the stair.
<p>
Modgudh chuckled. "I outgrew <i>that</i> a very long time ago. Death,
darkness and the tomb are not exactly strangers to me..."
<p>
Vegeta paused and turned to look up and down her skeletal form. He
simply smirked, and continued down the stairs.
<p>
"Prince Vegeta--where are you going?"
<p>
"Down."
<p>

<p>
"Mama! What are you doing?" Princess Kadru wailed. "I'll never catch
up to him at this rate!"
<p>
"Making sure that my own daughter is properly dressed and adorned,"
Princess Snake answered calmly as she inspected the fit of Kadru's
kimono. "I never should have left you with your father--he has no
notion of what is fitting for a young lady of your class and talents!"
The blue-skinned snake goddess frowned, and shifted one of Kadru's
bejewelled hairpins an inch to the left. "There, that's better."
<p>
"But Papa did give me my bridal gold and everything--I already told
you how it got lost--"
<p>
"--and that never would have happened if Vasuki--pardon me, <i>King</i>
Vasuki--wasn't such a petty-minded idiot! If you had not been my
daughter, he would have had no trouble arranging a suitable marriage
for you--but he's still angry with me, and he took it out on you."
Princess Snake snorted in disgust. "<i>That</i> is unforgiveable!"
<p>
"MAMA! That is a terrible thing to say about Papa!"
<p>
"Nevertheless, it is true. Prince Vegeta seems to have done a better
job of finding you a suitable bridegroom in a few short weeks than
your father managed in several centuries!" The snake goddess adjusted
a few more of Kadru's hairpins. "I owe him a favor; Prince Khara of
Lankha will be an excellent match. I have already sent a messenger to
King Vibishana."  She sighed wistfully.
<p>
"Mama? What's the matter?"
<p>
"Oh, nothing, really." Princess Snake sighed again. "Why are the good
ones always taken?  First, Son Goku, now this Prince Vegeta... Ah,
well, there's always dear Enma--but he's so busy these days; we never
seem to find time for each other anymore."
<p>
"Mama.." Kadru turned away from the mirror to face her mother, a
serious expression on her face. "Perhaps you should make time. If he
does mean that much to you..." She lowered her eyes, suddenly bashful.
<p>
Princess Snake looked at her daughter, suddenly thoughtful. "You have
changed, daughter.  There is some wisdom in your words..." She looked
her daughter Kadru over one last time. "Excellent! We need not keep
the Ferryman waiting any longer; it is time for you to go to Prince
Khara."
<p>
"Thank you, Mama! I knew you would help me!" Kadru impulsively hugged
her mother.
<p>
"How could you doubt it? What else can a mother do but help her child
in time of need?"
<p>

<p>
Something dark and insatiably hungry waited below, along with a
rapidly fading power that contended with the darkness. That much
Vegeta could sense, and no more--but it was enough to speed him
downward. What if the fading power was the one Vegeta sought? He dared
not be too late.
<p>
Black wings fluttered toward them; suddenly, a swarm of wings circled
Vegeta and Modgudh, diving and striking. With every strike, Vegeta
felt a minute fraction of his power drain away.
<p>
"<i>Kuso</i>! These things are ki-vampires!" With a flurry of blows, the
Saiyan prince mangled and broke the swarm around him. He glanced
back; Modgudh fended them off repeatedly with her shield as her spear
darted and stabbed, flinging broken wings hither and yon.
<p>
"No time to waste!" Vegeta snarled, hovering in the air. He grabbed
Modgudh by one skeletal arm and hurtled down the stairway, flying with
terrifying speed down the narrow, blind-dark tunnel. Several times
they smashed through swarms of fluttering black wings, scattering them
with their sheer speed and leaving the evil spirits far behind.
<p>
Without warning, Vegeta burst into a huge dark gulf; emptiness
surrounded him.  No, not emptiness; he sensed countless thousands of
the fluttering Black Wings in the abyss around him--and somewhere
below, that hungry maleficence and the fading power on which it.. fed.
<p>
With a scream of rage, Vegeta plunged down, down into the black gulf,
towing Modgudh with him.
<p>
His light revealed the battered, bloody body of a woman held in the
grip of something dark, her pale face upturned, eyes open and
empty. She lived.. barely. Blood dripped from her torn throat--but
only a little. Red-orange hair clotted with blood spilled down. Her
power, her life was almost completely gone; only a thread remained.
<p>
Crouched over her, hold her in its grasp was something black and
hungry; red eyes burned in the darkness above sharp white
teeth. Darkness cloaked it, hiding its true face and power. The thing
hissed at Prince Vegeta.
<p>
Vegeta snarled back, "What beast are <i>you</i>?"
<p>
And how in all the hells did a living human woman get <i>here</i>? Vegeta
thought, but did not say aloud.
<p>
"Good question," Modgudh added dryly, "but it doesn't seem inclined to
answer."
<p>
"Die eternally, and feed me!" the dark monster growled, dropping his
dying victim--and leaping toward Vegeta.
<p>
Vegeta dodged the thing easily, and responded with a brutal blow to
the thing's back--and cried out! Half his power drained away at that
mere touch; the Saiyan prince swayed and nearly fell.
<p>
Unbidden, Raditz's words returned to his mind:

<p><I>"The mara drains soul force by touch--yours or its..."
</I></p>
<p><I>"So blasting the little bastard would make him stronger, would it?
And he'd steal my strength if I fought him hand-to-hand? That would be
a tricky fight.. an interesting fight! Are there other demons like
him?" Vegeta had asked.
</I></p>
<p><I>"There are.  Why do you think the Saiyajin Demon Guard--my outfit--all
carry swords?" Raditz had answered.
</I></p>
<p>
Vegeta's lips drew back in a snarl; so this is one of those <i>other</i>
soul-draining demons! Yes, it would be an.. interesting fight.
<p>
The dying, soul-drained woman on the ground stirred, murmuring, "Woe,
stranger! Look upon one who dared to face Vivamort, and see your
fate!" A single tear trickled from her right eye.
<p>
The monster laughed.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
The red ogre was not laughing; in fact, he looked distinctly
worried. As one of the two guardians of this bit of Upper Hell, he had
a job to do--no matter how painful the consequences.
<p>
"Hey! You there! Stop! You can't go that way!" The oni waved his arms
as he ran across the rocky field toward the crowd of people
approaching a certain cave.  Behind him, his partner, the blue ogre,
looked puzzled as he dug bits of clay out of his ears.
<p>
With a burst of speed, the slender red ogre darted ahead and put
himself between the oncoming group and the narrow Cave of the
Stair. He put his hands on his hips and said confidently, "You can
just turn around and go back where you came from--you're not getting
past me now that I know you're here!"
<p>
"Aw, is that so?" came a particularly loud, derisive voice. "I can really
just turn around and go all the way back?"
<p>
The red ogre hurriedly put on a bent and cracked pair of glasses,
squinting at the speaker as he did so.  The group facing him suddenly
sprang into focus. A particularly large, ugly, bald Saiyan warrior in
archaic armour, several humans, a one-eyed Saiyan warrior--and <i>eight</i>
gozu-oni faced him!
<p>
"Nappa!" The ogre's voice broke into a squeak.
<p>
The bald Saiyan smirked as he cracked his knuckles. "How 'bout I just
go <i>through</i> you instead of past you?  Or maybe <i>over</i> you?" His smirk
deepened. "We got an appointment with Lord Enma."
<p>
The red ogre gulped. Eight gozu-oni--this just might be legitimate;
the bull-headed demons were notoriously honest and would not go along
with an escape attempt... He straightened himself up. "You have the
necessary forms and passes, of course?"
<p>
Nappa's smirk changed abruptly to a scowl; he turned to the smaller
Saiyan and folded his arms. With a jerk of his head toward the red
oni, he snarled, "Take care of it!", and stood there, scowling
impatiently.
<p>
"Yes, sir!" Negi saluted Nappa, strolled over to the red ogre, and
held up two bone wands carved with characters. "Passes."
<p>
The ogre would have taken them, but Negi snatched the passes
away. "You can see them just fine from there." Next, he came up with a
scroll, and unfurled it for the ogre to read. "And you can read this
just fine from where you are, so don't go getting grabby again."
<p>
Red looked the document over, read it from beginning to end, and then
from end to beginning again. "This is highly irregular..."
<p>
"Aw, really?" Nappa's scowl brighted to a smirk again, and he resumed
cracking his knuckles.
<p>
".. but not too irregular," the ogre concluded with haste. "Go right
ahead, I wouldn't think of delaying your visit with Lord Enma!"
<p>
"Aw, pity." Nappa looked disappointed as the group filed past into the
narrow cavern entrance, four gozu-oni, Negi, the human souls, four
more gozu-oni, and finally, Nappa, looking even more disappointed.
<p>

<p>
The monster laughed; Vegeta's eyes widened as darkness rippled and
closed around the gaping wound in the creature's gut.
<p>
"Useless!" Vegeta tossed the Lightning Spear back to Modgudh with a
disdainful shrug and a snarl. "It heals faster than I can wound it
with toys like that!"
<p>
He dared not touch it--nor blast it, for like Android #19, it would
consume energy thrown at it--that left only weapons--and weapons did
too little damage.  There must be something.. Vegeta probed his stolen
memories from Zorak Zoran. What was a Vivamort?
<p>
Ah. Vivamort, Lord of Vampires, Chaos God of Dark Undeath--loathed by
everyone for his predatory ways. Vegeta noted with a smirk that he was
one of the few chaos gods so disgusting and vicious that even other
chaotics hated him.
<p>
Vivamort.. was not fond of running water--Styx hated him and had sworn
to destroy him; nor did he like Fire and Sky--it weakened and burnt
him; Earth rejected him and denied him her strength; but his worst
enemy was.. Death. Vivamort the Undead had no soul--Death, the Severer
of Spirits was utter annihilation to the dark god and his warped
children.
<p>
"So that's why you're so hungry for ki and spirit! You have none of
your own, you have to steal it!" Vegeta hissed as he dodged the evil
god. He could sense the gaping emptiness, the insatiable dark hunger
that Vivamort possessed in lieu of either soul or ki.
<p>
"I will feast on you, Sun-child," the undead god growled, sharp white
fangs bared. "Your power is my power.. now." With that, he dissolved,
leaving only swirling cloud of mist in his place.
<p>
"What the--?" Vegeta's exclamation was choked off as the mist
surrounded him, blinding him, embracing him...
<p>
..and became Vivamort once again, holding the Saiyan prince in his
dark embrace. Vegeta screamed as he felt the power draining out of his
spirit--a scream that abruptly ended in a gasp as sharp teeth bit into
his neck, bringing a dark ecstasy with them. The Saiyan moaned as the
numbing ecstasy spread through his body, filling him with a dark
pleasure like none he'd ever known before. The slow destruction of his
soul filled Vegeta with a piercing sensual delight; his one passion
was to surrender himself utterly to Vivamort's hunger.
<p>
But more than mere passion drove Vegeta--in life, in death, and
now. Even as the terrible ectasy washed over him in waves, his hand
fell to his waist, his fingertips brushing against the small wolf-skin
pouch made by Kadru. Vegeta's fingers reached in, almost of their own
volition, and drew out a tiny object. As his ghost's body shuddered
with destroying pleasure, a part of his mind embraced something
else--a cold, keen, familiar fury.
<p>
"I.." he gasped, aching with the hellish pleasure that he should not
have been able to feel, "give.. you.." his eyes rolled back in their
sockets <i>and turned black</i>, "DEATH!"  Vegeta's arm stabbed upward,
ramming Hati's great canine tooth all the way through the vampire
god's body.
<p>
Vivamort roared with pain, ripping himself away from Vegeta's
throat--a roar that rose and rose into a high-pitched shriek of
disintegration as black fire ran up Vegeta's hand and over the
impaling tooth, turning it shiny black. The shriek grew in volume
until it seemed the very stones would shatter--and stopped.
<p>
The great moon wolf's tooth dropped to the ground with a loud clatter
in the sudden silence. It was over. Death had severed from its
semblance of life the soul of one who had no soul. Of Vivamort, not
even dust remained.
<p>
Vegeta dropped to his hands and knees, trembling with exhaustion, cold
sweat pouring off him.  "<i>Chikusho</i>! He got almost all my energy!" He
sat down on the stone floor, his hand reaching almost of its own
accord for the last peach--then he stopped. "Modghud?"
<p>
The skeletal warrior maiden hovered above the broken, dying woman on
the floor; as Vegeta watched, she reached her fingertips out to touch
the other woman's fingers.  "There's nothing left of her," Modgudh
said. "Her body cannot live without the strength of her spirit, and
what is left of her spirit is too weak to survive in this hell--
<i>and I would live again</i>!"
<p>
Their fingers met--a blinding light and a desperate shriek--it was
done. Vegeta blinked; where two had been, one lay, shaking her head
and holding herself. <i>This</i> woman had long auburn hair, and reached
slowly for the spear and shield at her side.
<p>
"Modghud?" Vegeta asked again, eyebrows arched.
<p>
"No--Yes," the woman's voice answered, echoing as if two spoke as
one. "We are--I am no longer Modgudh, nor Griselda.. call
me.. Mogris." She flexed her right hand, looking at it wonderingly,
and then looked quizzically at Vegeta. "Prince Vegeta.. your armor?"
<p>
"<i>Nani</i>?" The Saiyan prince looked down at himself. His bodysuit had
darkened to black, and the formerly white armor on top had turned
blood-red, as had his gloves and boots. Only his cloak remained the
same; Hati's fur still glistened the pristine white of snow.
<p>
"These.. are the colors of Zorak Zoran," Vegeta frowned. "When I used
the Death rune--"
<p>
Mogris's head jerked up. "The Death rune! Aye, naught else would have
slain Vivamort so thoroughly." She frowned. "Know the cost, Prince
Vegeta. He who holds Death, cannot grasp Life."
<p>
Vegeta scowled silently as he drew forth the last peach and bit into
it. Once again, he fastidiously wiped the juice from his gloves after
he finished the last of the precious fruit, all the while ignoring
Mogris. At last he glanced at her as he prepared to leave.
<p>
"<i>Nani</i>?" Both of his eyebrows arched up; Mogris hovered about five
feet above the stone floor, smirking. "Since when could you fly?"
Vegeta snarled.
<p>
"She who I now am was a Master of the Air Rune," Mogris answered. A
cool breeze swirled around them. "Air, Motion, Mastery--she was a Hero
of Orlanth, and a hunter of Chaos. Flight is the least of Orlanth's
powers."
<p>
As Vegeta rose into the air, Mogris followed, borne up on a cold wind.

<p>
Zorn jumped lightly into the chariot, watching Prince Indrajit warily
as he did so. He noted in passing that this was the first time he'd
ridden in a chariot--perhaps the first time <i>any</i> Saiyan had ever
ridden in such a vehicle. (He did not know of Prince Vegeta's brief
ride in Prince Khara's chariot). Saiyans had always flown when they
wanted to go any real distance, and had had no need of vehicles.  Here
in Hell, they just jaunted--demon teleport-- when they needed to get
somewhere in a hurry.
<p>
Zorn, King's Man, former Captain of the Royal Guard, didn't need to
"get somewhere"--his orders were to watch Prince Indrajit, and deliver
orders to Bardock's team and any other Saiyajin Demon Guardsmen they
should come across.  He sighed through clenched teeth; <i>watching</i>
Indrajit was easy--he was stuck in the same chariot with him.  Zorn
edged away from him as far as he could get--which wasn't very
far. Demons made him uneasy.
<p>
"Uneasy" was an understatement; after more than two decades in Hell,
he loathed and hated the cruel monsters with a passion that rivalled
the King's hatred of Freiza. The only thing that stopped Zorn from
turning ouzaru and ripping every demon he saw into quivering shreds in
spite of the King's orders was the small fact that the Rakshasa demons
weren't truly demons of Hell. They weren't the evil, tormenting
spirits of this realm of eternal pain; they were the shades of a
mortal demon race.  Like the Saiyajin, they too were trapped in their
own hell, suffering the fruits of their own wicked deeds.
<p>
Right now Indrajit was talking to his general--Prahasta, or was it
Jumbamali?  Zorn had trouble telling the rakshasas apart; he was only
sure of lean, mighty Indrajit in his silver armor. The dead Saiyan
warrior wrapped his tail tightly about himself, scowling.
<p>
"We are ready," the Rakshasa prince finally told him; with a flick of
his reins, the demon-tigers spread their wings and pulled the chariot
aloft. An army of rakshasas flew with them, ready to face the broo
demons of Chaos--and stop them from joining Cacodemon on Earth, as
Demon King Vibishana had promised Prince Vegeta half an eternity ago.
<p>
It was the job of the Saiyajin to make sure none of the Chaos monsters
escaped back into Hell, nor returned to the unknown nether Hell that
spawned them.
<p>

<p>
The land frayed and broke apart into islands separated by swamps of
heaving slime; the air was thick with sky gorp and less nameable
things that flitted through the air; and there was neither sea nor
sky, just a grey void that sucked everything into itself. (If Goku had
been there, he would have recognized that twisting, devouring hole in
reality--but he was not, and Vegeta had never seen a deadzone).
Armies battled here, on the edge of annihilation.
<p>
Vegeta, crouching low with Mogris just behind him, thought there had
been two armies once; one of broo, and one of Uz and other chaos
enemies. Now there was.. chaos. Whole regiments vanished into the
slime when the land broke apart, or were sucked up screaming into the
sky; whole regiments sometimes appeared, vomited up out of the slime
or emerging from the earth and darkness. At the center of the largest
group of broo some.. <i>Thing</i> walked, a Thing that hurt the eyes to
look at for even a moment. Wherever it walked, armies mutated and
changed into slithering chaos horrors, and turned to follow the Thing.
<p>
"Pocharngo the Mutator," Mogris whispered in Vegeta's ear, as they
watched the unending battle from the shelter of a mostly stable rock
spur.
<p>
At the head of the largest group of Uz, the men of darkness, a mighty
Uz strode, armored and unafraid. A strange power sang around him, and
where he walked, chaos horrors collapsed, monstrous features gone,
powers stripped away, leaving only feeble beastmen bleating in terror
and fleeing from the triumphant Uz.
<p>
"Boztakang Chaosfighter," Vegeta answered, grinning fiercely. "I have
found him at last!" His grin turned to a frown of apprehension as the
Mutator's ever-growing army twisted ponderously to face Boztakang and
his Uz.
<p>
Uz changed, twisting, deforming before the Saiyan prince's very
eyes. Twisted Uz howled and loped off into the hills, abandoning the
battle; only a tiny regiment around Boztakang stood firm, unchanged by
the Mutator. Countless thousands of howling broo and less nameable
things shambled to the attack, assaulting the beleagured regiment--and
the Mutator crashed through his own hordes, straight toward Boztakang
Chaosfighter.
<p>
"NOOOOO!" Vegeta howled in rage. "Not when I am so close! IT SHALL NOT
BE! I WILL NOT ALLOW IT!" Power flared and rose within him, and rose
high into the sky.
<p>
The White Moon rose from Vegeta's hand. The Ouzaru roared its anger
and defiance.  The land shook beneath its tread; darkness fled from
the golden fire that seethed through its golden fur.
<p>
Mogris flew fast, flinging herself to one side. "Is <i>this</i> what I have
travelled with and dared to mock?"
<p>
Pocharngo the Mutator shifted its attention to this new threat and
lashed out with its power of chaotic mutation--
<p>
Boztakang Chaosfighter saw, and turned his secret power against the
Mutator--
<p>
The Ouzaru answered in a voice like thunder: "BIG BANG ATTACK!"
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Amid the smoking ruins of Chaos, Prince Vegeta faced Boztakang
Chaosfighter. The Uz stood proud and unafraid, a tall, dark muscular
creature with a long, tusked muzzle and tiny squinting eyes--much like
his brother, Jeset the Ferryman. Once again, Vegeta heard that odd
chirping sound, which he now knew to be a form of sonar.
<p>
"So be it. Your secret, for the Death rune." Vegeta allowed himself a
tiny smirk. "A profitable trade--though I lose the power of severing
souls, we both keep the other techniques we already know, and grow in
power!"  And I, he thought to himself, am well rid of this cold enemy
of Life--my life!
<p>
Boztakang grunted. "You will keep all the lesser powers you have
learned from Death--and I gain its powers for my kin." The darkness
demigod almost smiled. "Grandmother will be pleased," he rumbled.
<p>
Vegeta did not sneer--the demigod's grandmother was Kyger Litor, the
great Dark Goddess of the Uz. In this strange Time Before Time,
everyone seemed to be related to everyone else--even mad Zorak Zoran
was a very distant cousin of sorts.
<p>
For a moment, they touched, spirit to spirit, each reaching inside
himself and giving to the other the gift of his choosing. In a moment,
it was done. Freed of the burden of Death, possessing the secret of
Cacodemon's destruction, Vegeta turned away, toward Time and Life.

<p>
Raditz plunged through the empty air where the void had been, and
crashed hard into the back wall of the quarry pit. Goku sliced through
the same empty air, grasping vainly at his vanished son. Hurtling
through the air at super-saiyan speed, not even super-saiyan reactions
were fast enough--Goku barely managed to avoid crashing into Raditz as
he smashed into the quarry wall.
<p>
WHOOOOOMMM! The sheer force of Goku's impact blasted a huge
semi-circular crater in the wall of the quarry--doubling the size of
the pit, and spraying thousands of tons of marble gravel across nearby
hills. In Satan City, they felt it, but dismissed it as yet another
aftershock of the quake.
<p>
Silence reigned at the bottom of the quarry, silence broken only by
short, sharp gasps of pain from Sinhika, and the rustling of gravel as
Raditz pulled himself painfully out from under the broken quarry
wall. He turned slowly to face the shattered altar, every muscle in
flaming agony.
<p>
Goku pushed boulders of shocked marble off himself and rose into the
air, looking around. He alighted near Sinhika, his face
serious. "You're hurt pretty bad," he told her as he knelt beside the
injured Rakshasa girl. He glanced at Raditz, who nodded as he limped
slowly toward his younger brother.
<p>
"Here, eat this," Goku put a senzu bean between her lips; Sinhika
gulped it down. Her eyes widened abruptly, and she gasped.
<p>
"Hey!" She sat up suddenly, still holding her stomach; then she slowly
let go, marvelling at the unmarred flesh beneath the huge slash in her
bloody clothing. "That's much better. Thank you."
<p>
The dark-skinned demon-girl got to her feet and regarded Goku
quizzically. "I--"
<p>
"Goku!" Raditz interrupted. "Did you see-- are they-- where are Goten
and Trunks? Did you rescue them?"  The long-haired warrior held
himself close, his face drawn with pain, desperation in his eyes.
<p>
Goku looked at him, his face very serious. He slowly shook his
head. "No. They fell into that.. deadzone." He clenched his
fists. "It's my fault; I should have listened better when Piccolo gave
me your warning about the demons."
<p>
"No." Raditz collapsed to his knees, shuddering with pain, his long
hair falling around him like a cloak. "No! Not your fault. It was <i>my</i>
duty to protect them.. and I FAILED!"
<p>
"What's a deadzone?" interrupted Sinhika as she wiped and sheathed her
blades.
<p>
"Something an old enemy once created--a door into a prison of absolute
darkness," Goku answered grimly.
<p>
"Hmmph! Well, THAT was a rift into the underworld--and these
bastards," she waved her hands at the charred corpses scattered about,
"have been summoning those beast-demons from there." She indicated the
arrow-pierced corpses of the various broo.
<p>
Raditz lifted his head. "How do you know this?" Something tickled the
back of his memory, something about alien beast-demons like this...
<p>
"I saw them do it--and I know the taste of a gate to the
underworld. My people are.. rather magical. We dwell on Earth or in
the underworld as it suits us." The orange-haired demon-girl smiled at
Goku.
<p>
"You're a demon," Goku said, curious.
<p>
"Yes--but I'm not an <i>oni</i> or <i>gaki</i>," she said, naming the two
commonest demon types of the region. "I am <i>rakshasa</i>."
<p>
"--They're in Hell." Raditz interrupted, his voice flat. There was
only despair in his eyes when he looked at his younger brother.
<p>
"What? Are you sure?" Goku clenched his fists, the only hint beyond
his unsmiling face of the turmoil within.
<p>
Raditz nodded wearily. "I remembered-- the alien beast-demons. They
had just appeared in Hell when I.. left." He closed his eyes and
shuddered. "It's no place for children."
<p>
"Then we'll just have to go there and bring them back," Sinhika said
in a matter-of-fact way, as if trips to Hell were a lot like running
down to the local convenience store.
<p>
"No, not 'we'. <i>I</i> failed them. This is mine to amend--and I know only
one way to do it." Raditz rose to his feet, his face bleak. "Goku.."
the tall Saiyan staggered slightly, his seared leg muscles nearly
refusing to support him.
<p>
"Goku.. Kill me! Send me back to Hell, and I'll find the kids. You
HAVE to do it! I won't defend myself--and you have more than enough
power even if I did. Please! It's the only way."
<p>

<p>
"There they are!" Gohan pointed down into the huge quarry pit; Piccolo
nodded. "There's Dad, and Raditz, and I can't see who else--"
<p>
"HEY! GOHAN! GET ME DOWN FROM HERE!" Bulma jumped up and down, waving
wildly from her ledge.  On the quarry rim, another small figure jumped
up and down and yelled, trying to get some attention.
<p>
"You get Bulma, I'll get the other one," Piccolo instructed his
favorite (and only) student. "So that wretched Saiyajin managed to
survive again?" He shook his head as he swooped down to the indignant
girl on the quarry rim.
<p>
"Yikes! Who are you?" Nezumi squeaked as Piccolo scooped her up and
plummeted down into the quarry pit.
<p>

<p>
Goku stared at Raditz in silent horror as Bulma and Gohan dropped to
the ground beside him.
<p>
"WHERE'S TRUNKS??" Bulma yelled, looking around. Fear filled her
eyes. "Raditz, tell me! Where's Trunks?" she begged.
<p>
"Dad, where's Goten?" Gohan asked, his voice tense with worry.
<p>
Raditz looked away, unable to face Bulma. "GOKU! Please.. You'd be
doing me a favor."
<p>
"Do what, Dad?" Gohan asked, puzzled. Goku remained silent.
<p>
"RADITZ!" Bulma yelled. "Tell me where Trunks is--Oh no." Fear turned
to dread certainity before Raditz could answer. "No, oh please no! Not
Trunks, too!" Bulma sank to her knees, tears filling her eyes. "He's
dead, isn't he?"
<p>
"I don't know--he might still be alive," Raditz finally
spoke. "But.. he's in Hell."
<p>
Gohan turned white. "And Goten?" His lip trembled, and the boy
clenched his fists.
<p>
Raditz nodded. "With Trunks, wherever that is."
<p>
"My baby's in Hell?" Bulma held herself. "NOOOOOOOO!" Deep sobs
wracked her; Sinhika held the distraught blue-haired woman.
<p>
"GOKU! DO IT! Please!" Raditz cried out. "It's the only way!"
<p>
"Do what?" Gohan asked again.
<p>
"There must be some other way!" Goku finally said, anguish in his
voice. "The Dragonballs--"
<p>
"No time!" Raditz snarled. "I will not leave innocent children in Hell
as the price of my life! I have been there, Kakarott--and I would pay
<i>any</i> price to get them out of it! I <i>will</i> pay the price, I <i>will</i> go
to them and do whatever it takes to get them back--now DO IT! Send me
back to Hell! KILL ME!"
<p>
"It might work," Piccolo spoke up as he dropped in with Nezumi. He
stared at Raditz. "You have changed, Raditz" the Namek admitted with a
certain grudging respect. "But you are still a bastard for trying to
make your own brother kill you." Piccolo curled his lip back, baring
one fang. "I will spare Son Goku that grief, and take care of you
myself."  So saying, the green warrior raised two fingers to his
forehead in a gesture all too familiar to Raditz.
<p>
Raditz's brows arched downward in anger; he scowled, clenching his
fists--then forced them open again, his expression changing to bleak
resignation.
<p>
"Piccolo--wait!" Goku said.
<p>
"NO WAY!" Nezumi jumped in front of Raditz, blocking him with her
body. "Are you people all insane?? I am NOT letting you kill Raditz!"
<p>
Raditz blinked. "What?"
<p>
Sinhika's eyes widened with recognition. "Kakarott? Son Goku is
'Kakarott'?" she muttered to herself.
<p>
"Gohan, take this girl and Bulma and leave. They don't need to see
this," Piccolo growled.
<p>
"No," Goku said firmly. "It won't work."
<p>
"What??" chorused Piccolo and Raditz. Gohan looked from one to the
other, almost as confused as they were.
<p>
Nezumi glared at Piccolo, arms folded.  "My name is Nezumi, not 'this
girl'," she muttered.
<p>
Goku looked intently at Raditz. "I don't think you'd go to Hell this
time.. big brother."
<p>
Raditz's shoulders slumped, and he sighed. "You just might be
right--and mother would agree with you."  Comprehension dawned on
Gohan's face.
<p>
"'This time'?" Nezumi wondered.
<p>
"There is another way," Sinhika spoke up. Everyone turned to stare at
her. Bulma looked up, her face streaked with tears, desperate hope in
her eyes.
<p>
"What?" Raditz demanded. He started to step forward, then winced as
fresh pain ripped through him.
<p>
"You're hurt!" Goku was surprised.
<p>
"I went too far with Kaioken," Raditz answered abruptly.
<p>
"Kaioken! I didn't think you were ready for that! You were lucky to
survive!" Goku marvelled, and tossed a senzu at Raditz.
<p>
"The first Kaioken was okay--I got hurt when I tried Kaioken times
two." Raditz caught the magic bean and winced, rubbing his sore right
shoulder; the motion unfortunately aggravated his sore left
shoulder. He quickly ate the bean.
<p>
Goku's jaw dropped. "You tried Kaioken times TWO??"
<p>
"HOW ARE WE GOING TO RESCUE MY BABY?" Bulma screamed, unable to
endure Goku's digression.
<p>
"I know another.. gate into Hell, and it is nearby," Sinhika said,
getting to her feet.
<p>
"Why didn't you mention this earlier?" Raditz snarled.
<p>
"It took until now to remember the Mantra of Opening, without which
this 'gate' is merely a door for disembodied spirits, nothing
more. <i>I</i> know the spell to open it for the living." Sinhika smiled
fiercely.
<p>
The ghost of hope glimmered in Raditz's eyes. "Lead us to it, then."
As Sinhika rose into the air, he turned to Bulma, only to find that
his brother Goku already carried her in his arms. Nezumi cleared her
throat, and looked at Raditz expectantly. The big Saiyan picked her
up, and they departed, leaving only the dead behind.
<p>
Most of the dead, that is--Voron's corpse was nowhere to be seen.
<p>

<p>
Ki blasts refracted off of glittering mirror-scales; the Captain of
Ragnaglar howled with delight and leaped forward.  His slashing claws
missed the agile Toma, but the leap moved the chaos demon another few
yards closer to his goal.
<p>
"Persistant, isn't he?" Celipa yelled to Toma, who had just dodged the
demon again.
<p>
"Too persistant! Anything he wants this bad, I do NOT want to give
him!" Toma yelled back.
<p>
"Neither do I! Toma, Celipa, fall back and guard the other side of the
vortex--and DON'T LOOK UP! I want some of us still thinking straight!"
Bardock grinned fiercely at the big demon, and flung a glowing white
sphere into the non-sky of Hell. "Totepo, Panboukin--THIS ONE'S OURS!"
<p>
The two large Saiyans and Bardock looked up at the artificial moon...

<p>
Something that was dead and yet still moved limped slowly along the
gravel service road. His enemies flew toward Satan City on the wings
of their own power; <i>he</i> had no such power to spare. Fortunately, most
of the vehicles that had been parked above the quarry were still
intact and driveable. One of them might even match one of the sets of
keys he'd looted from the charred corpses below; if not, well, he knew
how to hotwire a car.
<p>
Glowing crimson eyes glanced in the direction of the city; he'd catch
up to his enemies soon enough. Then.. ah, yes, then! Dead lips drew
back in a hideous smile; he would have laughed, but he had no lungs
left.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
WHAAAAAMMMM! The vortex exploded in a flash of blinding light as its
creator died. The very canyons of Hell cracked and shattered at the
touch of that unthinkable concussion; monsters found themselves tossed
and scattered from one end of Hell to the other.  The ouzaru standing
over the crushed remains of something with mirrored scales tumbled
head over heels, and were flung sprawling, dazzled and half-deafened
into the canyons.
<p>
At the center of the destruction, in a field of broken, flattened
rubble, two small figures held on to each other.
<p>
"Truuunks! I'm scared!" Goten locked his arms around Trunks's waist.
<p>
Trunks's head hurt; so did the rest of his body. Still stunned from
the beating Enforcer and Deputy had given him, he could only blink and
hold onto Goten. He wished his head would stop spinning! And where was
Mom?
<p>
"Trunks.." A new note of dread crept into Goten's voice, "Bad things
coming."
<p>
Trunks rubbed his eyes; his head wasn't spinning so bad anymore,
though it ached like fury. He managed to rub loose the dried blood
gumming his eyelids shut and looked around.
<p>
Mom was nowhere around; the whole quarry was gone. There was nothing
but broken rock below and glowing red fog above. And there were
monsters sneaking up on them... bad things.
<p>
Trunks gulped; some of them were animal-headed men--but they didn't
look nearly so nice as the <i>hengeyoki</i> back home. Others were.. really
ugly; all slimy and tentacly or bony and twisted looking. Some were
both -- there was one who looked like a goat-man made of brown mud,
and there was a satyr-like monster with a fringe of wriggling
tentacles growing around his waist like a skirt, and a long tail with
a toothy mouth at the end.
<p>
I am not afraid, Trunks told himself. I am a prince of the Saiyajin,
and the son of Vegeta. I WILL NOT BE AFRAID! I wish Father was
here.. or Raditz-san.. or Goku-san.. or Gohan. This is just like
fighting the gaki, he tried to convince himself. (But Raditz-san isn't
here this time!) I wish I had my spirit sword--
<p>
"HEY!" Trunks jumped as the longsword appeared in his hand, as if it
had been there all the time. He stared at it--it felt <i>real</i>, it had
weight and hardness, not like before, when it was Spirit, barely
felt. He swept it back and forth experimentally, testing the balance--
<p>
The monsters charged.
<p>

<p>
Dying sucks, thought Sean as the blood thundered in his ears and his
vision began to fade--except for the demon commander and the others
with him. <i>They</i> were becoming more substantial, more real as the rest
of the world turned dark.
<p>
The wall exploded in a flash of orange.
<p>
Sean found himself sprawled on the floor, breathing once more. The
white-cloaked demon commander stood in the middle of the room, his
arms crossed in front of his face, looking.. startled.  There was also
a large new hole in the wall and in the neighboring apartment.
<p>
"I told you something didn't feel right," Sinhika's voice rang out in
the sudden silence.
<p>
"He's a Saiyajin!" an unfamiliar voice said. "I don't understand--my
blow went right through him!"
<p>
Sean squinted at the broad-shouldered young man--no older than
Sean--in the orange karate gi. His heart froze--that face and hair! He
was the very image of the scar-faced demon in the red cloak from his
painting!  Not another one!  Behind him, another, taller figure looked
around him and tried to push past.
<p>
The demon commander didn't seem too pleased to see the new
arrivals. "Great. Right when I was wrapping this mission up.." He
snapped his fingers--the demon commander's warriors reappeared around
the apartment. "Keep these fools out of my hair while I finish this
mission!"
<p>
"THEY'RE ALL SAIYAJIN!" A younger voice yelled from out in the living
room. What the hell was a 'Saiyajin'? Sean wondered.
<p>
"They're all dead," the taller interloper said flatly. "You won't be
able to hurt them--they're ghosts." He stepped forward, pushing past
the orange-garbed man. Between the two newcomers, the demon, and Sean,
the room was just about full.
<p>
"Hello, Kale--I can't say I'm glad to see you," the tall, long-haired
newcomer said.
<p>
"Raditz," Commander Kale snarled coldly, and then his eyes
widened. "You're.. breathing! YOU'RE ALIVE!" It sounded like an
accusation.
<p>
"Yeah." Raditz smirked. "I guess the demon-girl was right--there is a
gate to Hell here."
<p>
Now that he was close enough to spit on his boot, Sean finally
recognized the newcomer--it was the long-haired tough who'd been
across the street from Floodland that one time. The chill crept into
his blood again; what he'd taken for a fur belt Sean now knew to be a
tail. This guy--Raditz--was one of <i>them</i>, one of the monkey-tailed
demons of his painting. He didn't seem any more pleased to see the
demon commander--Kale--than Kale was to see him.
<p>
"Not for long," Kale snapped. "I don't know how you got yourself
incarnated again, but if you remember anything about Hell, you know
where I fit in. I have a job to do; don't get in my way, low-born!"
<p>
"Does your 'job' include killing a helpless man who can't fight you?"
the guy in orange growled. Oh, good, thought Sean; someone besides me
thinks my murder is a bad idea.
<p>
"He has the power to create forbidden gates! I have my orders; he must
die, so that this gate or another like it can never re-open." Kale
smiled cruelly. "It matters not--you do not have the power to stop me
before this weakling dies.. Kakarott."
<p>
"You know, I've beaten everyone who started by calling me that,"
'Kakarott' grinned, slipping into fighting stance. "For the record, my
name is Son Goku!"
<p>
"..and you are the Super-Saiyajin who defeated Frieza." Kale bowed, an
ironic smirk on his face. "But you can't stop what you can't touch!"
he said--and vanished. After that, everything happened at once--or at
least, too fast for Sean to follow.
<p>
Something tall and hairy flashed over Sean, and was thrown back, as if
by a blow; there was a flash of orange and another hole appeared in
his wall. An exclamation of dismay--
<p>
"I really can't hit him!" yelled Goku.
<p>
"It's just like fighting the Ghost Ochimo. Ask Gohan about that,"
Raditz laughed mockingly--
<p>
Something bright slashed the air--
<p>
--and everyone froze. Commander Kale stood awkwardly, clutching at his
shoulder; two feet of glowing white katana protruded just below his
right shoulder blade. Shock and astonishment ran across his face;
Raditz had run him through.  Raditz stepped back, pulling his blade
free with a twist; Kale staggered, but kept his feet. Phantasmal blood
welled up from the wound and vanished before it hit the floor.
<p>
Raditz's smirk deepened. "But <i>I</i> can touch you!" He lifted the sword
into guard position. "Shall I try two for two?" The smirk vanished,
and Raditz scowled. "Call off your ghosts, Kale--unless you want to
report back to Hell carrying your head under one arm!"
<p>
"Damn you, Raditz!" Kale snarled. "If I report another failure, it
doesn't matter what you do to me first!" The ghost tensed, readying
himself.
<p>
"Before you do anything stupid," Raditz snapped, "get hold of
yourself!  I'll bet your orders weren't literally 'Kill whoever made
this gate', were they, Kale? You came up with that one yourself."
Raditz growled softly.
<p>
Kale's eyes narrowed, and he nodded, almost against his will.  A
flurry of exclamations from the outer room indicated that the other
Saiyans had vanished once again.  Sean rubbed his throat and watched,
fascinated. Goku danced from side to side, trying to see around
Raditz's hair.
<p>
"So what were your orders, and who gave them?"
<p>
Kale smirked. "My orders come from King Vegeta himself! I was ordered
to find out where this rift went, and make sure whatever opened it
doesn't do so again!" He shrugged. "You see, I have no choice--and
that pitiful weakling has no choice but to die. You can't change
that!"
<p>
Raditz sneered, "Typical. You can't see beyond your orders, and you
don't think! That's what got you in trouble on Tsaba, remember?"
<p>
Kale's eyes widened with anger. "When you return to Hell," he
threatened--
<p>
"Don't worry, that'll be Real Soon Now." Raditz smirked again. "You
see, we need that rift you're in such a hurry to close--because things
are more screwed up than even you could make them if you tried! While
you've been worrying about <i>this</i> rift, someone's been throwing
<i>living</i> people physically into Hell--and it's MY job to bring them
back here where they belong!"
<p>
"WHAT???"
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"Truunnks! Behind you!" Goten yelled, and Trunks spun around.  Block,
thrust, parry, slash--another monster went down. He panted heavily;
there were so many of them, and they came from all sides.
<p>
"Goten! You have to help! I can't get them all!"
<p>
"How??? I don't know how to fight yet--Daddy was gonna teach me after
my half-way birthday!" Goten pouted angrily; Trunks saw what looked
suspiciously like a few tears running down his face.
<p>
"'You're stronger than you think'," Trunks quoted. "I don't know, hit
them with rocks or something!"
<p>
Goten brightened. "Okay!" He bent down and picked up a small boulder,
determination on his face. "But N'Uncle Raditz said that first."
<p>
Pipunc, a seriously mutated broo who resembled a goat-man carved out
of brown mud, suddenly realized he was in trouble. The tiny kid he was
about to attack had just picked up a boulder that he, Pipunc, could
barely have lifted. "Uh-oh. That kid's str--"
<p>
"GOT HIM!" Goten yelled delightedly as his boulder crashed into the
mud broo's head. The chaos demon's body dissolved into mist and seeped
away as the broken spirit fled. Goten picked up another boulder and
looked around for a new target. There were far too many.
<p>
CRACK-BOOM! A sphere of energy arced down to explode between the two
kids, incinerating another broo and flinging them through the
air. Goten found himself alone, in a narrow canyon, while Trunks.. was
not alone.
<p>
As he picked himself up, head ringing, the violet-haired boy flinched
back instinctively as something came at him from the corner of his
eye. His instincts saved him; a black, ridged tentacle just missed his
neck; teeth gnashed inches from his face.
<p>
Trunks ducked and rolled away from the goat-demon-thing; it was the
one he'd seen before, with the tentacled waist and the extra mouth on
its tail. It hissed, and raised its hand, bony knives sprouting from
its fingers as the violet-haired boy watched. Trunks raised his sword.
<p>
The demon came in slashing with both claws; Trunks backed, parrying,
and tried to counterattack, but couldn't get past the creature's
guard--it was fast! Then the tail, unlooked for, snapped around and
hooked his ankle--Trunks fell!
<p>
The monster loomed over him for an instant, claws poised--and froze. A
bloody hand emerged from the demon's chest; it was a slim, delicate
hand, and it held the demon's heart.  The hand squeezed, and the demon
dissipated, its power broken.
<p>
Trunks looked up, then scrambled to his feet. The owner of the hand
was a compact, fierce-looking woman with short dark hair, wearing dark
blue Saiyan armor with a red bodysuit and one yellow legging. The boy
glanced at her waist--she had a tail.
<p>
"You're a Saiyajin!" Trunks blurted, and then flushed. That was such a
stupidly obvious thing to say! Especially to such a
fierce-looking--and pretty--lady. Had he forgotten all his manners?
<p>
The Saiyan woman smirked, and raised her eyebrows. "Now how would a
human child know that?"
<p>
Trunks scowled fiercedly. "I'M NOT HUMAN! I'm Saiyajin, too!"
<p>
The woman put her hands on her hips. "With <i>that</i> hair?" Her voice was
skeptical.
<p>
Trunks's hands balled up into fists. "I am Trunks Vegeta Briefs, the
son of Vegeta, Prince of all Saiyajin!"
<p>
Her eyes went wide, and she started to say something--
<p>
"I find that hard to believe," interrupted a man's voice. Trunks
looked up; another Saiyajin, this one a tall, handsome warrior dressed
in light blue armor floated down beside the woman.
<p>
"Look at his face, Toma!" the woman hissed. "Ignore the hair; look at
his face."
<p>
Toma looked, and the mockery dropped away. "He has the prince's face."
He frowned at the woman, not altogether seriously, and asked, "Why am
I always the last to see these things, Celipa?"
<p>
"Yes he does--don't feel bad, I didn't see it until the boy got angry
and started yelling at me." Trunks was surprised to see Celipa <i>smile</i>
briefly at the other Saiyan--very briefly and furtively, as if smiling
was not allowed here.
<p>
"Well, that makes sense," he admitted. "Has anyone ever seen Prince
Vegeta any other way?"
<p>
"I have!" Trunks spoke up a bit sharply; these two were talking about
his father as if Trunks wasn't even there!
<p>
Celipa smirked. "He's certainly got the Prince's spirit!" The smirk
dropped away. "But what is a living child doing <i>here</i>? Something is
wrong, Toma.. very wrong."
<p>
Toma nodded. "I know. Bardock needs to know--now."
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Goten found himself alone in a deep canyon--alone, and scared. Were
there more monsters behind those rocks? Where was Trunks? Had he been
blown to pieces?  Where was Uncle Raditz? He had almost rescued them
from the bad dinosaur!
<p>
Goten thought about sitting down and waiting for Trunks to find
him--like Daddy always said to do when he was lost--but the ground was
slimy. Yecch! He couldn't sit his bottom down in <i>that</i>!  Standing
still didn't help, either--the nasty stuff just oozed over his bare
toes. Ewwwww!
<p>
Goten ran along the canyon floor, hopping from stone to stone, looking
for Trunks. Maybe he was around that corner... No. Someone else was.
Goten took one look at the familiar shape and spiky hair and ran
forward. He was dressed differently than Goten had ever seen, but
there was only one person it could be.
<p>
"Daddy!"  Goten bounded like a mountain goat from rock to rock in his
eagerness--then "Daddy" turned to look at him. Goten stopped abruptly,
skidded on the slime, and fell hard on his rear.
<p>
"You're not Daddy!" the child yelled accusingly. Daddy did not have
dark golden skin, and criss-crossed scars on his left cheek...
<p>
The stranger who looked like Goku stared at Goten in astonishment. "A
Saiyan child <i>here</i>? What vision is this--the future or the past? He
is the very image of young Kakarott--but Kakarott is a grown man,
now. How can this be?"
<p>
"I'M NOT A BISION! I'M A GOTEN!" the child yelled indignantly. "What's
a bision?"
<p>
The familiar stranger's eyes widened. "You're real--and living!
But.. who could be so cruel as to condemn a <i>child</i> to this realm?" He
took a step closer to Goten, who was struggling to his feet amid the
slippery slime.
<p>
"Of course I'm real!" Goten pouted indignantly, and then looked
thoughtful as an idea struck him. He ran boldly up to the stranger,
extended one finger, and poked him gently in the leg. Goten looked
very surprised, as if he had expected to find nothing there. "You're
fun!" he exclaimed.
<p>
The man stared at Goten with an expression of bewilderment; then the
faintest hint of a smile shadowed his lips. "It's been a long time
since someone called me that, little one!"
<p>
Goten stared up at him, puzzled. "You talk like N'Uncle Raditz!" He
pointed, "And you've got a tail like Nunk Rats, too!"
<p>
The man's eyes widened in shock. "What--How--How do you-- <i>Uncle</i>
Raditz?? You're Kakarott's child!" His brows furrowed. "But I thought
you were older.. Raditz said you were about four, and that was many
years ago, surely.." he trailed off, puzzled.
<p>
Goten pursed his lips, thinking. "Gohan is twelve." The little boy
counted on his fingers, and showed them to the man. "That's lots more
than four!" He frowned at his hands. "Only I don't have enough
fingers--that's only ten," Goten informed the stranger who seemed to
know Nunk Rats.
<p>
The stranger's eyes widened again, this time in understanding. "You're
his little brother, aren't you? Two sons.. like father, like son."
That ghost of a smile touched his lips again, and was gone, replaced
by an expression of wonder.
<p>
Goten looked at the oh-so-familiar stranger, and remembered something
he'd been told. The little boy's eyes grew round. "You're my grandpa,
aren't you? Grandpa Bardock?"
<p>
Bardock nodded, too awed to speak. How did this child know him? He
reached down and Goten held his arms up to his grandfather; Bardock
picked up the little Saiyan boy, his..  grandson! He held the boy for
a time in silence; he could not speak--his heart was too full.
<p>
"Your face is hurt," Goten broke the silence, voicing concern as his
finger traced the ancient scar on Bardock's cheek.
<p>
"It's all right," he answered. "That happened a long time ago; it
doesn't hurt anymore." Bardock held Goten away from him, looking at
him. "Where's your tail?"
<p>
Goten looked both confused and worried. "My tail? I'm supposed to have
a tail?"
<p>
"Of course--" Bardock started to answer, then frowned. "I don't know;
your mother can't be Saiyan, so perhaps not." Bardock wasn't sure
which disturbed him more about his grandson: the missing tail, or the
idea that his mother, Kakarott's mate, was.. not Saiyan. An alien; a
weak creature little better than an animal.
<p>
Don't be an idiot, Bardock! The best part of Bardock lectured himself:
look at this child--he is the very image of Kakarott, and sense his
power--it is incredible! Whoever or whatever his mother is, she made
Kakarott's blood--my blood--stronger! Even if he were not so
strong.. he is <i>my</i> grandson!
<p>
Bardock drew Goten close to him again, setting the boy on his
shoulder.  Fierce pride, and something else filled him as he looked at
the boy--I have been graced with a living son and grandsons; the
Saiyajin live on! We did not go down into oblivion, we are not
forgotten in the dust of history!
<p>
"Grandpa?" Goten ventured, continuing as Bardock looked at him
attentively. "How come you're fun? Nunk Rats--N'Uncle Raditz--" the
boy carefully corrected himself, "said you died a long time ago."
<p>
"First I will ask you a related question, because I know Raditz died
before you were born, little one. How, then, can you talk to your
uncle?" Bardock knew that Raditz had gone back to Earth as a ghost,
and was curious to hear the child's answer.
<p>
"Grandpa N'Oxking and Nunk Rats say I can see ghosts. I didn't know
that. Nunk Rats wasn't fun, but Nan Bulma accidently wished him
better, and now he's lots of fun!"
<p>
"RADITZ IS ALIVE??"
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz dozed fitfully while Sinhika made her preparations; apparently,
opening a gate between Earth and Hell required more than a few words
and a wave of the hand. It required several hours of mysterious
rituals (Why had she gone from door to window to window of the small
apartment and stroked every sill and jamb with herbs and steel?) and
chanted prayers--which bored Raditz mindless to watch. He was tired,
and hungry, and his other job, watching Kale, was even more pointless
and boring--the ghost Saiyajin had vanished, unmanifesting with a
Cheshire Cat smirk. Raditz scowled; he knew Kale well enough to
predict trouble. Kale would bide his time until the gate opened...
<p>
Gohan and Goku had a.. discussion about Gohan's part in this--Raditz
couldn't call it an argument, Gohan was too obedient to openly argue
with his father. Gohan sat dejectedly at one end of the couch; he
would be staying behind to protect Sinhika. Goku had been adamant; his
son would not follow him into Hell--something Raditz had quite agreed
with. Hell was no place for children.
<p>
Gohan didn't see it quite that way; being left behind when his father
went into danger grated on him. Dad was treating him like a child!
Why? Goku had all but forced Gohan to grow up during the Cell Game,
and afterwards... Gohan had been the man of the house for the years
Dad was gone. Why treat him like a child now?
<p>
Goku, Raditz and Bulma had had an argument; she didn't care what Goku
or Raditz said about the dangers or the horrors, Bulma was going after
her son, and nothing and no one was going to stop her. Period. As she
pointed out, she'd gone to Namek, stood with everyone when Freeza and
King Cold arrived, and generally been mixed up with everything
dangerous before and since--why, when <i>her son</i> was involved, did
anyone think she was going sit safely at home?
<p>
She'd had unexpected support from Sinhika; the orange-haired Indian
girl (as she appeared in front of Sean) took it as a personal affront
that "the men", as she put it, thought it perfectly fine to go into
danger for their children, but didn't take Bulma--a woman!--seriously
when she was willing to face Hell itself for the sake of her son!
<p>
The argument had ended when Raditz had sighed, and said, "Goku, it's
not sheer power alone that matters in Hell; virtue and love make one
stronger there, too. Bulma may well be in <i>less</i> danger than anyone
else except you, little brother."
<p>
Bulma whirled to face Raditz. "Huh? Why did you spend so much time
arguing with me, if that's the truth?"
<p>
"Because Vegeta is going to kill me when he finds out that not only
did I let his son get kidnapped by a demon and thrown into Hell, I let
his wife that I'm supposed to <i>protect</i> go to Hell after him!" Raditz
shrugged helplessly; there was something in his expression that
suggested it wasn't fear of Vegeta that drove him to protect
Bulma. "On the other hand, I will be there as well, and the Prince
can't kill me any deader for the one than the other, and.. Sinhika is
right, damn it." Raditz clenched and unclenched his fists; the
argument was over.
<p>
Raditz dozed fitfully, and dreamed. He dreamed of his first mission,
under then Subcommander Kale; he watched Kale kill the woman and
child again--and woke up shuddering. In the nightmare, the woman and
child had been Chichi and young Goten!
<p>
Raditz dozed off again, and the nightmare resumed; it was the second
nest, the one he'd cleared himself under Kale's supervision.  As he
slaughtered the inhabitants, he saw their faces--and every one of them
was someone he knew: Lina, Nezumi, Mr. Hiregumi, Bulma, Dr. Briefs,
Bulma's mother, Trunks, Ox King... He woke up, cold sweat beading on
his forehead. Not again!
<p>
For the next few hours, the long-haired Saiyan warrior dreamed of
every world-clearing mission he'd ever been on, of every innocent
creature he'd ever killed--and all of them were people he
knew--and.. <i>cared</i> about. He woke shaking as Sinhika made her final
preparations.
<p>
As the demon-girl burned incense and poured melted butter over a metal
dish full of hot coals, Raditz stared at his hands and felt
sick. Everyone he'd killed had been <i>someone's</i> mother or father, son
or daughter or lover. <i>Everyone</i>. They had all been people that
someone cared about. They had all been <i>people</i>--and he, Raditz, was a
butcher, a murderer on a scale that Earth's worst legends didn't dare
imagine. Death and Hell had been his well-deserved fate.
<p>
He'd known this in his head, of course--no one was ignorant of why
they had been condemned to Hell!--but part of him had never really
accepted it, had never really understood why squashing vermin was so
terribly wrong. His heart had been at war with itself, that tiny,
almost smothered part of it that had known from the beginning that he
was murdering <i>people</i> contending with the rest of his heart, that
felt only contempt for weaklings and pride in his own Saiyan strength.
<p>
His pride had been broken in Hell, when Raditz learned what it had
cost him, what it had cost everyone--and what a foolish illusion it
was. His contempt had been broken on Earth, where a child taught him
about loving someone unconditionally, no matter how little he appeared
to deserve it, and four humans taught him respect for more than mere
strength. There was nothing left to keep the truth out of his heart,
nothing at all.
<p>
It was time to return to Hell.

<p>
Sean looked around--the place was still a mess, but his unexpected
guests didn't seem to mind. Three good-looking girls, three guys, one
underage kid--and several evil-tempered spirits from Hell. "One hell
of an earthquake party," Sean muttered, pushing the black hair back
from his eyes.
<p>
"It's time." Sinhika stepped out of the small studio room, looking
tired.
<p>
Goku and Bulma looked attentively at Sinhika; Raditz looked up slowly
from where he'd been brooding. Once again, bleak resignation was
written on his face as he rose from the couch.
<p>
Nezumi did not like that look. "Excuse me," she said, tapping Raditz
on the elbow. "I'd like to talk to you for a moment..  privately..
<i>before</i> you leave." She nodded her head toward the tiny bedroom.
<p>
Raditz stared at her for a moment, and then followed without a word.
<p>
Nezumi faced him in Sean's small bedroom -- and found that her
boldness had left her. "Raditz.. I.." Damn it, girl! This is
important, quit stammering like a school girl!  Nezumi gathered her
courage, and stepped close to the big Saiyajin.
<p>
"..After what you tried to do in the quarry.." Nezumi frowned up at
him, and put her hands on his chest. "Don't try something like that
again. Ever! When you find the kids, you <i>will</i> come back with them,
understand?"
<p>
Raditz flushed. "What? Woman--"
<p>
Nezumi glared at him. "Don't you 'woman' me! You weren't going to come
back, were you?" she accused. "Don't you dare!" Nezumi pointed back in
the other room, "Do you really want to hurt them that much?"
<p>
It's now or never, girl! She took a deep breath, reached up and
grabbed a length of hair on each side of his face, forcing him to face
her. "Do you really want to hurt <i>me</i> that much?"
<p>
Raditz's eyes widened. In the quarry, when she stood between me and
Piccolo.. that was no fluke. I thought she was.. attracted to me, but
this! She.. It's more than.. She has no idea!
<p>
He looked down at her anxious face and tender brown eyes. How many
women on how many planets begged their lovers to return to them--just
before they died fighting the Saiyajin? (Why am I thinking of Nezumi
and 'lover' in the same thought?) <i>How many young women like Nezumi</i>
<i>have I killed??</i>
<p>
Raditz gripped Nezumi by her shoulders and snarled, "Forget it! You
don't know what I am!"
<p>
Nezumi scowled fiercely up at him. "You're wrong, Raditz! I don't know
what you did, I don't know what you used to be, but I most certainly
do know what you <i>are</i>! You are a man who would sacrifice his life and
go to <i>Hell</i> to save two small children who aren't even yours! If you
don't know what that means, you are absolutely the most clueless idiot
I have ever met!"
<p>
Raditz flushed again. "Someone else said that to me, long ago," he
muttered. "You sound just like her." He looked past Nezumi's angry
scowl and saw the tears gathering in her big brown eyes. What is this
woman doing to me?? And why does she remind me so much of Luki?
<p>
"So be it. I will do my best--and that's all I can promise; it's a
dangerous place."
<p>
Nezumi wiped her eyes on her sleeve. "Your best is all I'm asking
for. Promise?"
<p>
"I promise." He bowed his head as she rose on the tips of her toes;
their lips almost touched---
<p>
BANG! Something exploded with a crash in the outer room, and voices
were raised in anger. Raditz spun around to find out what the danger
was, and the moment was gone.
<p>

<p>
"You know, I'm damn glad you people showed up when you did..
Considering what's next, anyone care for a drink?" Sean held up a
bottle of whiskey and waved a pair of shot glasses around.
<p>
"After what I've been through tonight.. one shot wouldn't hurt." Bulma
sighed as Sean handed her a drink.
<p>
"Sure." Sean poured himself another shot and tossed it down--
<p>
"Thank you, Sean.. or should I say, VirtualBlack?" Bulma sipped the
whiskey gingerly, staring at him cooly.
<p>
Sean nearly choked on the whiskey and came up sputtering. His eyes
snapped open wide. "YOU! You're the sysadmin at Capsule Corp, aren't
you? You're the one that wiped my computer!"
<p>
"I don't know how you jumped to that wild conclusion.." Bulma tossed
her blue hair back, "..but you're right." Bulma slammed the shotglass
down and put her hands on her hips. "And <i>you</i> are the little sneak
who stole files out of our computers and tried to blackmail me!"
<p>
"Huh?" Sean stared at her in confusion. "When did I try to blackmail
you?"
<p>
Bulma leveled an accusing finger at him. "Don't deny that you cracked
through our security and then demanded a payoff to fix it! If that
isn't blackmail, what is it?"
<p>
Sean's eyebrows went up. "Marketing? Lady, I didn't create those
security holes--I just proved that they existed, to show you that you
needed someone who knew security on the payroll, and then offered my
services! Since when is trying to get a job blackmail??"
<p>
"Oh." Bulma looked sheepish, and then indignant again. "What about
stealing my files?"
<p>
"Okay, okay, I shouldn't have done that--but you pissed me off with
your answer, and one of your competitors was offering good money for
company secrets. I didn't even sell your files to them--I did it just
to prove that I could if I wanted to." Sean sulked. "You didn't have
to trash all my files."
<p>
"I didn't," she answered. "I copied them. You have some interesting
tastes in artwork."
<p>
He looked at her abruptly. "You've seen them!"
<p>
Bulma nodded. "'Wolfslayer' and 'Game of Demon Kings'. Where did you
get the ideas for those pictures?" She tried to keep the question
casual, but her voice was taut with hidden excitement.
<p>
Sean eyed her, one eyebrow raised. "Same place I got the idea for the
painting in the other room, the one that's caused all this
excitement--in dreams." He poured another shot and tossed it
down. "Dreams that won't leave me alone until I express them somehow."
The young man in black regarded Bulma thoughtfully. "Now answer a
question of mine--who is the demon prince in those pictures? Why does
he haunt me? I think you who he is."
<p>
A soft hiss of indrawn breath. "The 'demon prince', as you call him,
is my husband Vegeta."
<p>
The bottle of whiskey exploded.
<p>
"WHAT??"  Commander Kale manifested abruptly, glaring balefully at
Bulma. "You lie! The Prince would never sully his royal blood
with.. with a lower creature like you!"
<p>
Bulma clenched her fists and gritted her teeth. "'LOWER CREATURE'??
I'm a hell of a lot higher than an ill-mannered beast like you! I'll
bet you're just jealous because no decent Saiyan girl would 'sully her
blood'--or her reputation--with you!"
<p>
Kale blanched with shock; his eyes widened, then narrowed with
anger.
<p>
"Uh, Bulma," Goku said from across the room, slightly worried...
<p>
Sean stared at the shattered bottle, and the bleeding cuts where glass
shards had stuck in his hand.
<p>
"You.. son.. of.. a.. bitch." Sean said slowly, a terrible, quiet fury
in his voice. "That was my last bottle of Tennessee sipping whiskey."
He raised his eyes to glare at the evil ghost. "You come here, you try
to murder me, you destroy my stuff, you insult one of my guests in
front of my face, and YOU RUINED A PERFECTLY GOOD BOTTLE OF WHISKEY!
I've had it with you--and I don't recall inviting you here, SO GET THE
HELL OUT OF MY HOME!"
<p>
<i>Something</i> long pent up burst forth--Kale slammed into the front door
of the apartment and was held there, pinned by an invisible
force. Heads snapped up; all three Saiyajin had sensed it.  Kale's
face twisted into a grimace of pain as the Saiyajin ghost tried to
pull himself free, and failed.
<p>
"Sean, could you kindly <i>not</i> blow Kale clean through the wards I just
laid?" Sinhika stood in the doorway of the small studio, still looking
a bit tired and somewhat annoyed. "Sean? Hello? Sean! SEAN!"
<p>
Sean started, and Kale collapsed, no longer pinned to the door. "What
did I do?" the artist said, slightly confused. The ghost Saiyajin got
to his feet, shook himself, and vanished with a scowl.
<p>
"You tried to throw him out--he's an evil spirit, you didn't invite
him, you're the 'owner' of this dwelling..." she shrugged. "All it
took was will, and boom! He would have been out the door--except for
my wards.  I laid those to keep anything that emerged from that
painting from getting loose in the rest of the world--he counts."
<p>
Sean gaped at the demon-girl. "You mean I could have thrown him out
the whole time?" She nodded. "He nearly killed me!"
<p>
"You didn't know," Sinhika said. "I bet you never actually commanded
him to leave, did you?"
<p>
Sean blinked. "Uh, no. It never occurred to me."
<p>
"There you go." Sinhika tossed her orange hair back, and stood with
her hands on her hips.
<p>
"I'm not sure I understand," commented Goku, looking slightly
puzzled.
<p>
"It makes perfect sense to me," growled Raditz, a bit testy at the
interruption. "Forget that Kale's a Saiyajin--he's an 'evil' spirit
from Hell; the usual powers affect him."
<p>
"You mean like those charms against evil spirits that Mom and Ox-King
hang over all the doors and windows at home? Those would work on him?"
Gohan asked.
<p>
"Yep." Raditz smirked. "The <i>only</i> reason I could enter your house
when I was a ghost was because <i>Ox-King gave me his permission</i>--and
that would not have been enough if I had been an enemy."
<p>
Goku smiled. "I understand now." He looked at Sinhika, who was
standing expectantly in the doorway. "Are we--?"
<p>
"Yes," she answered. "Everything's ready for the final invocation;
prepare yourselves."
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Kale watched the final preparations as he paced back and forth,
invisible and immaterial, a ghost. The demon-girl had trapped him; he
could neither escape nor return. The others, yes--he sent them back,
to warn the King that he would soon have unexpected visitors at
court. He could not return, not until the King's curse was fulfilled:
"Make sure whatever opened the gate doesn't ever do it again!"
<p>
Thanks to the demon-girl's magic, he couldn't leave this place,
either--not that Kale had ever intended to abandon his king and his
duty. There was little chance he could carry out his duty, now that
that wretched human artist knew how to cast Kale out of his
dwelling--a humiliation the weakling would pay dearly for if ever he
came to Hell.
<p>
Still.. Kale's eyes narrowed as he thought. There were two
possibilities, and one was stupid--marooning several living, non-evil
souls in Hell was <i>not</i> something the King would appreciate--dead
souls who didn't belong in Hell had been quite enough of a
problem. But the other option..
<p>
Raditz was correct; his orders didn't say to kill the artist of the
rift. Let someone higher than Kale stand in judgment of the young
man's life; Kale would just make sure he painted no more pictures in
the meantime.

<p>
Brakes squealed as the car stopped abruptly, just short of crashing
into the police barricade. The dead man got out of the car as the
police officer hurried toward him. The black leather coat flapped open
in the breeze.
<p>
"You can't go into the city--only emergency vehicles are allowed-- Oh
my God!" The cop froze, a look of horror on his face as he got a good
look at the dead man. Terrible wounds gaped beneath the loosely
flapping coat; loops of intestine hung out of the dead man's slashed
and gutted belly. The officer knew the man had to be dead; no one
could live like that--nor should he walk.
<p>
The dead man grinned unpleasantly; in a flash too fast for the
policeman to see, it had him by the throat. Two other policeman came
running up, guns drawn.
<p>
The dead man turned his head.  "Children of Darkness, take them!" He
rasped in a whisper. The shadows of the night took shape, and
swallowed the other men.
<p>
The policeman's struggles grew weaker and weaker until he hung limp in
the dead man's grasp. Still the dead man did not let go, but held him
as he withered and shrank.  At last the dead man threw down what had
once been a strong young man, but now was nothing more than withered,
dried skin over brittle, dry bones.
<p>
"Better," he whispered to himself. The dead man looked himself over;
the gaping wounds were partially healed, and his entrails no longer
spilled down. <i>That</i> had been quite an annoyance while driving. "Half
a lung.. I need more than that. Yessss.. one of these cattle is still
alive. Children, enough! Go and play until I need you anon!" The dead
man's eyes glowed crimson.
<p>
The shadows withdrew, revealing one frozen corpse, and one shivering,
whimpering man, wide-eyed with terror. The dead man knelt beside him,
smiling hideously.
<p>
"You'll do," he rasped.
<p>

<p>
Up and up Vegeta flew, Mogris trailing in his wake. He spiralled up
the infinite waterfall, where Styx plunged through the barrier of
Time. He could not say whether the journey took hours or centuries,
for there was no Time in this place. At last, soaked with spray, he
passed back into History, back into the Seventh Hour of Night.
<p>
"Finally!" Prince Vegeta looked around, pondering the lore Prince
Khara had briefed him on so long ago.  Upstream, the Stygian Nile
quickened as it rushed toward the great waterfall; downstream, the
riverbed was dry, all of its flow diverted into the waterfall. Along
the banks, strange gods gathered beams and girders and caissons; plans
to repair the hole in the floor of Night were evidently in progress.
<p>
The shortest path back to Earth should be to follow Ra's path from the
Cave of the Dawn... Vegeta flew downstream, following the dry
riverbed. In the Ninth Hour, he slowed down, daunted by the fiery glow
and intense heat ahead. He squinted, peering ahead under shaded
hand. A great golden riverboat rested on the dry river bottom,
stranded by the loss of the Nile. Within stood a brightness too
intense for Vegeta to look at directly.
<p>
"<i>Kuso</i>! The Sun is stranded--I can't follow him out of the Night--and
I can't pass him!" Vegeta turned back toward the Seventh Hour just as
Mogris caught up to him.
<p>
"What did I miss?"
<p>
"Eternal Night. The Sun can't rise as long as the river pours through
that damned hole!" Vegeta snarled as he flew back to the Seventh
Hour.
<p>
He alighted facing a pair of gods who were consulting a sheaf of
blueprints. One, a powerfully-built bull-headed man with long straight
horns turned his head toward Vegeta. The other, an ibis-headed scribe
who was making marks here and there on the blueprints, only turned his
eyes for a moment.
<p>
Prince Vegeta raked through his mind for Khara's lecture on the gods
of Egypt. The bull-god was Khnum, the Builder; the ibis should be
Thoth, Scribe and Sorceror. Vegeta stared at the ibis-god.
<p>
"Which one of you two can tell me when this hole will be fixed?"
<p>
Thoth finally lifted his head to look directly at Vegeta. "Possibly
never, if the serpent continues to interfere. He will not be slain
until Bast comes, and she will not come until Ra reaches the
Dawn--which will not happen until the Nile flows in its rightful bed."
<p>
"What serpent?" asked Mogris.
<p>
"That serpent," pointed Khnum.
<p>
Prince Vegeta turned; Apep the Night Serpent reared its head from the
hole in the riverbed, black scales glistening.
<p>
"Oh, <i>that</i> Serpent!" Vegeta sneered disdainfully.
<p>

<p>
Where in all this devastation is Sinhika? Prince Khara worried as he
flew invisibly over darkened streets and rubble. Was she all right?
From what he'd seen, humans were still as ignorant as ever about their
kind, and he had no fears for her from <i>them</i>, but.. If she had been
caught in a falling building and crushed.. Khara could never forgive
himself if she'd come to harm--he was supposed to <i>protect</i> his
younger sister, not abandon her to her own devices in a disaster area!
<p>
Think; you are a prince of Lankha and a scholar. You had her address;
there is no sign of her anywhere near the ruins of her
apartment--therefore, she is somewhere else. But where, and why? Three
things could send her elsewhere--duty, friendship, physical
necessity. Her dwelling was in ruins--necessity demands she must
shelter elsewhere--among friends. Prince Khara did not feel the pull
of duty, so that could be dismissed.  All he need do was find which
friends still had suitable shelter, and he should find
Sinhika... Where then, were her friends?
<p>
Khara sighed.  It seemed he must do some labor with his own hands,
searching for clues in the remains of her apartment. Perhaps the
neighbors might know something, if any remained?
<p>
A sound caught his attention as he pondered, the sound of a crying
child. What? Prince Khara rose into the air, and drifted in the
direction of the sound.
<p>
No; not a crying child, a screaming child--a little girl who ran
screaming in mad terror down the street, running from.. darkness. A
wave of deeper darkness that not even Khara's emerald eyes could
pierce flowed over the rubble after the child. As she ran over the
broken rubble the inevitable happened: she fell, and the darkness
closed in.
<p>
"<i>Ashubhaam aadhyaatmikuum andhakaara</i>! A darkness elemental, here?"
Prince dropped to the ground, drawing the bejeweled hand-and-half
sword his father gave him long ago. It flashed with his power as he
appeared, standing between the fallen girl and the onrushing darkness.
<p>
Once, twice, thrice the great blade flashed, and the darkness parted
with an inhuman shriek. Only the calm night remained. Khara turned to
check on the girl.
<p>
She stared wide-eyed at the tall, emerald-eyed Indian prince in his
turban and long brocaded coat.  "Who are you?" she asked in awed
tones.
<p>
He bowed politely. "I am Prince Khara of Lankha. And who are you, and
where are your parents?"
<p>
"I'm Miko, and.. and.. that monster attacked my mommy!" Her blue eyes
began to fill with tears.
<p>
Khara frowned slightly. "Where is your mother, child?  She may need
help, quickly!"
<p>
Miko nodded, and ran back the way she came, Prince Khara striding
quickly after.

<p>
In Hell, another child talked to his rescuer. Bardock listened,
continually bemused, interjecting a question now and then, as Goten
chattered on and on. As he flew along the canyon looking for the rest
of his team, the warrior got an earful about Daddy (Kakarott, of
course), Nunk Rats (Raditz, apparently), Mommy, Trunks, Nan Bulma
(Trunks' mother), Gohan (his older brother), Grandpa N'Ox King, the
"Bad Dinosaur" (some kind of demon) that had kidnapped him, and some
large, powerful demon that Raditz had defeated or nearly been killed
by, possibly both--Goten was a bit confusing on that topic.
<p>
Goten was a bit confusing on <i>every</i> topic, but it was enough to know
that both his sons were alive--and that Bardock need no longer be
ashamed of his firstborn son. Whatever Raditz was doing, he seemed to
have reconciled with his younger brother, and this little one admired
him and looked up to him--his son could have no better witness.
<p>
"..and Daddy trained Nunk Rats and Trunks and--" Goten broke off,
looking worried. "We've got to find Trunks! He got lost when it went
BOOM!"
<p>
"Your friend Trunks is <i>here</i>??" Bardock started out of his reverie;
he'd only been half-listening.
<p>
Goten pouted; Grandpa Bardock was as bad as Daddy about not paying
attention! "Trunks fighted the bad monsters, and something went BOOM!
An' I went bounce! Where'd Trunks go?"
<p>
"We will find him," Bardock promised, arcing above the canyon toward
the recently blasted crater that had obliterated half the Pit of Worms
region. Yes! There were Celipa and Toma, as he had sensed. Panboukin
and Totepo were much further away, and busy, Bardock sensed. But who
was Celipa carrying, and why had she removed her armor? He descended
to meet them.
<p>
"TRUNKS!" Goten yelled jubiliantly past Bardock's ear. The boy waved
frantically at the figure in Celipa's arms, who seemed to be wearing
Celipa's body armor.
<p>
"Bardock! You found one, too!" Toma exclaimed, wide-eyed at the sight
of the child in Bardock's arms. Bardock stared at the purple-haired
boy holding onto Celipa's neck. The purple-haired boy stared boldly
back at him, albeit with some confusion.
<p>
"Why is he wearing your armor, Celipa?" Bardock wondered; what was it
about the boy? There was something vaguely familiar about his face...
<p>
"It wouldn't do for the King's grandson to be running around in
nothing but his underwear." Celipa smirked at Bardock's astonishment.
<p>
"The King's gra-- He's Prince Vegeta's son?"
<p>
No wonder that face looked familiar! But that.. <i>hair</i>! He must have
gotten it from his mother, who must be.. not Saiyan. Human. But.. the
Prince? With a weakling non-Saiyan female? The Prince???
<p>
There were no Saiyan women left, you idiot! Bardock rebuked
himself. Still.. it disturbed him. He'd excused Kakarott in his own
mind long ago--his son could hardly be blamed if he'd lost all memory
of his own race and didn't even know he wasn't one of the locals!
But.. the Prince? He knew exactly what he was doing when he took some
woman of Earth for his mate!
<p>
Bardock glanced at Goten, who was telling Trunks--<i>Prince</i>
Trunks!--about his new grandfather. Goten <i>had</i> talked about Trunks,
and said his mother was "Nan Bulma"--but had not mentioned Trunks'
father.
<p>
"He's your grandfather?" Trunks' eyes were wide as he looked at
Bardock, with something that looked disturbingly like respect. "You
are Goku-san's father?"
<p>
Yes, his tone was definitely respectful! That wasn't right--a Vegeta
prince did not defer to a low-class warrior!  Even if Bardock was no
longer really a low-class warrior.
<p>
"Yes, young prince." To his surprise, Trunks made a wry face, and
sighed.
<p>
"That's what Raditz-san did when he first showed up--he called me
'young prince' all the time." Trunks looked slightly smug as he
continued, "but Mom made him stop that. She says it gives me a bad
attitude. I think she meant that I started talking back and getting in
trouble too much, 'cause she only tells me I've got a bad attitude
right after I get in trouble." The purple-haired boy looked sheepish.
<p>
Bardock smiled ever so slightly. Whatever the boy's lineage, he
reminded Bardock more of his own son Raditz than the long grown Prince
Vegeta--not that he'd ever had any real contact with the prince during
his life. A strong mother, a fierce, proud father, and a boy with a
nose for trouble--as all boys have.
<p>
He noticed Celipa quickly cover her mouth with her free
hand--suppressing a giggle. But there was also a certain sorrow in her
eyes, and Toma hovered protectively near. Bardock sighed quietly to
himself--he knew his teammates, his <i>friends</i> well enough, alive or
dead. To hold and protect the Saiyan child was a bittersweet joy for
her, that renewed her unending grief for the children she and Toma
never lived to have.
<p>
"Bardock." Toma was serious, as serious as Bardock had ever seen
him. "What are we going to do with them? Living children,
innocents, <i>here</i>.. something is terribly wrong. This is.." The tall
handsome Saiyajin was at a loss for words.
<p>
"This is an abomination," Bardock stated flatly. A certain implacable
determination entered his eyes and voice. "They <i>must</i> be sent back,
to the living world--and we will make sure of it. Whoever, or whatever
did this will pay for this perversion of reality and justice--fate is
not kind to those who mock it, and justice even less." He smiled
wickedly, in anticipation. "And if we Saiyajin reach them first.."
<p>
Toma and Celipa smiled evilly as well. "Don't be greedy and keep them
to yourself, Bardock," Celipa half-mocked. "Share the 'fun'." Her
voice was mocking, but a cold fury burned behind her eyes, fury at
whoever would consign a child to Hell.
<p>
"Haven't I always?" Bardock asked.
<p>
"Always," answered Toma. "Anything any one of has asked for, you have
given." He smiled ever so slightly at his leader.
<p>
"Save once," Bardock said, his mood changing abruptly, regret in his
voice and eyes. "The most important thing you asked for.. I could not
give you."
<p>
"Let it go, Bardock! I asked you for the impossible! Will you continue
to condemn yourself because you did not have the power of a god? I do
not--I <i>cannot</i> hold it against you; why do you still hold it against
yourself that you could not save Vegetasai?"
<p>
"Because I failed to keep my promise to a dying friend."
<p>
"And you know I forgave you <i>that</i> a long time ago!" Toma
sighed. "Then keep a new promise to your dead friend..."
<p>
Bardock looked sharply at him. "What?"
<p>
"Promise me you will forgive yourself, old friend. Let it go." Toma
spoke softly.
<p>
Bardock closed his eyes briefly. "I will--when we no longer pay the
price of my failure. When we are free of Hell."
<p>
"Hell?" Goten squeaked, and suddenly threw his arms around his
grandfather's neck and hugged tight, screaming and crying
hysterically. "HELL??  AAAAAHHHHHH! I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE BAD! GRANDPA,
TELL MOMMY I'M SORRY!!!  I DIDN'T MEAN TO--"
<p>
"GOTEN!" Bardock's voice cracked authoritatively even as he held the
terrified little boy close, ruffling his hair and comforting
him. "Stop yelling and listen to me!"
<p>
"Grandpa?" The combination of comfort and firm authority stopped
Goten's hysteria cold. He looked up at his grandfather's face, scared,
yet trusting the Saiyan warrior completely.
<p>
"Good, you're listening. Little one, it is not your fault you are
here--the one who sent you here did a very evil thing; so very evil
that even the demons of Hell would not do it. <i>You do not belong</i>
<i>here!</i> Do you understand that?"
<p>
Goten nodded mutely, tears beginning to dry.
<p>
"Second, you are a Saiyajin, and Saiyajin do not scream and carry on
like wailing banshees! If a Saiyajin is afraid--and don't let anyone
convince you that Saiyajin never feel fear!--he keeps it to himself,
so that his fear does not shame him and dishearten his comrades."
<p>
"Banshee?" whispered Toma to Celipa.
<p>
"Female psychopomp demon from Earth's borderlands--has the most
ungodly loud screech imaginable," Celipa whispered back.
<p>
"Third, we will do our very best to get you and Trunks home. I promise
you that, Goten son of my son Kakarott, on my honor as Saiyan warrior
and by my blood which runs in your veins." He looked at Toma, Celipa
and Trunks, who was pale and trembling in Celipa's arms.
<p>
"We're going back to the palace," Bardock said. "If the gods do watch
over innocent children, and if Kale's bad luck has run true to form,
then that rift is still open. That may be the children's one chance to
get home alive. Toma, Celipa--let's go."
<p>

Where a painting had rested on an easel, there was now a hole in the
air. Sean thought it looked like a picture window had been installed
in mid-air: a rectangular, frameless window three times the size of
his original painting that looked down into the infernal throne room.
The view was crystal clear--it had none of the flatness or blurriness
of a painting. Hot air with a stench of sulfur and things long dead
blew out of the opening.
<p>
Sean stepped back, giving the others plenty of room. Raditz studied
the opening for several minutes, and turned to Goku.
<p>
"They're expecting us; see how tense the guards are, and how they keep
glancing at the gate while never staring directly at it?  Kale must
have warned them."
<p>
"They might be just worried about it in general, and not expecting us
specifically," Goku countered.
<p>
"Either way, we may have to fight our way through them." Raditz
grinned at his brother. "Ready, little brother?"
<p>
"Ready!" Goku dove gracefully through the opening, followed by Raditz.
<p>
"HEY! DON'T YOU DARE LEAVE ME BEHIND!" Bulma yelled, and jumped
through the opening.

<p>
"GOKUUUUU!" Bulma screamed as she realized two things: one, the rift
opened a good fifty feet above the throne room floor, and two, no one
was holding her!
<p>
Goku turned, and, faster than Bulma could see, caught her. "Oops! I
guess I forgot about carrying you." He smiled sheepishly.
<p>
Bulma glared at him and at Raditz's back. "Hmmph! I'll bet you two
were just trying to sneak out and leave me behind!"
<p>
Raditz concentrated on the three Saiyajin who'd flown up to meet them,
poised for combat. He smirked knowingly--he recognized the leader.
<p>
"PREPARE TO DIE, MORTALS! It is forbidden for the living to-- RADITZ??
What in Hell's name are you doing here? ALIVE??" The foremost warrior,
a broad-shouldered Saiyajin with a remarkable resemblance to Goku
broke off in mid-speech, shocked. His eyes grew even wider when he
looked at black-haired Goku. "The Super Saiyajin!"
<p>
Raditz's smirk widened into a wicked grin. "So Kale didn't warn you
just <i>who</i> was coming through, did he? Did he at least tell you <i>why</i>
we're here, Turles?"
<p>
Turles regained his composure. "What? Kale hasn't told anyone
anything--he can't. The King forbade him to return until Kale closed
that rift for good! His squad second told us someone would be coming
through."  He looked Goku up and down. "So you're my young cousin
Kakarott, the Super Saiyajin!"
<p>
"My name," Goku gritted his teeth, "is Son Goku!"
<p>
"Give it up, little brother; you'll never convince every single
Saiyajin to call you by your Earth name--not unless Prince Vegeta gets
hit on <i>his</i> head, and starts calling you 'Goku'," Raditz commented
dryly.
<p>
"Wait a minute!" Bulma interrupted. "You're saying that Kale is still
back in Sean's apartment? Sean's in danger!"
<p>
"It's too late to worry about that," Raditz said. "Gohan and the
demon-girl will have to handle him themselves. They know his secret."
<p>
Turles glared at the blue-haired woman held by Goku, and then at Goku
and Raditz in turn. "Why are you here, then? You know better than to
come here in the body! And who is this woman?"
<p>
"We're here," said Son Goku, "to find my son and her son! If you have
them, give them back!"
<p>
"WHAT??" Turles' eyes widened with shock; the two other warriors also
looked shocked.
<p>
"You heard him," Raditz growled. "My nephew, and her son," the
long-maned Saiyajin jerked a thumb toward Bulma, "were thrown bodily
into Hell by one evil bastard of a demon. The demon is dead; we don't
think the kids are, and we're here to get them back. If you think
we're violating a few rules, what are the rules on INNOCENT MORTAL
CHILDREN being sent to HELL??"
<p>
Turles hovered motionless, shocked into silence for a long
moment. "Trava!" He snapped at the warrior to his left. "Inform the
King!"
<p>
"At once, Commander!" So saying, the lower-ranking warrior darted away
and down.
<p>
"Come," ordered Turles. "We will wait on the King." He dropped down
before the empty throne, and looked back, plainly expecting them to
follow.
<p>
"Raditz, we don't have time for this!" Goku said quietly in his
brother's ear. "I mean, it's really interesting to meet my relatives
and all, but--"
<p>
Raditz cut him off with a slashing move of his hand and answered back
just as quietly, "King Vegeta is also the Duke Infernal of this
Hell.. <i>If</i> he's willing to help us, it will save us a lot of time and
trouble. Little brother--I know what I'm talking about; trust me."
With that, he dropped down beside Turles; after a moment, Goku
followed, still carrying Bulma, whom he set down.
<p>
Bulma stood on her own two feet and smoothed out the borrowed blouse
she was wearing.  Black wasn't her favorite color, but she supposed
she ought to be happy that Sean had something around his apartment in
her size, or she'd still be in her nightshirt. Bulma couldn't help but
wonder about his ex-girlfriend, though--the black jeans were fine, but
some of the <i>other</i> clothes she'd declined.. Yiiiiee!
<p>
Goku and Bulma looked around while they waited, taking in
everything. "So this is just like the King's palace on Vegetasai?"
Bulma asked.
<p>
"Yes," Raditz said. He wished the two of them would stop gawking and
rubbernecking like tourists; it was embarassing. On the other hand,
Turles and most of the guards were giving Goku surreptious curious
looks--they were trying to look professional and not stare, while at
the same time staring in curiousity at the legendary Super Saiyajin.
<p>
He turned to Turles and in a low voice said, "You're quiet--you have
not said a word yet about how things would have been different if you
had gone on that scouting mission instead of me. That used to be your
favorite topic."
<p>
Turles' dark eyes flicked toward Raditz, and the barest hint of a
smirk crossed his face. "You haven't forgotten anything, have you? I'm
surprised; it is said the living do not remember death."
<p>
Behind the smirk, Raditz saw something else in Turles' dark eyes,
desperate need and dead hope--and he knew all too well what Turles
longed hopelessly for. Raditz had spent eight years of eternity with
the same desperate need and hopelessness.
<p>
"A lot of things are said that aren't true. What changed, cousin?"
<p>
"I learned the answer to my question," the dead warrior said. "Lord
Enma granted me the boon of seeing what would have happened if I had
not done Bardock the favor of sending you on that scouting mission,
but had gone myself."
<p>
"And?" Raditz raised an eyebrow, genuinely curious.
<p>
"It was not.. good. Even though I would have survived the destruction
of Vegetasai.." Turles sighed. "You would have survived anyway, since
you would have been sent with Nappa to guard Vegeta, and I would have
found that damn Doom Tree of yours... and died trying to use it."
<p>
"<i>Use it??</i> I don't even want to know how you could <i>use</i> a
world-destroying monstrosity like that!" Raditz exclaimed.
<p>
Turles smirked. "You yourself found out the properties of the
fruit--imagine the thing taking root in a truly fertile world instead
of some desert moon. A world like.. Earth."
<p>
After a long silence, Raditz finally answered, "Some things are not
good to imagine."
<p>
"Heh. Yes. Kakarott would have killed me, and destroyed the Tree;
after that it would have been.. worse. I do not understand the
connection, but because the Namek Piccolo lived, Vegeta died, and
Kakarott would not have been strong enough to fight Frieza. The last
of the Saiyajin would have died when Frieza destroyed Earth; Frieza
would have won."  Turles fell silent for a moment. "I no longer regret
doing that favor for Bardock."
<p>
But there is so much else you do regret, Raditz knew. So much.. as do
I. But I.. I see both sides of it now, and I regret it twice over;
once for myself, and once for those I wronged. I think you are still
spared that, cousin.
<p>
The sound of echoing footsteps caught Raditz's attention; the
black-bearded chamberlain Kosho strode into the vast hall, followed
closely by two taller Saiyajin.
<p>
"All kneel before the King!" proclamed the chamberlain as King Vegeta
took his throne, and Sullion, his shield man, stood at his left hand.
<p>
All knelt before the King; all, except Goku. He remained standing,
staring curiously at the Saiyan king.  Tall, broad-shouldered,
bearded--but for all that, his face and hair were distinctly Vegeta's.
<p>
"Wow! You really are Vegeta's father!"
<p>
Kosho, who was watching from his place in the shadows to the left of
the throne, cringed visibly. Turles glanced quickly around, confirming
that he was not in the line of fire between Kakarott and the King;
Raditz's tail twitched nervously. Even Bulma rolled her eyes in
resigned disgust at Goku's homespun manners.

King Vegeta furrowed his brow in anger, at first; as he studied
Kakarott's open, innocent face he calmed slightly. The
idiot--extremely powerful idiot, the King reminded himself--intended
no insult. An odd look, almost of recognition was crossing Kakarott's
face as the King answered.
<p>
"You are Kakarott, the Super-Saiyajin who defeated Frieza!" The King
waved his hand, indicating to the others that they could rise. "Why
did you come here?  Did you not know that your life is forfeit?" Anger
and something else turned his voice into a harsh snarl.
<p>
Goku's eyes narrowed and his face was at once serious; his resemblance
to Turles was suddenly obvious and pronounced. "Didn't Turles's
messenger tell you? I'm here to get my son and Bulma's son back!"
<p>
"A <i>child</i> in Hell? A <i>living</i> child??" King Vegeta rose from his
throne, angrier still. "HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?" He glared at the four in
front of him.
<p>
"Two children: my son Goten, and Bulma's son." Goku clenched his
fists, and explained briefly about the demon kidnapping the children,
the ritual they interrupted, and the demon's terrible revenge.
<p>
King Vegeta scowled, and clenched his own fists angrily. "You have
come for your son, that I understand" --the tone of his voice was
passionately angry, touched with remembered pain-- "and the woman
looks for her son, but why are you here, Raditz? Why forfeit the gift
of life you have received?"
<p>
Raditz bowed. "It was--and is--my duty to protect Bulma and her son,
my king."
<p>
The king's eyes narrowed again. "But you were sent back <i>at my son's</i>
<i>request</i> to protect.." King Vegeta's eyes widened suddenly, and he
turned abruptly to Bulma.
<p>
"YOU!" He snarled, "You are Prince Vegeta's mate, and your child is..
is <i>my grandson</i>!" The Saiyan King glared balefully at her. "But
you.. you are not Saiyajin, you are weak.. pathetic.."
<p>
"EXCUUSE ME!" Bulma hands were on her hips; she glared angrily at the
Saiyan king. "Prince Vegeta doesn't find me all that weak, and I
wouldn't start calling other people pathetic if I were you--being the
ghost king of a dead world whose subjects are ALL ghosts IMPRISONED IN
HELL isn't exactly something to boast about!"
<p>
With a snarl of rage, King Vegeta summoned and flung a ball of ki
straight at Bulma...
<p>
Paaft.. BOOM! Almost lazily, Goku stretched his hand out and flicked
the king's attack up and away, to explode somewhere near the high,
cavernous ceiling. Gravel and dust showered down.
<p>
Bulma paled and shrank back behind Goku; Raditz stepped up behind her
and watched Turles and the other Guardsman suspiciously.
<p>
"Our children--that's <i>all</i> that matters here," Goku reminded King
Vegeta and Bulma.
<p>
"Then go and find them! I will not stop you," King Vegeta growled. "It
is a fool's quest--even if you find them, you still will not leave
Hell alive!"
<p>
"We'll see," Goku smiled that certain way he always did before a good
fight. White power rose around him, enveloped him; he picked up Bulma
and hurtled after Raditz.
<p>
Once clear of the palace, Goku glanced over at his brother. "You feel
them, don't you?"
<p>
"I can sense Goten, definitely," Raditz answered. "But this
place..  direction, distance is all wrong from what you know, little
brother. Be careful of trusting your senses here." He glanced at
Goku. "Can't you sense them?"
<p>
"I think so," the younger Saiyajin answered, his face drawn as if in
pain. "But there is so much evil ki here.. they stand out, only a few
ki even as good as you were, but it hurts to look for them."
<p>
"Yeah. Welcome to Hell, little brother."
<p>

<p>
The dead man abandoned the stolen car again--it was the fourth or
fifth he'd hotwired and taken, driven until rubble blocked his path,
then abandoned. He was close to his goal--somewhere in the heart of
the city, his enemies had vanished from his senses. He stood and
looked around, senses tingling.  Somewhere nearby there was a great
power, well-hidden, and a strange disturbance.
<p>
Finally he looked up--and spotted it. Or rather, spotted <i>him</i>. The
alien Piccolo hovered above one of the few unruined buildings
downtown. The dead man narrowed crimson eyes; how convenient of his
enemies to leave this sentinel, announcing their presence!
<p>
Piccolo was too powerful for him to face; he must be careful to avoid
the alien's notice. He crooked his finger, and summoned the Children
of Darkness again. They came eagerly to his command, ready for new
victims.  The dead man frowned; one was missing. He shrugged; no
matter, it was one of the weaker ones.
<p>
Chaos and darkness set foot on the stairs to Hell.

<p>
Sean glanced at Nezumi, Gohan, and Sinhika in turn. They were all
engrossed in the scene unfolding before them, as Raditz and Goku faced
the other Saiyajin. Sound carried faintly through the rift, so they
could even hear the louder parts of the conversation. A hot wind
continued to blow out of the rift. The artist shivered.
<p>
"Sin, is it my imagination, or is that rift really wide-open between
here and there?"
<p>
"All things physical and spiritual go through; I had to make the gate
two-way, or they wouldn't be able to return," the demon-girl
answered. Only one may open such a gate, my innocent lover--and not a
mere mortal demon such as myself. Be happy you do not understand the
sacred tongue and do not know whom I invoked--nor that He answered!
Destiny moves this night: the Creator rests, the Preserver acts, the
Destroyer waits.
<p>
"Wonderful. My apartment is now the antechamber to Hell." He reached
for the whiskey bottle before remembering that Kale had destroyed
it. "I wonder if that violates my lease?"
<p>
Sinhika looked thoughtful for a moment. "It probably violates any
clauses on tenant remodeling without permission of the owner, and
might touch on the single-occupancy clause."
<p>
"Only if something moves in--oh, right, something already has." Sean
rolled his eyes from side to side theatrically. "Um, this may be a
stupid question, but what keeps anyone else from over there from
moving in and subletting the place?"
<p>
"That's Gohan's job, and yours, and, to a lesser extent, mine," the
dusky orange-haired girl answered.
<p>
Sean stared suspiciously at Gohan; the long-haired kid stared back at
him quizzically. "No offense, kid, but aren't you a bit young for the
job?  Back when I went to middle school, 'Demon Hunting 101' just
wasn't on the curriculum."
<p>
Gohan folded his arms and looked smug. "I'm strong for my age."
<p>
"Yeah, right. I'll take your word for it. Okay, so how is it <i>my</i> job,
too? I'm not a martial artist, or a demon, or whatever--I'm just a
guy." The young man in black folded his arms and scowled, black hair
drooping into his face again.
<p>
"It's still your dwelling--remember how you nearly threw Kale out? If
any spirits come through that gate, just tell them they're not invited
and send them back." Sinhika answered in a matter-of-fact tone.
<p>
"Okaaaay. I'll be sure and do that--not that it worked on Kale or
anything."
<p>
Sinhika shook her head. "He's a special case--there's something
stopping him from going back through the gate."
<p>
"Yeah, plain orneriness." Sean grumbled. "Speaking of ornery weird
people," He glanced at Nezumi, "There's something profoundly
disturbing about a guy who says things like 'back when I was
ghost...'" He picked up an empty shot glass and inspected it closely
for any remaining traces. "That's getting just a little bit <i>too</i>
'goth' for my tastes."
<p>
Nezumi turned away from the window overlooking Hell to face Sean. She
tilted her head a bit to the side, thoughtful, a glint in her
eyes. "Raditz also does things like demand to be sent <i>back</i> to
Hell. Go figure that one out." She smiled mischieviously.
<p>
"Definitely way too 'goth'..." Sean smirked.
<p>
BAM! BAM! BAM!
<p>
Sean jumped about a foot into the air. "What the hell? Who the hell is
banging on my door in the middle of the friggin' night during a
disaster curfew??"
<p>
BAM! BAM! BAM!
<p>
"That's odd," muttered Gohan. "I can't sense anyone out there."
<p>
"WHO IS IT?" yelled Sean.
<p>
CR-CRACK! The door split down the middle and fell in splintered pieces
to the floor. A man stood there, his face hidden in shadows. His
clothes were tattered and bloody and his long dark hair was matted
with blood and worse. He lifted his head revealing eyes that blazed
with an unholy crimson light, and smiled a cold, thin-lipped
smile. With his long black leather coat swirling about his legs, the
evil sorceror Voron strode into the apartment.
<p>
"Voron." Sean said flatly. "I didn't invite <i>you</i>."
<p>
"Voron.. is dead," the dead man rasped. "And I don't need an
invitation. But <i>they</i> do."  He lifted his hand and crooked his
finger, beckoning to the darkness outside. Darkness poured in the door
and swallowed them all.
<p>

<p>
For Gohan, the worst part was the memories of all his old fears. In
the cold, silent dark, everything he'd been afraid of came back to
him--the shock and terror as the long-haired stranger named Raditz
beat his father and took him far away; the terrible loneliness and
loss when Piccolo told him his father was dead and abandoned him in
the wilderness; his fear when he faced Nappa--the first person who
truly wanted to <i>kill</i> Gohan; the moment of terror when Frieza
reappeared after Dad's Genki Dama, seemingly indefeatable and killed
Kulilin, and promised to kill Gohan next; and the absolute horror that
was Cell.  In the darkness, it all came back to him now; added to it
was the growing, devouring fear that he would never, ever see his
father again--from Hell, there would be no return.
<p>
In his fear, he called out to the one person who had been there for
him over the years: "PICCOLO!"
<p>
&lt;Gohan!&gt;
<p>
&lt;Piccolo? Where are you? It's so dark and cold... I'm scared.&gt; He
stopped breathing and became very quiet, hiding in the dark from the
fear.
<p>
&lt;GOHAN!&gt; Gohan could feel the fear in Piccolo's mind. &lt;DON'T LET GO!
I'm coming!&gt;
<p>
What does he mean, "Don't let go"? Gohan wondered as the cold darkness
crept into his heart and mind, stilling them.
<p>

<p>
Sean shivered in the bitter cold, the blind dark silence angering him
as he fell over the end table by the couch. He cursed, but could not
hear himself in the enveloping darkness. Oh joy, total sensory
deprivation. I so want to be completely blind and deaf when some
undead asshole is trying to kill me!
<p>
Sean used to think he was the only kid who was never afraid of the
dark; instead of fearing the monster under the bed, he liked to
pretend <i>he</i> was the monster under the bed. Being a monster would be
awfully handy when the bullies bothered you on the way home from
school, and he liked the dark--one could hide in the dark, and pretend
to stalk one's unsuspecting victims from the shadows. He was also the
one who cheered for the monster at the movies; they were so much more
interesting and cool than their shallow, insipid, happy victims--who
reminded him all too much of the kids who picked on him at
school. Sean used to think he was unique and weird that way--until the
day in college he met the other unique, weird kids who thought black
was the best color and night was the best time.
<p>
His true fears: failure, conformity, inadequacy in his chosen field
were too sophisticated for this darkness to hold--all it could express
was fear of the dark, of being alone, of monsters, and ultimately, of
death. Sean never feared his old friends, but death.. death was
beginning to disturb him.  He wished he could find a match; he really
wanted a cigarette.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Sinhika growled with rage--she knew this darkness! It had attacked her
in the defiled temple; she had not surrendered to it then, she would
not fall to it now. She was a warrior and the daughter of heroes!
Illusion enfolded her, and she eluded the darkness. Sinhika smirked;
it could not find her, and she.. still could not see. "<i>Achintya</i>!
This should not be possible--I can see in the dark!"
<p>
"Idiot. The bodies of these darkness demons are something more than
mere absence of light," snarled an already familiar voice.
<p>
"Thank you for that helpful bit of information, Kale." Sinhika
answered sarcastically.  "Any <i>useful</i> suggestions?"
<p>
"I will consider the matter.. after the boy dies." Kale's voice was
cruelly triumphant.
<p>
"What??" Sinhika unsheathed her swords, frustrated by her
blindness. She didn't dare swing at random for fear of hitting a
friend.  "Gohan? Why would you hate <i>him</i>?"
<p>
"Not Kakarott's whelp, you fool! It's that wretched artist that I want
dead! Kakarott's brat is Saiyajin and--" Kale broke off abruptly,
hissing curses. "DAMN THIS! If the brat dies--" The sense of his
presence vanished abruptly from Sinhika's side.
<p>

<p>
The cold bit into Nezumi's bones, and the darkness seemed to hold
every childhood nightmare she'd ever known. I'm not a child anymore,
she thought. Still, there were monsters in the dark--she'd seen the
dead man, and she remembered the killers and rapists from the
quarry. What else was closing in on her?  Nezumi drew her gun--I can't
shoot, I might hit my friends! She could only wait, heart pounding,
for something to get her.
<p>
<i>Something</i> washed over her, shook the clouds from her mind. "Take
care of the brat," an almost familiar voice snarled in her ear. "He's
right at your feet, and dying." A powerful hand on her shoulder pushed
her down, forcing her to her knees.. she fell on something soft. A
body!
<p>

<p>
Prince Khara flew toward the heart of downtown. After returning the
little girl to her home, and finding out that her mother was safe
after all, he had managed to track down Sinhika's landlord. All he had
learned about his sister was that she was "one of those neo-punk types
hangin' out at the coffee house on 3rd and Main"--whatever that
meant. He intended to search for her near there--perhaps some of her
friends lodged nearby.
<p>
As he flew toward the heart of downtown, something caught the
invisible demon's attention. He scanned the skyline--yes, there! A
very great power, suppressed, hovering over the heart of the city,
over one particular building. What did it mean?
<p>
The Rakshasa Prince sensed the darkness elementals move in for the
attack before he clearly saw the source of the great hidden power
above.  "<i>Aadhyaatmikuum andhakaara akaaryuum</i>! I will not allow
this!" Sword drawn, he rushed into the building, following the shadow
of darkness.
<p>
Piccolo dove down to the building and smashed through the window--
<p>
--into darkness. Complete and absolute darkness, neither up nor down,
silent, cold and terrible. Piccolo feared neither darkness nor death,
but where in this dark infinity was Gohan?  The Namek dared not
unleash his power--undirected, it would kill the humans and might hurt
Gohan if his defenses were down. He had to find Gohan--the boy's
power was fading fast! Piccolo's fear for Gohan rose up and paralyzed
him.
<p>
"<i>Aadhyaatmikuum anaarya</i>! Go back to the everlasting night that
spawned you!"  Something bright slashed the darkness, and the darkness
wailed soundlessly.
<p>
"Who's there?" Piccolo shouted. "What is this darkness?"
<p>
"Powerful one," the voice called back, "If you be not an enemy, reveal
yourself in light! The Children of Darkness cannot abide true light!"
<p>
The fear fled from Piccolo's heart as he smiled knowingly. The Namek
knew exactly what to do.
<p>
"TAIO-KEN!" Unbearable brightness flashed over the tiny room; darkness
screamed, writhed, and vanished, burned completely away.
<p>
Sean blinked, and blinked again; spots danced before his eyes, slowly
clearing. A sword blade waved about two inches in front of his nose.
<p>
"Er, Sin?"
<p>
"Oops, sorry!" Sinhika quickly lowered her blade. "I didn't know who
you were in the dark!" Her eyes darted across the room, to the figure
that stood framed in the door.  "KHARA! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?"
<p>
Piccolo looked around--there! Gohan was on the floor, terribly still;
the young lady from the quarry, Nezumi, was bent over him, pumping his
chest with her hands. As he watched, she bent down and forced her
breath into his mouth.
<p>
"Come on, kid, breathe!" Nezumi pleaded as she continued trying to
resuscitate him.  In an instant, Piccolo was beside them, placing his
hand on hers, pouring his own ki into Gohan's body.
<p>
Gohan shuddered; Nezumi stopped and felt his neck.  She stared at
Piccolo. "Thank God! His heart is beating on its own..." The boy
coughed weakly; Nezumi smiled. "He's breathing!" She gently turned him
over as he coughed, clearing his air passages.
<p>
Gohan's eyes fluttered open; he blinked, looking at the two anxious
faces hovering over him.  "Piccolo. You came!" He smiled weakly.
<p>
"CURSED BE YOUR MEDDLING, ALIEN!" snarled a baleful voice. "And cursed
be your knowledge, Prince of Illusion--but for you, the child would be
dead and the Opawang's curse fulfilled."
<p>
Piccolo turned slowly; the voice came from the small adjoining room.
Sean spun around; he was in the studio, near the gate, and the voice
came from right behind him!
<p>
The dead man who had been Voron stood there, at the very edge of the
rift, crimson eyes glowing with anger. "You will regret your part in
this," it cursed. "BECOME KRJALK!"
<p>
The living corpse swayed on its feet as black horns burst out of its
skull and curled back; its body bulged and heaved as two black,
leathery wings tore themselves out of the dead man's back. They spread
wide, then folded close again, blending with the black leather coat he
wore. Black nails lengthened and sharpened into claws; the dead man
grinned, revealing long canine fangs. A lurid light gathered in one
hand; black and yellow lightnings sparking and crawling up and down
his curled fingers.
<p>
Piccolo smirked; he recognized that lurking malevolence and complete
lack of detectable power. "You seem to like being beaten, don't you?
First by Raditz, and now by me." The tall Namek took up fighting
stance and growled, "You should never have attacked Gohan; that was
your final mistake.. Deputy!"
<p>
"Oh, crud! There goes my apartment!" Sean broke into a sweat as he
realized that he was between Piccolo and Deputy-Voron. The winged
demonic corpse was so close he could smell the thing, so close it
could reach out and touch--
<p>
"YIIIII!" A hand clamped down on his shoulder.. from behind. Whew! It
wasn't the Deputy-Voron demon, who was staring at him,
looking.. puzzled?  What the--?  Sean turned his head, saying "Uh,
Piccolo, you just scared ten.. years..."
<p>
Piccolo was ten feet away. No one visible was touching Sean.
<p>
"Oh, crud!"
<p>
"Goodbye, Sean!" snarled Kale's voice in his ear, as two powerful,
invisible hands picked up the goth artist and hurled him straight at
Deputy-Voron. Sean crashed headlong into the surprised demon, and they
both fell.. through the gate.
<p>
Sean screamed as he plummetted into Hell.

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Reunion">XXX. REUNION</A></H1>
<p>
The floor rushed up to meet Sean very, very fast. Oh God, this is
going to hurt--
<p>
He stopped. Suddenly. Six feet above the stone-paved floor. Someone's
hand was locked around his ankle. Sean looked up along the length of
his body.
<p>
Commander Kale smirked down at him. There was nothing ghostly about
him now; he was fully visible and quite substantial. He stood
on nothing but air, holding Sean without any sign of strain.
<p>
"Huh?"
<p>
Kale's smirk deepened into a cruel smile. "You're not getting away
from me that quickly! Once you're dead, I can't touch you--you haven't
been judged yet. I will pay you back for the trouble you've caused me
<i>before</i> you die!"
<p>
"KILL THAT THING!" Kale and Sean both turned to look; the King of the
Saiyajin rose from this throne pointing toward them. Kale's eyes
narrowed, and he flung himself and Sean to one side--
<p>
Black wings spread wide, Deputy-Voron alighted on the floor below the
rift and laughed. "FOOLS! YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU FACE!"
<p>
Turles and three other white-cloaked guardsmen landed between the king
and the demon. There was an evil glint in Turles's eye as power
gathered in his hand; the other three extended their hands, palms
toward the black-winged demon.
<p>
Deputy-Voron smirked and crossed his arms in front of him. "SHIELD!"
he cried, just as the blasts from the three Saiyajin hit him.
<p>
Dust settled; the horned demon was still there, smirking over crossed
arms. "Is that <i>all</i>?"
<p>
Turles smirked; he'd held back, expecting this result. "Try this,
demon!" He hurled the ball of energy, steering it into the waiting
demon. A huge cloud of dust and smoke expanded out from where the
demon had been...
<p>
..And slowly cleared, revealing the demon sneering contemptously.
"Pathetic."  Deputy-Voron lowered his arms. "Is it my turn yet?"
<p>
King Vegeta leaped forward with an inarticulate scream of rage, power
gathering in each hand. "ALL OF YOU--ATTACK!"
<p>
White fire screamed down toward the demon as all the Saiyajin hurled
power at the demonic corpse.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
In the room above, Sinhika grabbed futilely for Sean's foot as he fell
through the rift; Prince Khara grabbed his sister by both ankles as
she tried to dive after him.  "NO! YOU MUST NOT!" he yelled.
<p>
"LET GO OF ME, KHARA, OR I'LL--"
<p>
"SILENCE, BOTH OF YOU!" snarled Piccolo, who looked past Sinhika to
the scene unfolding in Hell. "GOHAN, GET NEZUMI OUT OF HERE, NOW! THIS
WHOLE PLACE IS ABOUT TO GO!"  The powerful Namek simply grabbed one
Rakshasa under each arm and hurtled back out the window he'd come in.
<p>
Gohan saw Piccolo fleeing as his words registered; the young Saiyajin
grabbed Nezumi around the waist and fled out the window close on
Piccolo's heels.
<p>
White fire exploded out of the rift behind him--and burst outward,
blowing the building apart. The old building seemed to hang in mid-air
for a second, and then collapsed--only to disappear in a tremendous
ball of flame as a second, larger explosion spread from the rift.
<p>
"What was that??" Gohan's eyes were huge.
<p>
"The Saiyan king tried to fight Deputy," Piccolo said shortly.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
As the Saiyajin hurled their attacks at Deputy-Voron, Kale punched a
hole in the nearest wall and tossed Sean through it. "Stay out of
trouble!" Kale hissed, and turned to join the fray.
<p>
Deputy-Voron crossed his arms again, this time holding his palms
outward. "REFLECTION!"
<p>
The barrage of white fire struck--and rebounded, each attack returning
to its originator.
<p>
BOOOM! The entire back wall of the throne room exploded as
the combined power of King Vegeta, Sullion and Turles smashed back
into them. Dust and stone came crashing down all around.
<p>
The smoke cleared to reveal a shimmering translucent hemisphere of
energy protecting the Saiyan king and the two warriors. King Vegeta
glared with hate at the mocking demon, and, with a gesture, dispelled
the shield he had raised. "TAKE HIM!" The king himself charged the
winged thing, Sullion and Turles at his side. Kale plunged in from one
side, sword drawn.
<p>
Deputy-Voron flexed his wings and snarled, baring his long fangs. "My
turn."
<p>
A snap of his wings and the demon was airborne, slamming down on
Commander Kale from above. He dodged Kale's awkward thrust upward and
smashed his heel into the Saiyajin's throat. Kale flipped backwards
and crashed to the floor, neck broken. He would be the least injured
of them, and would soon heal.
<p>
Energy gathered in Deputy-Voron's hand as King Vegeta, his shieldman
Sullion, and Turles closed in.  Black, red and yellow sparks crawled
over the demon's clawed hand. Suddenly, he drew his arm back and
pitched the ball of dark lightnings straight toward King Vegeta--
<p>
"EVISCERATOR!" The thing churned through the air; Turles was the first
to try and fend it off, only to stagger back with half his hand torn
away. Sullion's eyes widened in horror, and he shoved King Vegeta
violently away, then jumped between his King and the churning ball of
dark energy as it turned to follow.
<p>
"AAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHhhhhhhhhhh!!!" A scream of utter agony came from
Sullion as the ball of dark lightnings struck him and exploded, each
spark piercing his spirit, tearing through him and shredding him into
a bloody mist of broken power and shattered spirit.  His scream slowly
faded away into an infinite distance as the mist dispersed.
<p>
"Sullion!" King Vegeta stared in horror at the place where his faithful
shieldman had been destroyed.
<p>
Deputy-Voron howled his laughter. "Prepare to join him, for the few
short days your next incarnation shall have to live before Chaos
devours the universe!" He raised his hand, dark power gathering once
again.
<p>
Turles grabbed the king with his uninjured arm and bolted for the
nearest opening. He turned as the wicked crackle of an eviscerator
sphere reached his ears--it was right behind them! In desperation, he
blasted the sphere itself--
<p>
KRAK-BOOM! It exploded with an ugly harsh noise--bringing down what
remained of the righthand wall.. on top of them.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
On the burning plains of Hell, armies clashed. Chaos monsters had been
flung far and wide by the catastrophic implosion of the vortex in the
Pit of Worms--even in Hell, what goes up generally must come
down. Broo and less describeable things crashed down into the ranks of
Rakshasa demons that followed Prince Indrajit--and battle was joined.
<p>
The invisible demons fought the exotic, twisted powers of Chaos as the
broo battled desperately to survive. The blood of the dead flowed
freely, and broken spirits turned to mist, fading away until they
regained power, or were reborn in the Wheel of Life.
<p>
Prince Indrajit cut a swath through the broo legions as he rode them
down and smote them with his great steel sword, or picked them off
with a storm of enchanted arrows.  Beside him, the Saiyan Captain Zorn
fought with a joyous fury he'd nearly forgotten, breaking monsters
with his bare hands when they got close enough, obliterating them from
a distance with raw power if they did not. He grinned like a madman;
it was the best fight he'd seen in decades--and only the second good
fight since his death so many years ago.
<p>
A momentary lull in the battle--and another Rakshasa, garbed in silver
armor like Indrajit, suddenly appeared in the chariot beside Zorn.
<p>
"What the--? Have a care, demon! I nearly destroyed you!" Zorn
exclaimed, angry at being startled.
<p>
The newcomer looked him over cooly with deep sapphire-blue eyes. "No
danger of that," the Rakshasa noble stated, and then turned to Prince
Indrajit.
<p>
"Though this be an ill time for thee, I have great need of thy
chariot, my nephew. As it was before, will you give it to me?"
<p>
Prince Indrajit bowed. "As I promised, you need only ask. I know thy
purpose; may Lord Narayana ride with you and defend you!" The Rakshasa
Prince looked over at Captain Zorn.  "Come with me; the god's gift is
given to King Vibishana."  Indrajit stepped down from the chariot,
taking his sword and bow with him.
<p>
Zorn scowled--but his orders were to follow Indrajit, not Indrajit's
chariot or the mysterious Rakshasa King, so he, too, got down.
<p>
King Vibishana signed that Indrajit's charioteer should also dismount.
<p>
"Who will drive for thee, uncle?" asked Prince Indrajit.
<p>
"I will be the charioteer.. for a mightier warrior than I."  King
Vibishana shook the reins, and the demon tigers spread their wings.

<p>
Bardock and half his team looked down on the burning plain, watching
the battle below. Toma carried Trunks now, and Celipa carried
Goten. Down below, Panboukin and Totepo fought monsters; Bardock
watched as the two ouzaru squashed unnameable things and broo.
<p>
"We can't fly through that with the boys," he finally concluded. "The
battle is too unpredictable; it would be too easy to get blindsided
and lose them."
<p>
Toma looked at Bardock. "You're going to jaunt?"
<p>
"<i>We</i> are going to jaunt--but I'll carry the boys. If something goes
wrong, the three of us will at least be in the same place." Bardock
looked slightly worried.
<p>
"You're still against it, aren't you?" Toma noted.
<p>
"We still don't know if living mortals can be 'jaunted'--and my
grandson is the <i>last</i> person I want to experiment with!"
<p>
"We don't have much choice," Celipa pointed out. "They can't stay here
much longer--it's not exactly healthy--and we can't get past that
battle any time soon. I don't like trying a jaunt out on them any more
than you do, but..." She shrugged.
<p>
"Bardock..." Toma looked expectantly at his leader.
<p>
The scar-faced Saiyajin straightened visibly. "Here," he held his arms
out for Trunks and Goten. "You know what has to be done, do it. I'll
see you at the palace, on the balcony outside my chambers."
<p>
"Bye-bye," Goten waved to Celipa and Toma. Trunks waved to Celipa,
too--then Bardock and the children vanished in a burst of sulfurous
smoke.
<p>
Celipa looked at Toma. "What are you waiting for? Let's go." The two
of them vanished as one, leaving only a puff of sulfurous smoke
behind.
<p>

<p>
Raditz stopped abruptly in mid-air with a flash of released
energy. "Goku!"
<p>
Goku overshot, circled back and halted beside him. Bulma looked from
one brother to the other. "What's going on, guys?"
<p>
"Something has happened. Goten isn't ahead of us anymore," Raditz said
abruptly. He looked expectantly at his brother.
<p>
"I can still sense Trunks.. and Goten.. but I can't tell the
direction," Goku said, brow furrowed. "I still can't use Shukken
Idou." Beads of sweat ran down his face; the awareness of so much evil
bore down on him like a vast weight on his back.
<p>
After a moment, Raditz spoke. "They're behind us; back the way we
came." His eyes widened. "Something is going on; someone's tossing
power around in a big way--can you not feel it, little brother?"
<p>
"I feel it." Power flared around Goku, and the two brothers (plus
Bulma) hurtled back the way they had come.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"What the HELL?" Bardock stared, shocked, at the ruin before
him. Where his chambers had been was nothing but shattered stone and
tumbled ruin. <i>Something</i> had blown apart the back third of the
palace.
<p>
Trunks and Goten clung tightly to his neck, wide-eyed and trembling,
though Trunks tried hard to hide it. Goten was not trembling from
fear, however.
<p>
"Woooo! That was fun, Grandpa! Can I learn to do that?"
<p>
BAMF-BAMF! Celipa and Toma appeared, and nearly fell out of the sky;
there was no balcony to support them as expected. Fortunately, it only
took Toma an instant to recover his equilibrium and his dignity. He
snapped a hand out and caught Celipa.
<p>
She was not amused. "I can fly, you moron!"
<p>
Toma <i>was</i> amused. "Of course you can, that's why you're wobbling like
Sarada after a three-day drunk!"
<p>
Celipa glared at Toma,  and then surged up past him, forcing him to
let go or be dragged along like a fish hooked by a speedboat.
<p>
"What happened here?" she asked Bardock as he handed Trunks back to
Celipa. The violet-haired boy seemed relieved to see Celipa again.
<p>
"I don't know. It looks like it spread from the rift." Still holding
his grandson Goten, Bardock flew down to investigate.
<p>
Something winged stalked over the tumbled ruins of the throneroom,
casually flipping multi-ton slabs of rock this way and that. Bardock
could see several white-cloaked forms tumbled and broken amid the
rubble--but no red cloak besides his own. Where was the king?
<p>
The winged thing looked up, revealing a human-like face--human,
excepting the black backward-curving horns and the lurid crimson
eyes. Long black hair framed the pale cold face; narrow lips curved up
in a cruel smile.
<p>
"So the children live yet, in <i>this</i> realm! My mistake; when they left
the living world, I thought them dead." The demon spoke in a soft, yet
carrying voice. "A mistake soon remedied!" Dark power gathered in
Deputy-Voron's hand.
<p>
Goten whimpered almost involuntarily. "Bad thing!"
<p>
"TOMA! TAKE GOTEN--YOU AND CELIPA GET OUT OF HERE!" Bardock yelled,
thrusting a suddenly terrified Goten into his sub-leader's arms.
<p>
"EVISCERATOR!" Another deadly ball of black, red and yellow lightnings
hurtled from Deputy-Voron's claws, straight towards the three of
them.
<p>
Bardock darted forward, interposing himself between the oncoming
attack and his grandson. He raised his arms, preparing to block the
dark ball lightning.
<p>
"Nooooo! You can't stop it that way!" A high-pitched yell from behind
him--not Celipa. Who?  "Let go of me!"
<p>
"OOF! Hey, get back here!" That was Celipa!
<p>
ZACK! A ki blast flashed down, striking the oncoming ball, exploding
it-- KRAK-BOOM!
<p>
What the--? Bardock risked a glance behind him; Trunks! The king's
grandson hovered slightly above and behind Bardock.
<p>
"Youcan'tstopitthatway--Gohan nearly got killed when the Opawang threw
one at him!" Trunks yelled, the words running together in his
desperate hurry. "You have to blow them up--they can't be blocked!"
<p>
"Wretched child! Now I know why the Opawang included YOU in his
death-curse!" Deputy-Voron snarled. "Die, bastard brat of a dead
prince!" The demon flung his hand out and a beam of pure white power
blasted out, straight for Trunks.
<p>
Trunks froze, paralyzed with fear at the tremendous power of the
oncoming attack--
<p>
BOOOMMMM! Another third of the palace vanished as the blast hit and
detonated; a tremendous cloud of smoke and dust billowed outward.
<p>
"DAMN YOU INTERFERING SAIYAJIN!" Deputy-Voron cursed as the smoke
cleared to reveal Bardock standing on air between the demon and
Trunks, his singed arms crossed in a ki-block. Celipa and Toma, still
holding Goten, hovered nearby.
<p>
Bardock smirked. "We already are."
<p>
"If pure power will not destroy you, I will rip you apart with my bare
hands!"  The demon snarled and sped toward them with a snap of its
black wings, moving with deceptive speed.
<p>
Bardock darted through the air to meet it; they met in a flurry of
blows. Both figures whirled and struck too fast for even Toma's
experienced eye to follow--
<p>
--and sprang apart, facing each other in midair. Bardock wiped a
trickle of blood from his forehead; the others could see long slashes
where the demon's claws had marked him. His determination was
unshaken, but there was a tension not present before; the demon was
fast--very fast.
<p>
Voron's leather coat was tattered and torn; pale dead flesh gleamed
through the many rents in his clothes. Deputy-Voron's body was
unmarked by Bardock--but not unscathed. Dead skin drew tight over
the bones; his flesh seemed sunken and withered.
<p>
Bardock's eyes narrowed as he marked the changes; he gave a low
laugh. "Just finding out your limitations, demon? That's the problem
with undead corpses--they're so fragile. The strain of containing
your own power is destroying you." He smirked. "I can keep this up all
day--or all year."
<p>
"Can you?" sneered Deputy-Voron. "You did not touch me--and I marked
you, stole your power. Every drop you bleed makes <i>me</i> stronger!" The
undead demon-sorceror grinned.
<p>
Bardock did not answer, but watched the demon silently as a ball of
energy formed in his right hand. Without a word, he hurled the ki
sphere straight at Deputy-Voron.
<p>
"ABSORPTION!" The demon held up his hands cupped together, facing
toward Bardock; a black aura glimmered around him. Bardock's attack
struck the demon square on--
<p>
--and vanished as if it were never there. The demon laughed.
<p>
"Hey! That's what the Opawang did to Gohan!" Trunks exclaimed from
somewhere behind Bardock.
<p>
Bardock smirked again, noting the further changes in Deputy-Voron's
corpse-form. The demon's face was even more corpse-like than before,
and his hands were nearly skeletal, mummified skin pulled tight over
bones.
<p>
Deputy-Voron snarled, "It amuses you to keep feeding me your power? Do
you think to overload me, burn me out? FOOL! You still have no idea
what you face! This body is but a temporary shell I do not need
anymore! What I NEED is your power and those brats' lives!"
<p>
With a savage scream the demon dove toward Bardock--only to swerve
abruptly in mid-air, as a katana chopped halfway through its
shoulder. Deputy-Voron spiralled down, one wing nearly chopped away,
dried severed bones protruding from rotten skin.
<p>
A white-cloaked Saiyajin hovered above it, grinning evilly--Commander
Kale! "Taste the power of the Saiyajin, monster!" Katana at guard, the
Saiyan noble dove in pursuit of the demon.
<p>
"Watch out! He's faster than he looks--" Bardock tried to warn Kale.
<p>
Deputy-Voron howled in rage and ripped away the broken wing as he
dropped to the floor. As Commander Kale closed in, katana raised for a
decapitating blow, the Chaos demon whipped around and, faster than
Kale could move, plunged one clawed hand through armor and bone to
grab the dead warrior's heart. A look of bewildered surprise crossed
Kale's face, as if he could not believe what was happening--
<p>
"I do not 'taste' the power of the Saiyajin, fool--I drink it down to
the dregs!" snarled the demon--just before he crushed Kale's heart.
<p>
A brief cry, abruptly stilled, and Kale was no more; only the faint
mist of a broken, powerless spirit lingered for a few moments before
it, too, was gone.
<p>
Deputy-Voron turned to face the three remaining Saiyajin and the
children. "Now his power is mine, along with that of those other fools
who got in my way. Leave the children behind, Saiyajin, and you might
be able to run fast enough to get away while I'm.. busy with them."
<p>
"I <i>died</i> protecting my world from a monster like you, demon! What
makes you think I've changed?" Bardock said with cold contempt. Behind
him, Toma shifted Goten to his back, putting his body between the
demon and the boy. Likewise, Celipa put herself in front of Trunks. No
fear, only determination could be seen in Saiyan eyes.
<p>
"If the three of you are so noble, why, then, are you in Hell??"
Energy gathered in both of the demon's clawed hands. "Please command
them to run again. I am far faster than they are and they are so much
weaker than I..."  Deputy-Voron laughed nastily; one bare cheekbone
jutted through his disintegrating skin. "You are their only hope. Let
me put an end to hope."
<p>
The demon raised his skeletal hands, cradling a brilliant ball of
energy in each one. Bardock could feel the power seething in them,
power many times his own. Deputy-Voron laughed mockingly.
<p>
"Time to despair!"  He hurled the ki spheres at Bardock.
<p>
NO! Not again! Not like Frieza--
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<p>
Paft! Paft! ... BOOOMMM! BOOMMM! Both spheres deflected away, to
explode harmlessly high above in the non-sky of Hell.
<p>
Bardock suddenly found himself staring at a terribly familiar, broad,
orange-clad back. His dead heart leaped; Bardock knew this form so
like his own, he had seen it in so many visions, in life and
afterwards...
<p>
"Kakarott?"
<p>
His son--<i>his son!</i>--turned his head just enough to see
Bardock. "Yes." The corners of his mouth quirked up in a hint of a
smile. "You're my father, aren't you? I saw you on Namek."
<p>
"DADDY! NUNK RATS!" Goten's shout rang off the stones.
<p>
"Little brother, Father, can we postpone the reunion for just a few
more minutes?" Raditz's familiar, slightly sarcastic voice cut in. "We
have a slight problem to deal with."
<p>
Bardock glanced up; his long-haired eldest son hovered slightly above
and to the right of his brother, wearing strange new black and white
armor. Kakarott and Raditz were both alive and here, <i>together</i>!
Fighting together--as they should have been from the beginning. Raditz
grinned back at him.  This is impossible, thought Bardock. I am in
Hell.. How can I feel such <i>joy</i>??
<p>
"YIIIPE! Get your hands off my tail!" Celipa could be heard exclaiming
indignantly from somewhere behind them.
<p>
"Sorry! It was an accident; Gohan is the only person as small as you
to carry me in a long time, and he doesn't have a tail," came the
voice of a woman Bardock did not know.
<p>
"RADITZ! SON GOKU!" Deputy-Voron snarled, less than pleased. "YOU
CANNOT BE HERE!"
<p>
Raditz's eyes widened in surprise, and then narrowed; he recognized
the startling non-power and glowing crimson eyes. "Deputy. You just
don't know when to quit, do you?" He slowly drew his hands back. "LET
ME TEACH YOU!"
<p>
"MAN--" Raditz summoned power in each hand--
<p>
"KI--" He brought his hands together--
<p>
"BATSU!" The stupendous, violet-edged beam of white power slashed
down, straight into Deputy-Voron. The demon's form seared, withered
and blew away, disintegrated in the blast of Raditz's power. Only a
black mist remained.
<p>
The black mist coiled, twisted and grew, swelling into a huge,
familiar demonic form. Horned, bat-eared dog head, long sinewy arms
and shoulders covered with fur, narrow leathery wings, scaly
dinosaurian legs and tail--the dark spirit of Deputy, Child of
Cacodemon arose like a demonic phoenix.
<p>
"FOOL!" It flexed its great leathery wings. "DAMNED FOOLS ALL! You've
set me free of that rotten shell--set me free in this realm of evil
spirits and dark despair. DO YOU KNOW HOW POWERFUL I HAVE BECOME?"
Deputy giggled. "LEARN--AND DIE!"
<p>
The great chaos demon crouched on its dinosaurian hindlegs and vomited
fire at Goku and Raditz--and the children behind them.
<p>
"Oh, crud." Raditz crossed his arms to block the attack, knowing he
didn't stand a chance, but trying anyway.
<p>
Bardock stared in silent horror at the monstrosity revealed by
Raditz's attack. Joy turned to ashes; both his sons and his grandson
and the king's grandson would surely die here--but not because he,
Bardock, surrendered! As long as he had will and soul left...
<p>
Bardock darted up and back, sweeping Trunks and Toma, who carried
Goten, out of harm's way--for the moment. Celipa, who carried a
strange blue-haired woman, followed after Toma.
<p>
Deputy's firebolt struck, rebounded, and exploded, filling the
shattered palace with sheets and darts of flame. A maelstrom of smoke
and fire howled where Bardock and the others had been before he pulled
them out of the way. Bardock took his wide-eyed, trembling grandson
from Toma's arms and held him close, shielding the boy with his body.
<p>
The smoke finally cleared to reveal Goku standing between Deputy and
the rest of them, one hand extended, smoking palm facing the huge
demon.
<p>
Goku glanced up at Raditz and smiled fiercely. "My turn, big brother."
<p>
Muscles flexed and bulged as golden fire gathered around him,
permeated his hair, charged it so that it stood on end and glowed with
a blazing golden light, a light that surrounded him, seething with
power. Turquoise eyes stared coldly at the monstrous chaos demon.
<p>
"Super-Saiyajin!" Bardock's awed exclamation seemed to echo around the
broken palace.
<p>
"You don't get a fair chance to fight me--you've done too much evil,"
said the Super-Saiyajin Goku to Deputy.
<p>
"KA-" Hands cupped,
<p>
"ME-" drawn back,
<p>
"HA-" filled with power,
<p>
"ME-HA!" Goku hurled his magnificent ki attack straight into Deputy's
jaws!
<p>
Deputy opened his eyes wide with shock, them something like fear
contorted his bestial face. The great demon flung himself back and to
side with a snap of his wings--
<p>
The Kamehameha turned to follow, and struck--
<p>
The demon exploded!
<p>
As the ball of seething energy expanded outward, consuming what little
was left of the palace, Raditz fled the expanding fireball as it
licked at his heels, while Goku retreated at a leisurely pace from his
own attack.
<p>
At last the fire and smoke subsided, revealing a vast crater where
half the palace had been. Deputy was gone--no. A barely visible wisp
of black mist drifted at the bottom of the crater and slowly sleeped
away.
<p>
Bardock watched with a cold smile.  "You belong to Lord Enma, now."
His voice was startlingly loud in the blasted palace, where nothing
moved. Goku, Raditz and the others looked on in silence; a hot wind
blew across ashes and dust...
<p>
CRASH! Everyone jumped as a stone trapdoor crashed open near the back
of the ruined palace, pushed up from below.
<p>
Sean stuck his head up. "Is it safe to come out now?"
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Bardock alighted, holding Goten; the little boy stared wonderingly at
the golden-haired figure of his father. Bardock looked silently over
Goten's head at his son Kakarott; what would he say to him?  What
<i>could</i> he say to the son he had rejected as a weakling, the son he
had abandoned to find his own way on an alien world--the son who had
become the greatest of all Saiyajin, in strength and in heart both?
<p>
Raditz told you what it meant to be sent to Earth as a mere infant--no
one knows that I kept silent, condemned you to the ignominy of being
sent away as a useless, expendable weakling, though I knew better. I
knew better. I remember that last fleeting glance at you as I ran for
my pod, when you had stopped crying and gotten angry at being
ignored...
<p>
Goku touched gently down, facing Bardock silently. For once, Goku's
heart could not guide him--it was the source of his hesitation. He
didn't know how he felt about this golden-skinned Saiyajin. All his
life, Goku had wondered where he came from and who his parents were;
eight years ago, Raditz arrived and gave him horrifying answers to the
mystery. After that, he'd wanted to know nothing more of his
ancestors.. until Frieza.
<p>
Vegeta's pride, his courage in facing Frieza, and Frieza's cold malice
and fear of the Saiyajin woke something in Goku--pride in and
understanding of his heritage. Frieza had contemptuously boasted of
killing this man before him, a boast that was meant to bring grief and
despair--but Goku had never known his father, and did not care.. then.
<p>
Later, when he fell to his knees before Frieza, the last of his
strength spent, then Vegeta, King Vegeta, and his father Bardock came
from Hell and gave <i>their</i> strength to Goku, the strength and pride
that made them defy Frieza to death and beyond. Goku sometimes
wondered, when he was alone with his thoughts, what his father had
been like, and what he thought of his Earth-raised son. What had
brought Bardock from Hell to help his youngest son?  Goku
thought--hoped--that it was something stronger than hatred of Frieza,
something nobler than vengeance.
<p>
"Where did my daddy go?" Goten asked, confused by the golden-haired
angel before him. "Who's that?"
<p>
"Goten, it's just me!" Goku said cheerily as his hair shifted back to
 its normal black.
<p>
"DADDY!" Goten yelled happily, reaching out for Goku. "How did you do
that?  Gohan can do that, too! Can I learn how to turn my hair all
funny yellow?" Goku gently lifted his youngest son from Bardock's
arms. Goten promptly turned around to look at his silent grandfather.
<p>
"Grandpa, can you turn your hair yellow and get real strong, too?"
<p>
Bardock shook his head slowly. "No, little one, I never learned how to
become a Super-Saiyajin." He looked beyond Goten at his son
Kakarott. "I did not forsee that."
<p>
Goku held up Goten and looked at him, smiling. "Well, you've certainly
come through this well, little man. Chi-chi will be so happy; there's
not a scratch on you! Someone took good care of you!" He looked
significantly at Bardock as Goten perched on his shoulder.
<p>
"He is Saiyajin..." Bardock then smiled very slightly at Goku. "..and
he is my grandson--the son of <i>my</i> son..." He trailed off into a long
silence that Goku feared to break, knowing something precious would be
lost. "A son I am very proud of."
<p>
It was Goku's turn for silence; he was uncharacteristically hesitant
when he finally spoke--and his face said far more than his
words. "Thank you for saving my son, and Trunks. I.. You are not what
I expected."
<p>
Bardock's faint smile deepened.  I am not what you feared, am I? "The
Prince is the only other Saiyajin you've really known, isn't he? We
low-class warriors were.. different from the elites."
<p>
One thing is the same, Bardock reflected. One thing is the same
between low-class and elite, Earth Saiyajin and the lost souls of
Vegetasai--we are proud of our sons. Kakarott is proud of his son
Goten, I am proud of Kakarott, King Vegeta is proud of Prince Vegeta,
and I think the Prince is proud of his son Trunks.
<p>
What is this 'pride'? I did not raise Kakarott, he has nothing of me
save my blood--but I am proud of him--for what <i>he</i> is, not for what I
did.  I begin to understand what this 'pride' is we feel for our sons,
and it has nothing to do with that arrogance in our own power that we
also call 'pride'.
<p>
How can I feel this way when I am in Hell? Bardock looked at his other
son Raditz, at his old friends Toma and Celipa, and suddenly
understood. It's in my heart, even in this place of sorrow.
<p>
"Take them home, Kakarott." Bardock nodded at the yawning black rift
far above. "Go, quickly. This is no place for any of you!"
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Even as Goku descended to talk to Bardock, the rest of them settled to
ground near Sean. Raditz stared incredulously at the young artist.
<p>
"<i>Sean??</i> How in HELL did you get here? How did you survive?"
<p>
"Funny you should phrase it that way." Sean smirked. "Kale didn't like
me."
<p>
"TRUNKS!" Bulma embraced her son. "Are you okay?  Oh my goodness,
you've been hurt!"
<p>
"I'm okay, Mom!" The violet-haired boy squirmed in embarassment. "I
just got a few bruises from that big demon hitting me. That's
all. Really!"
<p>
"The boy will survive; he was not much injured, and he fights well for
one of his youth," Celipa interrupted. From the slightly annoyed
expression on her face, the Saiyan woman sympathized with Trunks'
embarassment.
<p>
Toma glanced over at Sean, a bit puzzled himself. "What have you to do
with Commander Kale? Were you on the other side of that rift?"
<p>
"I created it--not that I meant to," Sean hasted to add as Toma
scowled. "Kale's the one who pushed me and that demon through--that's
how I got here," Sean nodded to Raditz, answering his earlier
question. "I'm alive because Kale wanted to kill me personally, one
small piece at a time--so he stashed me out of harm's way when things
started going wild with the demon. Then I looked for an even deeper
hole to dive into, and found it.  Where's Kale, anyway?"
<p>
"Deputy came through the rift from your dwelling?" Raditz asked, his
blood running cold. He did not wait for an answer, but growled
angrily. "What happened to Gohan?? And 'Zumi?"
<p>
Sean took a step back; Raditz's anger and fear were palpable things,
promising someone's death for the wrong answer. Sean hoped it wasn't
his own. He desperately wanted a cigarette, but dared not make
Persephone's mistake.  His mouth felt as dry as the ash-covered floor
of this place. "I don't know--I couldn't see them from where I was
standing after the darkness demons attacked, but I could hear her
voice and Gohan's both, so they're alive, at least."
<p>
"Commander Kale sent that demon here--and it destroyed him," Toma
answered Sean's question as Raditz scowled silently at Sean.
<p>
"Destroyed?" Sean looked sharply at Toma. "You mean he's not coming
back for me?  How can a ghost be destroyed?"
<p>
Toma frowned; he didn't like being reminded of what he really
was. "Souls cannot be truly 'destroyed', but we can lose all power,
will, and memory and pass on to our next incarnation." He fell silent.
<p>
"And this is worse than being dead in Hell?" Sean still wished he had
a cigarette, even if it made his bronchitis flare up again.
<p>
"You could not possibly understand!" Toma snarled angrily; pain
touched his eyes as he glanced at Celipa. Gravel shifted and rattled
not far away.
<p>
"He doesn't, but I do." Bulma interjected. "It's because Vegetasai is
gone, isn't it?  All the Saiyajin except two are dead--you can't be
reborn as Saiyajin--not anymore. Whatever comes next, you won't be
Saiyajin ever again."
<p>
"Never again shall any walk the shores of Umiy Moor'asaakye, nor look
up at the Winged Rings, nor behold the hot white sun we called Kajaio,
'King Fire', setting red in the evening." The hard, strong voice of
King Vegeta rang in Bulma's ears; she turned to see the Saiyan King,
battered and bloody, leaning on the equally battered and bloody
Turles.
<p>
"Nevermore shall fathers teach their sons the Traditions of the
Saiyajin, never again shall brave Saiyan warriors vow their loyalty to
their king and world; nevermore shall they go forth to fight and die
with courage. Never again shall their souls return to Vegetasai,
nevermore shall we be Saiyajin." The auburn-haired king was stern, but
his words and eyes belied his stoic face. "And when the last of us who
wait in Hell have departed, who will remember these things? The glory
of Vegetasai is gone forever, never to return; the memory of the
Saiyajin is a fading twilight, soon to vanish into darkness forever."
<p>
The King drew himself up to his full height, and stared down at
Bulma. "You could never have seen the truth, save that you are truly
my son's mate." He looked at Trunks, who stared back at his
grandfather in unabashed curiousity. The faintest hint of a smile
graced King Vegeta's lips. "He has a Saiyan soul--even if his hair is
the most absurd thing I have ever seen."
<p>
Bulma looked at her son. "I guess he would." She looked sharply at the
King. "And Gohan and Goten? Are their souls Saiyan, too?"
<p>
"Kakarott's sons?  Of course."
<p>
"Bulma?" Goku was there, holding Goten. "We have to leave now." He
looked beyond her at the Saiyan King, a question on his face.
<p>
"Go!" commanded the King. "It is forbidden--yet equally forbidden was
sending the children here in the beginning--and I have not the power
to stop you." Nor have I the desire, his eyes said silently.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
The living and the dead gathered around the rift. Trunks hung over
Raditz's shoulder and waved goodbye to Celipa and Toma; Bulma thought
that she saw Celipa wipe away a tear--but perhaps it was her
imagination. Goten was quiet, and buried his face in Goku's gi
whenever Bardock drifted near; Goku's gi was getting quite soggy.
<p>
"Kakarott." Bardock looked at his son, ancient sorrow in his eyes. "I
regret that I was never a father to you.. but if I had been, you would
not be what you are, and I.. do not regret what you are."
<p>
Goku drifted close to his father. "But you do regret that you didn't
see me grow up, and that I never knew you."
<p>
Bardock nodded almost imperceptibly. "I did see you grow up, in my
visions.. I wish you could know--"
<p>
"But I can." Goku reached out, touching his fingers to the side of
Bardock's head, drawing directly from his mind all that Bardock wanted
him to know, as Goku had done with Kulilin on Namek. Images and
memories--the curse of foresight, his friend Toma's dying revelation
of Frieza's plan to destroy Vegetasai, the frantic race to Vegetasai,
his desperate lonely battle against all of Frieza's minions, and
finally, that last, terrible duel against Frieza.
<p>
A grimness shadowed Goku as he remembered his own deaths and his own
terrible fight against Frieza.  There were other memories,
too--Bardock's long-ago pride in his young son Raditz, his terrible
grief when Kinoko died, his initial disappointment in his weak second
son, his hope and pride in Kakarott as his visions revealed his son
growing to manhood, facing Frieza, his final farewell to his infant
son...
<p>
"Father!" Goku finally pulled back, shaken. He bowed his head. "Now I
understand--thank you for letting me have this much of you."
<p>
"Farewell, Kakarott.. my son." They drifted slowly apart, and Goku
turned reluctantly towards the rift, taking Bulma from Raditz so that
Raditz could take Sean from Toma. "Farewell, Raditz--see that you do
not return." There was a hint of a wry smile, then he was all
business. "Go; I will close this rift behind you; you will not be able
to return, and nothing will come through from this realm again."
<p>
"Goodbye, father." Both his sons and those they protected vanished
into the black rift, leaving Hell forever.
<p>
My sons and grandsons live, and their lives are good indeed. At long
last, my youngest knows me, and I him. I am content.
<p>
"Get clear," he ordered Toma and Celipa. "It's time to close this
rift!" They took one look at the energies gathering around Bardock and
dove for the far end of the blasted palace. Bardock reached out and
touched the rift.
<p>
In that instant, Bardock realized the power that had opened the rift
was even further beyond him than he was beyond an ant. In that
instant, everything that he was and had been was stripped away by the
power that held the rift open.
<p>
The rift exploded. Soundless, invisible, intangible, the frightful
energies fed back into themselves; a kink in the universe straightened
itself out. Yggdrasil groaned as a cracked root healed and shifted
back into position. Chaos howled as an abomination that never should
have been was undone; the universe reclaimed a piece of itself from
oblivion.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Back on Earth, Kulilin started from a sound sleep. What was going on?
He looked around the darkened bedroom; Eighteen was sound asleep. He
got up and padded silently into his daughter's room. No, Marron was
also asleep; it wasn't her crying that disturbed him.
<p>
No, the disturbance ran deeper than that. It was a horrid feeling in
the air, a sense of some monstrously evil ki of nightmarish power--and
not all that far away. Kulilin's throat tightened; it reminded him of
Frieza, though it was not Frieza, or even Cell's counterfeit of
Frieza's ki. This was far more powerful--but like Frieza, it was
utterly inimical, and carried the stench of death--his death,
everyone's death--with it.
<p>
"I'll bet Goku's awake, too," Kulilin said to himself as he reached
for the telephone.

<p>
"DAD!" Gohan flung himself at his father. "I thought you were dead,
or trapped, or something! The whole thing blew up!"
<p>
"WHOA! Careful, son, you almost knocked me and your brother out of the
sky!" Goku steadied himself and Goten. He looked quickly around;
Piccolo was holding Nezumi, who regarded Raditz with obvious relief,
Sinhika was hovering by herself and glaring at a newcomer who looked
much like her save that he was male and had ordinary dark hair. The
newcomer was glaring back with equal ferocity.
<p>
"MY APARTMENT!" Sean gaped at the empty crater where the building had
been.
<p>
"Um, let's go somewhere we can get something to eat and catch up,"
Goku suggested.
<p>
"Capsule Corp!" Sinhika, Nezumi and Bulma chorused almost
simultaneously.
<p>
"Great!" Goku darted off toward the one brightly-lit section of the
city.
<p>
A few minutes later, Bulma stumbled through the front door of her
house, followed by everyone else, except Piccolo, who stayed outside
as usual. Any other time, they would have met in the old suite in the
Capsule Corp HQ building, but that was just a pile of rubble now.  Was
it really only yesterday that the earthquake struck?
<p>
At least Dad has gotten power turned on, Bulma thought. "Anyone want
some hot cocoa? I think I've got some in the kitchen."
<p>
Raditz's head jerked up. "Is that like food?" His stomach growled.
<p>
Goku looked over at him. "Hey, that's right, you ran out without
eating dinner! Have you had anything to eat at all?"
<p>
"One senzu bean."
<p>
Across the room, Khara apologized somewhat ashamedly to his
sister. "..Father actually approves of what you are doing, dear
sister, and was quite put out that I.. interfered."
<p>
Goten and Trunks flopped down on the couch with the intention of
waiting for hot cocoa and listening to the grownups--and promptly fell
asleep.
<p>
"So what happened, Dad?  Did you fight the demon? What happened to
that Saiyan ghost, Kale? How did Mr. Sean survive?  Did you meet any
of our old enemies?  Where did you find Goten and Trunks?  Was it very
bad?" Gohan was bursting with questions.
<p>
"Well, Gohan, I--" Goku froze, eyes slowly widening in shock. "It's
back!"
<p>
"What?" Gohan's head snapped up, his eyes also widening. "What is
that? It's.. horrible!"
<p>
"<i>Ashubhaam...</i>" Sinhika muttered, her pretty Indian face turning
pale. Prince Khara simply looked worried.
<p>
"Oh, crud." Raditz's eyes widened. "It's not possible!"
<p>
Nezumi looked at him, concerned. "Raditz?"
<p>
"Huh?" Sean looked confused, and then shivered involuntarily, feeling
suddenly cold and empty in the brightly lit, crowded room. He groped
in his pockets for a cigarette.
<p>
"Guys, what is it? Why is everyone looking so scared all of a sudden?"
Bulma looked scared herself.
<p>
Goten and Trunks snapped awake simultaneously. "Daddy? Nunk Rats??"
Goten jumped off the couch and ran over to his uncle, grabbing his leg
tightly. Trunks ran over to his mother and hugged her around the
waist, as if afraid she would disappear.
<p>
"SON GOKU! GOHAN! GET OUT HERE, IT'S COMING FAST!" Piccolo shouted
from outside.
<p>

<p>
In the forgotten hells of myth, another Saiyajin watched another
horror rise out of the darkness...
<p>
Prince Vegeta arced high above the river, studying the Night
Serpent. Apep's head swayed this way and that as the gigantic snake
tried to watch Vegeta with his one good eye. Mogris flew up after
Vegeta, a swirling wind blowing in her wake.
<p>
"What are you doing here, woman? This is my fight--as if you could
fight, anyway!"
<p>
"I can fight, Wolfslayer! I admit that this monster is beyond my power
to slay--perhaps I might provide some useful distraction." Mogris
hefted her spear confidently.
<p>
Vegeta opened his mouth to rebuke the pushy, low-class woman--and
thought better of it as a plan for dealing with Apep came to mind. His
eyes narrowed as he calculated.. Yes, that just might work. He
smirked.
<p>
"Yes, you can provide some useful distraction--if you've the wit to
pay attention and do it right the first time!" Vegeta snapped
haughtily. "Its scales absorb energy attacks; there are only a few
vulnerable points." Vegeta indicated a target. "Think you can hit it?"
he sneered.
<p>
"No, Vegeta--I've always been doubtful about my ability to hit the
broad side of a barn at two fathoms range," Mogris replied, dry as
ever. "Get out of my way, Vivamort's Bane, and let me show you how
Lightning Spear is meant to be used!"
<p>
Mogris flew up and over, circling the dread serpent's head. Its gaze
flicked between her and Vegeta, but then Vegeta flamed golden--and all
of Apep's attention was on the Super-Saiyajin. Mogris grinned to
herself, and dove, arm drawn back to throw the spear, sparks crawling
over its sharp-edged head, shield in front to protect her.
<p>
"LIGHTNING SPEAR!" A thunderbolt flashed from her hand and blasted
Apep's glinting black eye. Lightning ricocheted back and forth between
her hand and the target until Apep convulsed, his head snapping back
as the blinded serpent hissed with rage and pain.  Mogris flew up and
back, the Lightning Spear once again a spear in her hand.
<p>
"APEP--TURN AND FACE THE PRINCE OF ALL SAIYAJIN!" Vegeta roared as the
blind serpent snapped randomly at the air. The gigantic snake heard,
and turned toward the sound of hated sun spirit. Blinded, the serpent
could not see Vegeta rush to meet him, diving headlong into Apep's
gaping maw--nor could he see the small disk of energy spinning at
Vegeta's fingertips. Down Vegeta plunged into the jaws of the serpent,
blazing down its very throat.
<p>
"KI-ENZAN!"
<p>
Apep's neck exploded as a flat disk of energy flashed outward,
decapitating the dread serpent from within. The jaws crashed shut as
the great head fell away, Vegeta exploding out of the gaping wound in
a golden fury. The headless body convulsed madly, spasming to and fro,
churning the river into foam, red foam as blood poured from the
severed neck.
<p>
At last the great body fell quiet, a last few spasmodic twitches still
shaking scales loose--then stillness. Apep, Serpent of Darkness, was
dead.
<p>
Soon the sun-path would be open.
<p>

<p>
Goku and Gohan rushed outside and darted into the air, joining
Piccolo. It came from the west, a baleful red star shining in the
night; its malefic power hammered their finely tuned senses like some
mad discordant music amplified to an impossible volume.
<p>
Golden fire lit the night, and the earth trembled; all around the
city, men and women shivered in their beds, terror making them
children again as nightmare flew above, and the earth shook
below. Goku and Gohan hovered shoulder to shoulder, blazing with
golden Super-Saiyan power; Piccolo hovered just above, facing the
unseen horror.
<p>
As it hurtled ever nearer, the red star became a trinary
constellation, three red bale-stars clustered together. In the dark
night without morning, nothing more could be seen...
<p>
The triple bale-star suddenly vanished, and there was a flap of
monstrous wings as something huge and tailed flashed upward at the
edge of the golden light. Gohan strained to watch it as it mounted
high into the night.
<p>
"What is it?? Can you see it, Dad?"
<p>
"No, but I can feel it," Goku said calmly. "That is enough."
<p>
Piccolo looked upward, but remained silent. His far-seeing eyes
revealed more truth than he cared to report.
<p>
A hideous scream rang out--the very earth cringed away from it.
<p>
"DIEEEEE, GOHAN! DIE, SON OF GOKU!" The monster stooped upon them,
diving out of the black sky.
<p>
It was huge, half the size of an ouzaru; great black wings clung close
to its back, folded to speed its dive. The rest of it.. tail and
dog-like head, long claws and powerful legs--it was almost a larger
version of Deputy. Almost.
<p>
Between and above the two crimson eyes blazed a great red gem, the
third star of the demon's constellation. Tendrils writhed about the
hideous jaws, extending from the thing's black lips. A stinger tipped
the long supple tail, and Goku remembered how lethal that weapon had
been once before. The arms were thicker and more powerful than
Deputy's, hands tipped with the same venom-slimed claws. Finally, they
could all sense this thing's terrible power; it stood forth
unconcealed and horribly foul.
<p>
Gohan's eyes widened as the horror fell on him; he dodged aside as the
great claws flashed by--only to swerve abruptly, as the tail stinger
narrowly missed his face. The demon was fast!
<p>
The demon spread his wings and alighted in the middle of the Capsule
Corp compound. "FOOLS!" it hissed. "DELIGHTFUL FOOLS! DO YOU THINK TO
DEFEAT ME? YOU ARE DEAD ALREADY, FOR YOU ARE THE CHOSEN VICTIMS OF
CACODEMON, CHILD OF WAKBOTH, FATHER OF ALL PAIN AND EVIL. WITH THE
POWER OF YOUR SOULS SHALL I ROUSE MY FATHER AND GIVE HIM THIS WORLD
IN WHICH TO DELIGHT!"
<p>
Gohan winced; the Chaos god was very loud. "First you have to fulfill
the bargain you made with the Opawang, don't you? And WE WON'T LET
YOU!" Gohan screamed, his hands filling with energy. "MAA-SEN-KO!"
<p>
A beam of yellow-white energy flashed down from Gohan to the monstrous
demon--
<p>
A blinding, coruscating sheet of red lightning wreathed the demon's
head as Gohan's beam struck and became entangled in the lightnings. It
fed the lightnings, made them whiter and more furious as they writhed
across Cacodemon's bestial face. For long seconds the raging
electrical storm played about the demon's head, finally, slowly dying
out as each bolt grounded itself in the great ruby set in Cacodemon's
forehead. At last there was silence, silence in which the great gem
pulsed and glowed.
<p>
Cacodemon laughed, a harsh clanging sound like steel beams crashing
together. The demon snapped his wings together, surging into the
air. Crimson eyes locked onto Gohan, and hideous lips seemed to
grin. "NOW YOU DIE!"
<p>
The building-sized monster rose slowly into the sky; Gohan's lips
turned up in a hard smile. The monster's <i>tail</i> might be fast, but the
monster itself moved slowly!
<p>
A streak of blazing gold zipped around and behind the monster; Gohan
dove and struck, smashing into Cacodemon's neck with a flying
kick--sinking into thick curled hair that cushioned the blow, hitting
bottom in thick, rubbery hide--rebounding! He dove back, raining blows
that would shatter buildings on the back of the demon-god's
skull. Every blow was muted, cushioned and thrown back.
<p>
"AIYYYYEE!" yelped Gohan in surprise. "DAD! PICCOLO! Watch out! It's
like he's made of rubber cushions--everything just bounces off!"
<p>
Cacodemon laughed again. "FOOLS! THIS FORM WAS MADE TO DEFEAT YOU!"
The huge torso twisted, and Gohan dodged--but not quite far enough as
one wing snapped back with blinding speed and slapped Gohan into the
ground.
<p>
As Gohan started to climb out of the crater he'd made in one of the
Capsule Corp warehouses, Cacodemon dropped, huge taloned feet
slashing down. Gohan dodged one, two, and with a sudden spurt of
speed, got out from under the demon before it crushed him--only to be
greeted by the tail. The stinger missed, but the side of the tail
slapped him and flung him headlong to plow a forty yard ditch in the
tarmac.  The demon's tail was <i>very</i> fast!
<p>
Size, thought Gohan dazedly. It's his size; everything's so big on him
that I'm not dodging a blow, I'm dodging a wall--a wall almost as fast
as me!
<p>
The tail curled back for another strike--
<p>
"KA-ME-HA-MEHA!!" Goku's attack flashed down to engulf the demon--
<p>
"HAAAAAAHH!" Piccolo's beam slashed down--
<p>
Both attacks changed, becoming brilliant crimson lightning engulfing
the demon, lightning that raged and cracked until, one by one, each
stroke was absorbed into the great red gem on Cacodemon's
forehead. The gem blazed like a star, too bright to look at directly.
<p>
The Chaos demon.. grinned. It opened its jaws wide, and spewed a blast
of white energy down--straight at Gohan!
<p>
The fearful energies struck--and detonated! The blast bulged up and
swelled out, a great yellow-white fireball that engulfed the entire
south end of the compound. A huge cloud of ash and dust rose into the
air. The demon's eye-gem pulsed less brightly; it was bearable to see,
now.
<p>
"GOHAN!" A single exclamation escaped Goku's lips; a father's
involuntary worry, though he knew Gohan to be stronger than that.
<p>
Cacodemon's head snapped abruptly to the left; his dog-face twisted
into a snarl. "FOOLS! THE WEAKLINGS CANNOT ESCAPE ME!" The demon's
crimson eyes blazed brightly, and twin eye beams slashed into Bulma's
house, piercing and detonating.
<p>
"NO!" Goku's eyes went wide with horror as he saw the explosion engulf
the house--and felt his younger son's and his brother's ki wink
out. "NOOOOO!"
<p>
Golden fire engulfed Goku; his hair spiked higher and muscles twisted
and grew.  "GOTENNNNNN!" Power gathered in his cupped hands.
<p>
"Hold, Son Goku!" Piccolo spoke sharply. "Do not feed him more power!
Things are not what they seem; that blast could not have killed
Raditz! Watch the demon!"
<p>
Cacodemon swung his huge dog-like head from side to side, as if
searching for something. His eyes narrowed to slits of crimson fury,
lips curling back and nostrils flaring in a frustrated snarl. Taloned
fingers hooked and straightened convulsively.
<p>
Finally it came to a decision, even as Gohan rose from the settling
dust cloud behind it. Crimson eye-beams lashed out, searching and
destroying every building, every pile of rubble that might hide its
prey.
<p>

<p>
Lina, Acting Chief of Security for Capsule Corp, looked out the window
of the Security Building as she yelled into her walkie-talkie, "..get
everyone out, NOW! There's a Gojira-class monster in the compound,
he's not friendly, DON'T ARGUE, JUST MOVE!! Find out who's where
LATER, or we'll find ourselves all together in hell!"
<p>
Lina glanced up again just to see the great demon glare balefully in
her direction. "Oh, crud, he's--"
<p>
She didn't even feel the crimson eye-laser that incinerated her, much
less see the building explode around her crumbling ashes. But the
warning had been given.. just in time.  Others would survive.
<p>

<p>
Raditz gritted his teeth as he blocked two more stray eye-beams. He'd
already had to drop Trunks, letting the boy carry Goten and fly
himself; Bulma was enough of a burden, hampering him from moving
freely and fighting.
<p>
"Why the hell is he still attacking us?" the big Saiyajin yelled at
the two Rakshasas. "Didn't your illusions work?"
<p>
"Of course they did!" snapped Sinhika, orange hair blowing back in the
wind. "He's still searching for us; he doesn't know exactly where we
are."
<p>
"Great way to search," Sean said sarcastically. "Annihilate everything
in sight, and sooner or later you'll hit something important--like
us."
<p>
"I felt what you two did," Raditz snarled back at Sinhika. "It felt
like all our powers disappeared at once. That <i>thing</i> should think
we're dead! Why doesn't it?"
<p>
Prince Khara joined in. "We did hide our.. 'ki' as you call it, or the
monster would not now be searching for us; instead, it would be
unleashing its full power upon us." The prince's stern face regarded
Raditz disapprovingly; he did not welcome criticism of his
sister. "Something else draws that abomination to us."
<p>
"If you can't figure out what and stop it in the next five seconds, we
have to find a faster way out of here! It's already suspicious; I
think it saw those blocked beams. I cannot hold off an attack like it
just tossed at Gohan!" Raditz snarled, fear for his charges feeding
his anger... They'd escaped destruction by a heartbeat, but now the
demon was hunting them.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"HAAAA!" Goku slammed sideways into the demon's ankle, catching it
mid-stride. Though the great ankle was bare of the thick, curly,
cushioning hair, its rubbery hide still flung Goku back--but it did
nothing for the demon's balance. Caught off-balance, one foot knocked
out from under it, the monster staggered, flailed and went down. The
impact of its fall cracked the ground in all directions.
<p>
Cacodemon thrashed as he scrabbled to regain his feet; Piccolo dove
down, striking for the unprotected eyes.
<p>
The great demon's head snapped to one side so fast only Goku could see
the move, and the jaws clashed shut--on Piccolo. Piccolo screamed
harshly as Cacodemon shook his head and flung Piccolo's body
away--minus his left arm and shoulder. The Namek fall heavily to the
ground, blood oozing from the gaping wound; the left half of his chest
had been bitten away. The demon swallowed, and licked his tendriled
lips.
<p>
"PICCOLO!" Gohan shouted, enraged; his hair stood on end as his aura
crackled with its own lightning.  Cacodemon's eyes widened as the
boy's power skyrocketed.
<p>
"KA-"
<p>
"GOHAN! NO!" shouted Goku, but Gohan was too enraged to listen.
<p>
"ME-"
<p>
Piccolo groaned, shuddering as his body began to convulse in the
throes of regeneration.
<p>
"HA-"
<p>
"GOHAN! LISTEN TO ME! YOU CAN'T STOP HIM THAT WAY!" Goku pleaded,
coming between Gohan and the demon.
<p>
Gohan's eyes were blank with rage; he did not hear.
<p>
"-MEHA!" Goku darted back out of the way as Gohan's huge ki ball
flashed downward, right into the great Chaos demon's mocking eyes.
<p>
It detonated right on the blazing red ruby embedded in the demon's
skull-- detonated into a seething ball of red lightning swirling over
the demon's face. Stray lightning strokes lashed out, walking across
the ground and splitting the sky. One stray bolt touched down not far
beyond Bulma's destroyed house.
<p>
Like flipping a switch back on, Raditz and Goten and the others
returned to Goku's awareness. What had happened? He looked over to
where they must be--yes, there they were, flying quickly away. But if
he could sense them.. so could the demon. Goku put two fingers to his
forehead, concentrating on Raditz's ki. He disappeared.
<p>
The lightning storm folded in on itself and vanished into the
sun-bright gem. Cacodemon laughed that clanging-steel laugh. "WHAT
HELPFUL FOOLS YOU ARE!" Then his head snapped around in the other
direction and his eyes narrowed.  "DIE, RADITZ, DIE WITH YOUR SAIYAN
WHELPS!"
<p>
Cacodemon spat white fire at the small group--a great column of the
starkly incredible energies an enraged Gohan had just given him. For a
short moment, a sun touched down on the eastern edge of Satan City;
the white blast lit the night, bringing false dawn to half the
world. Rock cracked, melted and vaporized; a vast fireball spread and
spread, engulfing half the earthquake-battered city. There were no
survivors.
<p>
The great demon watched the billowing mushroom cloud with
satisfaction; he could no longer sense his prey--their lives had
vanished from his ken in the instant of his attack. Only one important
life remained...
<p>
Cacodemon turned his great head, watching the boy who hovered above
him, eyes wide with stark horror.  The demon laughed again. "TIME FOR
YOU TO DIE AND FULFILL THE CURSE!"
<p>

<p>
Chi-chi yawned and glanced at her clock--and opened her eyes fully. It
was seven o'clock! It couldn't be morning already--could it?  She had
barely slept a wink in the nearly empty house, worrying herself sick
about Gohan and Goten and Goku. But.. if it was morning already, why
was it so dark?
<p>
Chi-chi tossed a robe on and stepped outside; it was utterly
dark. Neither stars nor moon shone in the sky, and there was no hint
of coming dawn; not a single light shined from neighboring houses.
<p>
She ran back inside, checking all the clocks in the house. Every one
of them agreed; it was after seven A.M, long past sunrise. Chi-chi
threw herself on her bed, hugging her pillow. Alone, the entire world
in darkness--it was a nightmare; it had to be!
<p>
That was how Goku found her, when he materialized a few feet
away--with Raditz, Bulma, Trunks, Goten, Sinhika, Sean, Khara, and
Nezumi in tow.
<p>
"EEEEEEEEEEEE!!! GOKU, I'M IN MY NIGHTGOWN!"  Chi-chi peeled herself
off the upper back wall of the bedroom and dropped nimbly to the
floor. "WHAT ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE DOING HERE?"  She put her hands on
her hips and glared death at Goku.
<p>
"Oh, good. This isn't Lord Enma's," commented Raditz, surprised.
<p>
Chi-chi's glare switched to Raditz; the look on her face suggested
that she would happily send him there immediately if not sooner.
<p>
"Ah, calm down, Chi-chi!" Goku raised his hands in a concilliatory
gesture. "It was an emergency, and you were the first person I could
think of to jump to!  If I hadn't, they all would have been killed!"
<p>
"IF THEY WERE DEAD, THEY WOULDN'T BE HERE SEEING ME IN MY NIGHTGOWN!"
<p>
Prince Khara reddened. "She is quite correct; this is most improper."
He, Sinhika and Sean retreated quickly from the room.
<p>
Bulma looked at Raditz and the kids. "Guys--out! You too, Goku. I'll
explain things to Chi-chi." Raditz nodded, swept up Trunks and steered
Nezumi out of the room along with him.
<p>
Goten looked up at his enraged mother.  "Mommy? Please don't be mad at
them; they rescued me from the Bad Place. I didn't mean to be naughty,
but the bad dinosaur fooled me, he sounded just like Daddy!"
<p>
"Oh, Goten!" Chi-chi's anger vanished in an eyeblink; she knelt down
and hugged her son. "It's all right, I know it wasn't your fault!" She
looked up at her husband. "You found him! I knew you would." Chi-chi
smiled.
<p>
Goku smiled back, relieved. "Bulma and Trunks, too.  Everyone's okay,
but..." He put two fingers to his forehead. "Gohan needs my help."
<p>
"GOKU! DON'T YOU DA--" Chi-chi broke off as Goku vanished. She turned
to Bulma. "What on earth is going on?"
<p>
Bulma looked sheepish. "It's a long story.. but not as long as the
other one. As soon as you've changed, I guess I can introduce you to
everyone. You see, there's this huge demon who's trying to kill us,
and.."
<p>

<p>
"DAMN THIS!"
<p>
Perhaps it was a singularly inappropriate curse for a damned soul
seeking escape from Hell, but Vegeta had no interest in the
"appropriateness" of his exclamations. He was simply furious.
<p>
On the edge of Dawn, where the Stygian Nile left the Twelve Hours of
Night and the Solar Barge sailed into the sky, his path was
barred. Again.
<p>
No monster blocked him; no god forbade him to pass. He simply could
not fly. Where the Solar Barge flew, Vegeta could not. The rules had
changed again, and there was nothing to break and no one to kill to
make the rules change back. The dead could not follow the Sun into the
realm of the living, and the damned could not follow Ra into the
heavens.
<p>
Mogris looked at the raging Saiyan prince, and smiled a small, queer
smile. Vegeta noticed.
<p>
"WHAT ARE YOU SO AMUSED BY, WOMAN?" He turned on her, power
seething with his rage.
<p>
"If I tell you, you'd probably kill me," she noted dryly. "But, I do
know how to pass this barrier."
<p>
"WHAT?? If you don't tell me, I <i>will</i> kill you!" Vegeta blustered.
<p>
"Then I definitely wouldn't tell you." Mogris tossed her red hair
back. "Your word, <i>Prince</i> Vegeta; I require your word that you will
neither attack me nor abandon me--for I, too, must face Cacodemon."
No dry sarcasm tainted her voice; all was serious.
<p>
"What?? You have nothing to do with my battle!" What is it with these
women? Every single one I've met in the Hells wants to come with me!
<p>
"I have much to do with the Chaos demon, Vegeta! When I became Mogris,
I exchanged one geas for another.  Modgudh's geas to guard the Gioll
Bridge was broken with the Gioll Bridge, and annulled forever when she
became a living, breathing woman again--but Griselda's geas to fight
Chaos wherever it may be found is my geas, now. I know of Cacodemon's
rampage through the Nine Worlds; I am bound to fight him."
<p>
Vegeta folded his arms and frowned at her. "Oh, very well. You have my
word as Prince of the Saiyajin. NOW TELL ME HOW TO GET OUT OF HERE!"
<p>
Mogris nodded, that queer smile on her face again. "Simple enough; I
can still fly here. I'll carry you." A fresh breeze suddenly stirred
Vegeta's wolf-fur cloak, and Mogris drifted into the air.
<p>
Vegeta glared at her coldly. "Someone.. is going to die... Soon."
Vegeta reached up and grabbed the warrior-woman's arm.
<p>
Behind the Mountain called Bakhau, where the Sun ascends from the
Underworld into the dawn sky, the change began. Vegeta felt himself
become lighter, less real--and Mogris became like gossamer in his
grip, something untouchable. He could no longer hold her, nor could
she grasp him, for Mogris was living flesh and Vegeta was a dead soul,
here on the sharp edge of life.
<p>
"No!" The Saiyan Prince knelt on the jagged mountaintop, bracing
himself with his clenched fists. "It cannot end here!"
<p>
"We could go back the way you came, find a ship to take us across the
sea to Niffleheim..." Mogris trailed off at the look on Vegeta's face.
<p>
"NO! That would be too late!" Some instinct told Vegeta that he could
not turn back or turn aside, or all would be lost. So close.. beyond
the Dawn lay life, and Bulma and Trunks and Kakarott... His soul
called out to her, Bulma, the blue-haired goddess of his hidden
heart.
<p>
I.. must.. go.. to.. her.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Bulma started; she'd been daydreaming, right in the middle of the
crowded living room.  Well, at least everyone had been introduced,
sort of, and the kids were finally in bed, again--that was the first
thing she and Chi-chi did. Now what?
<p>
Sean had found a few clean sheets of paper somewhere and was busily
sketching. His black hair hung over his face as he worked intently on
his drawing.
<p>
Bulma grew curious; was he recording something from their recent
adventures?  What was so urgent that he had to start right <i>now</i>,
barely ten minutes after they'd arrived? She padded quietly over and
looked past his shoulder--and gasped. It was another picture of
Vegeta!
<p>
Sean looked up at the sharp intake of breath. At the sight of Bulma,
he blushed, and quickly tried to cover up the picture. "Uh--"
<p>
"No, wait. I want to see..."
<p>
Reluctantly, Sean pulled his hands back. It was still a rough pencil
sketch, but very distinct for all that. Vegeta lay as she had last
seen him, eyes closed and his face peaceful in death. His hands were
clasped over his breast, hiding the dreadful wound inflicted by the
demon, and branches of cherry blossoms were nestled all around his
body. Tears filled Bulma's eyes; this was a picture of his burial;
there, at the top of the picture were the boulders that marked his
grave. All around the edges of the picture were strange glyphs,
writing from some alien language unknown.
<p>
The tears ran freely down Bulma's face. "How did you-- Why did you
draw this?"
<p>
Sean looked troubled. "I'm sorry, I didn't want to hurt you. This
picture came to me--it's been haunting my thoughts ever since I
finished the other painting. I started working on it before.. things
went to hell, but the first draft got lost with my apartment."
<p>
"You have another painting to do?" Sinhika came over from her
conversation with Khara, one eyebrow raised. Then her gaze fell on the
sketch.
<p>
"<i>Achintya! Aadhyaatmikuum Kshatriyaa!</i>" Sinhika snatched the drawing
from Sean's hands, staring at the writing around the edges, her lips
mouthing words no one could follow.
<p>
"What does that mean?" Bulma asked.
<p>
Sinhika handed the drawing back to a startled Sean. "Hold that where I
can see it!" She turned toward her brother "Khara! Look at this!"
Sinhika pointed at the writing on Sean's sketch.
<p>
Prince Khara walked over with short, quick steps. "Ah!" he exclaimed,
and pulled a ivory tube from inside his embroidered jacket. He opened
it, and delicately withdrew an ancient scroll, which he unrolled and
held out for Sinhika.
<p>
"Huh?" said Sean, embarassed to be suddenly getting so much attention.
He looked up at the scroll Sinhika was now displaying.  "They're the
same!" he exclaimed. "What is this?"
<p>
"Yes, it is so. See, along each edge, framing the picture.. the first
four verses of the Mantras of Compassion." He looked at his
sister. "Father said you would know who must say them, and for
whom. This is a sign--it is time for them to be invoked." The unspoken
question hung in the air between them.
<p>
Sinhika looked intently at Bulma. "Forgive me; I did not tell you the
whole truth before. <i>Aadhyaatmikuum Kshatriyaa</i> means 'Ghost Prince';
it is the title we gave Vegeta when he came to Lankha weeks ago
seeking our father, who is Vibishana the Good Demon, King of the
Rakshasas."
<p>
Sinhika gingerly handed the ancient parchment to Bulma. "The Mantras
of Compassion are prayers of healing.. and resurrection. My father
once taught them to Hanuman, to restore Rama's army that was slain
fighting against Ravanna to rescue Sita; now I must teach it to you."
<p>
Bulma's eyes widened, and the blue-haired woman sat down quickly as
her legs suddenly turned to jelly. "But how can I...?"
<p>
"They must be recited over the slain, by one who is compassionate--one
who loves them. You are the one who weeps for the Prince; no other can
call on the gods to do this."
<p>
Bulma looked out the window at the night, up at the mountain behind
Goku's house. She took a deep breath, and let it out slowly. "I will
do it."
<p>

<p>
"YIIII!" Gohan narrowly dodged Cacodemon's breath-blast. The titanic
blast streaked past him to annihilate the hill behind him, sending a
cloud of dust and ash high into the air.
<p>
After his own disasterous attack on the Chaos demon, Gohan learned not
to throw ki blasts at the monster.  "First the Ochimo ghosts, then the
Opawang, and now him! Isn't there anything I can fight anymore??  I
can't even hit him with my hands, I just bounce off!"
<p>
It followed him; after all the screaming about a curse, it hadn't been
hard for Gohan to figure out that the demon was after him,
personally. Fortunately, that meant the demon would follow him out of
the city, away from the innocent people who lived there.
Unfortunately, that meant the demon would follow him and keep trying
to kill him, while Gohan could do nothing but keep ducking and
dodging.
<p>
"I hope Dad gets back soon. Maybe he'll know how to stop this thing."
Gohan tried to reassure himself as he dodged a slashing claw and
deflected another eye-beam attack.
<p>
Something green whipped between Cacodemon's dinosaurian legs; the
demon bellowed and fell, toppled again. Piccolo darted out from under
the falling demon.
<p>
"All power and speed, but no training. Even a first year student
wouldn't let himself be tripped like that." Piccolo commented as he
joined Gohan--then Goku flickered into existance beside them.
<p>
"Hi, guys! I see you got him out of town; good thing. Too many people
were getting hurt." Goku smiled at Gohan, relieved to see his son
unhurt.
<p>
"Dad, how do we stop him? You do have a plan, right?" Gohan looked
worried.
<p>
"Um, I'm working on one." Goku tried to sound confident, but Gohan
saw through his apparent confidence.
<p>
"You don't know how to stop him!" Gohan worried as Cacodemon regained
his feet.
<p>
"We've got to buy time, Gohan--it fell apart last time, it might do it
this time if we push it hard enough.  He's actually weaker than
Perfect Cell was--most of his power was stolen from us. He's just hard
to hurt--but we'll figure out a way to stop him. Besides, he's lost
his follower demons; that weakened him even more," Goku said
reassuringly--but he was wrong, terribly wrong. Cacodemon <i>had</i> been
weakened--months before, when he first separated Deputy from
himself. Since then, he'd picked and chosen the gifts of Chaos, making
himself infinitely stronger.
<p>
"DIE, FOOLS!" Cacodemon leaped into the air and breathed white fire at
Gohan and Goku--Gohan dodged reflexively. Unexpectedly, the chaos
demon's head twitched to one side and twin eye beams lashed out,
narrowly missing Gohan on the other side--again, Gohan dodged. Another
head twitch, and Gohan dodged away from the attack, back in the other
direction. Barrage after barrage followed, in rapid succession,
driving Gohan lower and further back along the same line.
<p>
Piccolo was the first to see what was happening. "GOHAN! NO--HE'S GOT
YOU IN A PATTERN! GET OUT OF HIS REACH, NOW!" He hurtled toward Gohan,
ready for action.
<p>
Goku acted more directly, diving for the monster's vulnerable-looking
wings.
<p>
Three things happened at once--Cacodemon vomited a column of white
fury at Gohan, who dodged--directly into the path of Cacodemon's
deadly tail stinger. Piccolo knocked Gohan aside as the spear-sized
stinger sought the young man's body; Cacodemon snapped his wings back
and together, hard, catching Goku between them.
<p>
"AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!" Piccolo gave a great cry as the stinger plunged
into his abdomen and out his back, impaling him.
<p>
"PICCOLO--AAAAAAHHHHHH!!" Gohan's cry of dismay turned into a scream
of pain as Cacodemon's eye beams sought and found him, burning his
shirt away and blasting him from the sky.
<p>
Goku didn't cry out as wingbones harder than steel I-beams crushed him
between them; the massive blow knocked the breath out of him--all he
could do was gasp once before the wings flicked open and flung him
across the night-dark sky.
<p>
Cacodemon brought his tail tip up to eye level and regarded the
impaled, writhing Namek with disdain for a few moments. "NOT
SAIYAJIN."  A flick of his tail, and Piccolo smashed into the earth,
digging a deep Piccolo-sized crater.
<p>
The demonic Chaos god located the crater containing Gohan, who was
just staggering to his feet, and spat white fire once again, a great
blast of Gohan's own captured energy. Once again, the very rocks
cracked and vaporized as a huge fireball swelled out and retreated,
leaving behind a mushrooming cloud of dust and ash.
<p>
Cacodemon grinned. The curse was fulfilled... No, it was not. The brat
still lived! Cacodemon howled his rage at the night-dark sky and
flapped his wings, coursing toward his prey.
<p>
Battered, burnt, dazed, Gohan staggered to his feet in the midst of a
vast, deep crater. Cacodemon was coming straight for him, and the
young Saiyajin had barely enough strength to stand. He looked up into
mocking crimson eyes, and saw doom.

<H1><A NAME="Con">XXXII. CONVERGENCE POINT</A></H1>
<p>
Gohan looked up as the demon plunged down. If only he had a moment to
catch his breath, to let his strength return! It wasn't all gone, he
was still super-Saiyajin. With what seemed a last effort of his
burning muscles, he flung himself aside as the great talons slashed
down.
<p>
Gohan didn't dodge the eye-beams; the crimson lasers stung like
burning whips, slashing him and flinging him to the ground again. He
started to drag himself to his feet--the beams lashed him again,
slamming down on his face. His back felt like it had been
flayed. Gohan tucked his feet under his body, rolled, and jumped to
his feet in spite of his protesting muscles.
<p>
Another barrage of eye-beams hit Gohan and chewed up the ground all
around him; Gohan went flying, savagely buffeted by the storm of ki
energy.  Cacodemon crouched low over the youth like a huge, winged
Tyrannosaur ready to leap on its prey. Crimson eyes narrowed as
Cacodemon regarded Gohan; black tendrils writhed in waves along its
mouth. The gem in the middle of its forehead still glowed and pulsed
rhythmically.
<p>
Cacodemon began to switch his tail from side to side, like a great
cat; each swing was in time with the pulsing gem. The great crimson
eyes opened wide, and stared at Gohan, great glowing, swirling portals
into hell.
<p>
Looking into those gigantic, terrible eyes, Gohan felt infinitely
small. What could he possibly do against a monster like this? How
could one small boy defeat the embodiment of murder and violence and
evil? Either the stinger would finally slip past his defenses and he'd
be dead before he felt it like Vegeta, or the monster's sheer power
would overwhelm him. He would die, and Dad would die, and then the
demon would go on to kill Mom and Goten and Bulma and everyone he
knew--all because of him. The demon wanted Gohan dead for killing the
Opawang; everything else was secondary.  The fight was hopeless; they
couldn't beat the demon; maybe if he was dead, it would leave them
alone...
<p>
A sullen anger began to heat up Gohan's aching body; something in him
rebelled against the demon's message of despair.  First Nappa, then
later Recoome, Frieza, Garlic, Cell and now this demon--hating him and
hurting him for no other reason than he existed and got in their way!
He was tired of it, and angry, as angry as he'd ever been at anything
before, angry at this horrid monster that wanted him dead.
<p>
"AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!" Gohan screamed with rage and power as raw energy
seethed through his body, spiking his hair out in all directions,
enveloping him in a corona of yellow fire.
<p>
Cacodemon's lethal tail darted forward--and was parried; Gohan
deflected the deadly stinger, once, twice, more times than he could
count as the demon stabbed at him repeatedly. Venom dripped from the
stinger tip, but none of the lethal toxin reached Gohan.
<p>
"ENOUGH!" yelled Gohan; he grabbed the six-foot bone needle in both
hands and twisted, then pulled--
<p>
Cacodemon howled as the young Saiyajin ripped his stinger out. The
great demon staggered back a step, and whipped the wounded end of his
tail out of Gohan's reach. Gohan darted into the air, a streak of
golden flame; a harsh scream of monstrous rage followed Gohan high
into the air.
<p>
Another golden streak joined him. "Son, what happened? You weren't
even trying to defend yourself at first!"  Worry shaded Goku's
voice.
<p>
Gohan shook his head. What had he been thinking? He <i>knew</i> better than
that! He remembered the confidence dad always had in him, and knew his
father was right. "Dad.. don't look in his eyes. He can hypnotize you
or something.. make you think he's unbeatable, and that you should
just give up."
<p>
"Gohan, are you okay?" There was something in Gohan's face that Goku
did not like.
<p>
"I'm--well.. no. I can't tell, now, if I was scared because he's
unbeatable, or because he made me scared and made me think he's
unbeatable. 'Course," Gohan smiled at his father, "if I refuse to be
scared for any reason at all, it doesn't matter, does it?"
<p>
"He's not unbeatable--but he learned a lot about us from our first
fight, and he's got new techniques to keep us from beating him the
same way. So, we have to use something new."
<p>
Something green flashed up at the edge of Gohan's vision; the boy
quickly turned his head. "PICCOLO!" Gohan yelled joyfully. "I thought
you were dead! The demon stung you..."
<p>
Piccolo smiled wryly. "No tree ever died of snakebite, Gohan. A Namek
is less like a Saiyajin than a human is like a tree." The Namek's
smile turned into a snarl, one lip curling up to expose a
fang. "Cacodemon's venom is made to kill Saiyajin very quickly and
very thoroughly; it does not work very well on anything else."
<p>
Below them, the fell demon flapped his massive wings, slowly climbing
towards the small group. Gohan smiled fiercely. "You're right, dad!
There's a way to beat him, and we'll find it!"
<p>
Piccolo shuddered as a spasm of pain crossed his face. "Gohan, I--"
Another spasm shook him.
<p>
"Piccolo! What's wrong? I thought the poison didn't hurt you?" Gohan's
confidence suddenly turned to worry.
<p>
"Not.. poison." Piccolo was shivering violently, as if
cold. "Something wrong.. with arm, shoulder.. where he bit me." Green
flesh was turning dark, swelling, <i>changing</i>. "Gohan.. stay back..."
Piccolo's face twisted with pain; he threw his head back and howled,
falling out of the sky as his strength failed him momentarily.
<p>
"PICCOLO!" Gohan shouted, and dove after him--only to stop abruptly as
Goku grabbed him. "Dad! What are you--"
<p>
"No! Don't follow him!" Goku pulled his son back. "The demon's bite is
bad--remember the monsters that kept you from following Vegeta?"
<p>
"The monsters? But they were just people who were..." Gohan trailed
off, eyes widening with sudden realization. "..who were transformed by
Cacodemon's spit! PICCOLO! NOOOOOOO!"
<p>
As the horrified Gohan watched, branched antlers sprouted from
Piccolo's head, wreathing it, and his flesh turned darker and
leathery. His cape and pants shredded away as razor-sharp bony spikes
emerged from his spine and joints.
<p>
"YES!" thundered Cacodemon. "HE IS MINE!"
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Pain and confusion tore through Piccolo as unnatural changes wracked
his body. His very thoughts were twisted, chaotic--vicious pain
stabbed through his head every time the Namek tried to sort through
his conflicting emotions and swirling thoughts.
<p>
The mind that had been a bastion of cool reason was submerged in a sea
of passions and pain. His very body deformed painfully; somewhere
beyond himself, others waited for him. One was the source of his pain,
Piccolo knew; what were the others? Which was which?  Emotion became
pain; the strongest emotion was the greatest pain--and Piccolo lashed
out at the greatest agony of all.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"YIIIIIII!" Gohan dodged frantically as the transformed Piccolo
charged him, striking with all his power. "PICCOLO! STOP! It's me,
Gohan!"
<p>
Goku took one look at Piccolo's distended, blood-shot eyes and thought
he knew the truth. "Gohan!  Be careful! Piccolo's not himself!
Cacodemon's got control of him somehow!"
<p>
The chaos-twisted Namek turned to Goku, empty eyes peering out from
antler-crowned brow. A spasm of pain passed over his face and he
howled, rushing to attack.
<p>
Goku and Piccolo whirled about each other, a storm of blows, feints
and blocks. Piccolo seemed unable to do other than hammer madly at
Goku, and Goku held back, afraid that he might harm his friend and
Gohan's teacher. Engrossed in the fight, Goku did not hear the sound
of monstrous wings flapping.
<p>
"Dad! Cacodemon's getting away!" Gohan's frantic shout broke through
his concentration.
<p>
"Forgive me, Piccolo." Goku said apologetically, then rammed his fist
deep into the dark Namek's stomach. A follow-up blow slammed into the
back of Piccolo's neck--and Goku yelped, clutching a sliced and bloody
hand.  Those bone spurs were <i>sharp</i>!
<p>
Piccolo plumetted down; Goku looked around. The immense power of
Cacodemon receded as the demon flapped off toward the east--toward his
home. Toward Chi-chi, Goten, Bulma and Raditz, who were helpless
against him.
<p>
"GOHAN! We have to stop him---ARRGGGHH!" Piccolo came from below,
striking savagely upward to gore Goku with his antlers.
<p>

<p>
"What the--?" Vegeta was the first to spot the demon tiger chariot as it
coursed through the air above the rim of Mount Bakhau. "Impossible!
What is <i>he</i> doing here?"
<p>
Mogris squinted, trying to pick out the tiny shape that Vegeta was
watching so intently. "My eyes are not so good as yours; who is
impossible and is he an enemy?"
<p>
"Not so far," growled Vegeta, suddenly guarded. The chariot turned
toward them, and rapidly drew near.
<p>
"So who do you know in a silver-chased chariot, wearing a dark red
cape and silver armor, with dark blue hair?" Mogris asked as she
unlimbered her shield.
<p>
"King Vibishana." And so it proved as the chariot touched down before
Vegeta, and the sapphire-eyed demon king looked down at the dead
Saiyan prince.
<p>
"I should have heeded Khara's judgment as to your return path; I would
have found you sooner," said the Rakshasa King as he dismounted from
the chariot.
<p>
"What are you doing here?" snarled Vegeta.
<p>
"I am here to bring you back to Earth," said the demon Vibishana, "and
there is little time. Come, I will be your charioteer."
<p>
"What??" Vegeta's eyes narrowed as he regarded the demon king
suspiciously. "How did you know I was ready?  And what is wrong with
time?" A coldness gripped him; had he lost track of time?  Had years,
decades, centuries passed while he pursued his quest to the edge of
creation?
<p>
"Cacodemon is loosed upon the Earth--and more powerful than before. I
knew that you would be ready--you would not have come forward in time
otherwise, Prince Vegeta." The Rakshasa King climbed up into the
charioteer's position.
<p>
Prince Vegeta climbed into the enchanted chariot that once belonged to
Prince Indrajit, in the long-ago, and held up his hand when King
Vibishana would have goaded the tigers to fly. "Mogris comes with us."
<p>
Vibishana nodded in acknowledgement as Mogris climbed into the chariot
behind Vegeta. Finally the tigers spread their wings...
<p>

<p>
Halfway up the mountain, Raditz looked sharply to the east. "Something
happened."
<p>
"What?" Prince Khara looked around, suddenly wary; his right hand
rested on the hilt of the great hand-and-half sword at his side.
<p>
"Yes.. what?" Bulma gasped, already out of breath from their climb up
the mountain--or rather, <i>her</i> climb.  Everyone else could fly.
<p>
"Piccolo--his power dropped, and then changed," Raditz said
impassively. "Gohan's taken a beating too, but his power went way up a
little bit ago--kid must have gotten mad." Raditz chuckled.
<p>
"I think," said Sinhika nervously, "we should hurry."
<p>
"Yes, we should," said Raditz as he offered his hand to a struggling
Bulma.
<p>
"You could all fly there, and Raditz could carry me there," she
answered. "Except I'm the only one here who knows exactly where Vegeta
is buried, and I can't fly OR see in the dark!"
<p>
Bulma was wrong about one thing: one other person knew exactly where
his father was buried. Trunks slipped quietly up the mountain path,
following his mother and the others in the dark.
<p>

<p>
WHAAAM! Piccolo slammed into the ground, shaking and cracking it.
<p>
"I'm sorry, Piccolo, but I can't let you hurt my dad! I know you'll
understand when you are yourself again." Gohan raised his arms as the
demonic Namek raised his dark, antler-wreathed face from the earth.
<p>
"MAA-SEN-KO!" Gohan's ki bolt flashed down, striking the warped
Piccolo square in the chest. It exploded in a cloud of fire and
smoke, obscuring everything from view.
<p>
"Gohan! Can you hold Piccolo off for a while?" Goku appeared beside
his son, breathing hard. "I have to stop Cacodemon." Goku's face
turned hard. "He's going after the children again."
<p>
"Yes. I will, Dad." Gohan replied confidently, hiding the pain deep
within.
<p>
"I knew you could." Goku looked carefully at his son. "Piccolo will be
all right."
<p>
"You think so, Dad?" Gohan looked at him, puzzled, but trusting.
<p>
"Yes.  We will set things right, and that includes Piccolo."  Goku
said, and Gohan could see the pain and anger in his father's
eyes. Goku's kindly heart would never accept the pain and death caused
by evil--he would do everything in his power to undo the evil that had
been done.
<p>
"Don't worry, I don't think you could hurt Piccolo without being as
mad as you were at Cell. All you need to do is keep him busy for a
while."
<p>
"Okay, Dad." Gohan nodded at his father. Goku waved back, and vanished
in a flicker-flash of light.
<p>

<p>
Bulma stumbled to a halt in the small meadow, out of breath, tired
and.. overwhelmed. This place always overwhelmed her, the place where
her love lay buried, where she'd said her last goodbyes and wondered
if he could hear them.
<p>
Are you here, Vegeta? she asked silently. Do you know what is
happening? Will you come back to me? She reached up and untied the
ribbon holding her hair back, letting the soft blue cloud of it tumble
down to her shoulders.
<p>
A soft glow suddenly lit the small meadow, revealing the boulders with
the inscription carved into them. Bulma jumped, and looked behind
her--oh. Just Raditz, lighting the night with his own power. The two
rakshasa demons stood close by, slightly ill-at-ease.  At the sight of
them, Bulma felt suddenly uneasy herself. Whether the Mantras worked
or not, whether they invoked powers holy or blasphemous, Bulma knew
she could not do this with two demons looking over the grave of her
prince. They didn't belong here.  Raditz belonged here, at the side of
his prince--but the demons did not.
<p>
Bulma looked at Sinhika and Khara. "You'll have to go. You have taught
me what I need to know, but you cannot be here when I.. waken
Vegeta. I'm sorry, but it just.. isn't right."
<p>
Sinhika opened her mouth to protest, but then Khara laid a gentle hand
on her shoulder. "No, she is right. We do not belong here. We will be
down the path a small way if you should need us."
<p>
"I think.." Bulma hesitated, "it would be better if you went all the
way back to the house. I have a hunch that it would be.. safer."
<p>
Prince Khara bowed briefly to Bulma. "It will be as you say. Come,
Sinhika." The Rakshasa prince rose into the air, followed by Sinhika,
and swooped down the mountain toward the distant lights of the house.
<p>
Raditz picked up a length of fallen wood, ignited it, and stuck it in
the ground as an impromptu torch. "I think," he said impassively, "you
should do what must be done <i>soon</i>." The tall Saiyajin looked toward
the west. "Cacodemon is coming."
<p>
Bulma swallowed hard. "There's just one problem," she said. "The
Mantras are supposed to be recited just before dawn, at the first sign
of light."
<p>
Raditz glanced at the dark, starless sky. "How long until dawn?"
<p>
Bulma shivered. "It should have come hours ago."
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
WHAAM! WHAAM! WHAAM! Goku hammered Cacodemon's skull and jaws with
mountain-shattering blows, causing the demon to wobble in flight.
Each time he struck, Goku had to dodge as the great demon snapped at
him, teeth clashing shut where he had just been. Still the demon flew
on, seemingly untouched, still cushioned by the thick hair and rubbery
hide and power far vaster than any dragon or dinosaur.
<p>
Good thing I can dodge him a lot better than I dodged Vegeta when <i>he</i>
was a giant monster! Goku's eyes narrowed as he studied the
ponderously flying demon.  All of the stolen energy had been absorbed
into that huge gem on the demon's forehead... Goku circled back and
over the demon's head from behind.
<p>
"HAAAAAAIIII-YAAA!" A single perfect blow slammed into the great gem,
driven with all the strength in Goku's body--
<p>
"AAAAAAAGGGGHHHH!" Goku howled as his hand plunged into the blazing
ruby and seemed to fuse with it--and his life poured into the
gem. Brighter than a star the gem blazed, and hot--burning Goku's body
and searing his trapped hand as he collapsed helplessly across the
gem, his power draining away faster than he could move.
<p>
Cacodemon laughed that harsh clashing metal sound. "FOOL! NOW.. DIE!"
The long tail whipped up, the newly regenerated stinger dripping with
venom, arched over Cacodemon's back and plunged down--
<p>
"Go..han.." Goku gasped, as, with the last of his strength, he put two
fingers to his forehead and reached out to his son...
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"KAKAROTT!" Raditz staggered as if he'd been struck, and the
expression on his face was that of a man who has taken his deathwound.
"Goku..." Sweat beaded on his forehead. He turned to Bulma, a snarl of
anger replacing the mortal shock.
<p>
She looked back at him, eyes wide and scared. "What--what happened?"
<p>
"The demon.. killed my brother. I felt his power fade suddenly, then
vanish."  There was an odd flatness to his voice that made Bulma
shiver; it was worse than his grimness when the Opawang attacked them
in the mountains. "Gohan and Piccolo are far away; Cacodemon comes."
<p>
"Son-kun! I.." Bulma gulped as the tears started to drip from her
eyes. She couldn't say anything more--not about Goku. He couldn't be
gone! Not him, too; not again! "We're going to die, aren't we?"
<p>
"NO! Not if I can help it! I'll take you back to the house; the
Rakshasas can hide you and everyone from the monster." Raditz strode
across the tiny meadow and grabbed Bulma by the arm.
<p>
"No, Raditz! They can't hide me--we know that already. The demon will
come after us anyway--it knows where we are, no matter what Sinhika
and Khara do. There's no place to hide." Bulma looked at him,
determined. "I won't run--I refuse to spend the rest of my life
running from that monster while it destroys everyone who gets between
it and me."
<p>
"So you'll just let it kill you? You can't fight it!" Raditz snarled,
his voice thick with anger. The veins on his forehead stood out.
<p>
"I can't--but you can. Son-kun..." Bulma choked back a sob. "If you
and Goku and Gohan can't stop the thing.. who can? It doesn't matter
if I stay up here, by Vegeta, or hide in the house--it'll be the same
in the end. Either you will all beat the thing, or we.. will all die."
Bulma wiped away more tears.
<p>
Raditz released her arm and stepped back to stare at this perpetually
surprising woman. "Damn this! I can't argue with you, woman."  His
lips curved up in that sly smile Bulma had gotten to know well. "Damn
my stupidity for meeting you first--and then getting killed.  I hope
Vegeta knows how lucky he is!"
<p>
The big, long-haired Saiyajin looked out into the night, toward the
unseen threat of Cacodemon. "We don't have very long; I'll do what I
can to hold him off--and that's more than you might think!" Raditz
smirked again. "You do what you think best..." he trailed off, brows
furrowing with worry.
<p>
Bulma bit hard on her trembling lip. "What's the matter?"
<p>
"I can't leave you alone and unprotected up here! But if I wait to
fight until he gets here.. the demon will be able to kill you too
easily." His head turned from her toward the distant demon and back.
<p>
"Mother will not be alone, Raditz-san." Trunks stepped out of the
shadows.
<p>
Raditz started and blinked, then smiled wryly. "Good--no, <i>excellent</i>
job hiding your ki, young prince."
<p>
"TRUNKS!" Bulma shrieked. "You're supposed to be safe in bed!"
<p>
"I'm sorry, mother, but I have to be here--to help bring back father."
The young boy's eyes were very wide, and his face was solemn.
<p>
"Young man, you will go right back to the house. RADITZ! Take Trunks
and--"
<p>
"No." Raditz smiled knowingly at Trunks and folded his arms; he
understood. "The <i>young prince</i> has as much right to be here as you
do."
<p>
"What? Raditz, he's only a five-year-old boy! It's much too
dangerous!"
<p>
"He is a Saiyan warrior and a prince, no matter what his age. Do you
think he wants his father back any less than you do? Do you think he
would do any less than you to get Vegeta back? Do honor and duty weigh
any the less because he is young?  Rather, he feels the burden more
keenly, because he has so little power to abide by its demands.
Respect the duty he has to <i>his father</i>!" The big Saiyajin spoke
calmly, yet with unusual sternness.
<p>
Bulma looked into her son's eyes. "He is his father's son," she
agreed.
<p>

<p>
Far above the Earth, the great black cloud that coiled around the
planet began to break up.  Released from the serpentine coils that had
held it suspended for a time, the world turned again; as the banks of
unnatural cloud broke up, the stars began to peek through the night
side once again. Long-delayed dawn began to seep across the sky around
the world.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz plunged through the air toward the distant but rapidly nearing
demon. As he gathered ki in one hand, he tried not to think that he
would probably die, his death accomplishing nothing save to help the
demon fulfill the Opawang's death curse. It didn't help, trying to
avoid thinking, but the dark thoughts were drowned out in the rising
exhilaration of impending battle--a battle he would fight with <i>all</i>
his powers.
<p>
The demon was near enough, now.  Raditz flung the sphere of energy
high into the sky, where it exploded into a glowing ball of silvery
lunar light. With <i>all</i> my powers, he thought as the energy of
transformation started to pulse through him.
<p>
With a roar like thunder, a great, maned ouzaru in white armor leaped
into the air and grappled Cacodemon, dragging the surprised monster
from the air. A huge ape-like hand darted out and seized the demon's
deadly tail, wringing the venom-dripping stinger until it snapped
off. Another hairy arm held the Chaos demon in a head lock, keeping
the monster's snarling jaws immobile and out of reach.
<p>
Cacodemon gurgled with rage through his clenched teeth and raked the
maned ouzaru's arm with its acid-slimed claws. Wings flapped wildly,
half-blinding the maned ouzaru as it pinned the monstrous demon to the
earth, grinding its left knee into the demon's back.
<p>
The great ape bit deep into the demon's left shoulder and spat out a
gobbet of blubbery hide--only to see the wound boil as the torn flesh
regenerated faster than the blood could pour out of it. The maned
ouzaru growled, and tightened his grip on the demon's tail; the new
stinger was already protruding from the rapidly healing
appendage. Tearing it off again wouldn't help.
<p>
The maned ouzaru growled and bit the demon again; with one swift
thrust, he jammed the tail stinger deep into the wound, and hammered
it with all his strength, his fist driving it into the demon's back
like a nail.
<p>
Cacodemon squealed thinly through his trapped jaws and stopped clawing
madly at the imprisoning arm.  Slowly and deliberately the huge demon
grabbed the ouzaru's arm at the wrist and with tremendous effort,
pulled the arm away from his throat, the gem on his head pulsing with
a blinding light. Though smaller than the great ouzaru, Cacodemon was
far, far stronger, and ripe with Goku's stolen power.
<p>
Far above, a few stars peered through the thinning haze of star dust,
and the sky began to lighten in the east.
<p>

<p>
"DAD! Eat this, it's a senzu bean!" Barely conscious, Goku obediently
swallowed the small object someone was shoving in his mouth. He
snapped wide-awake as strength and warmth flooded back into him;
wounds closed and burnt skin flaked away, replaced by new.
<p>
"Gohan! I made it!" Goku exclaimed, smiling at his son as he flexed
his newly-healed hand. "I wasn't sure I had enough strength left..."
He looked around; he was stretched out on the ground, high up on a
forested hill. He frowned; he could sense the demon--and <i>something</i>
that felt like Raditz grown stronger and wilder. Something
missing.. "Where's Piccolo?"
<p>
"Umm.. unconscious, I think." Gohan was reluctant to continue. "I need
a senzu for him.. he's in pain, and his thoughts are so confused,
that's why he attacked us. I don't think Cacodemon is actually
controlling him."
<p>
"Are you sure?" Goku asked as he rose to his feet and adjusted his gi.
<p>
"Pretty sure." Gohan nodded.
<p>
Goku reached into his pouch and handed Gohan three senzu beans. "Here,
you may need some, too. It's getting rough."
<p>
"Thanks, Dad!" Gohan smiled and darted into the air, and stopped,
hovering.
<p>
"Gohan-- don't hit the demon's gem. That's how I got hurt--it sucks
energy out of you if you touch it."
<p>
Gohan nodded. "The Opawang could do that, too."
<p>
"Once you've taken care of Piccolo, I need your help against the
demon. Raditz is the only one fighting it now, and it's a lot closer
to home." Goku's face turned stern as he looked toward the distant
demon.
<p>
"Raditz?? But he's not strong enough--oh." Gohan suddenly realized the
significance of the glowing orb in the sky. "I forgot, he still has
his tail!"
<p>
"Hurry, Gohan; he's still not strong enough."
<p>

Long, razor-sharp claws sank into the maned ouzaru's arm and heaved;
the great demon flexed its whole body and flung the ouzaru headlong.
<p>
WHOOOMMM! Cacodemon spat a great gout of raw power at the maned
ouzaru; it struck the great ape as he struggled to rise. The white
blast struck and exploded with hellish fury; the fireball boiled up
and up into the atmosphere, finally collapsing in an immense cloud of
smoke and ash that rose to the lowermost reaches of the upper
atmosphere, and drifted on the upper winds, coloring sunsets for weeks
afterwards.
<p>
For good measure, the great Chaos demon blasted blindly with his eye
beams through the smoke, toward the focal point of his attack. After
some minutes of this, he stopped, snarling.
<p>
Then Goku appeared out of nowhere, and punched Cacodemon in the
nose. The demon reared back, startled at the sudden attack, snarled,
and snapped at Goku, who dodged easily-- and then suddenly back again
as the tail stabbed at him from the other direction.
<p>
"WHOA!" Goku dodged the lethal stinger as well--and then the eyebeams
hit him and sent him careening into the side of a mountain.  "Oh, no!
He's all powered up with MY power!" Goku dodged frantically as
Cacodemon spat white fire at him, annihilating the mountain he'd just
hit. Goku vanished in the fireball as it swelled to envelope him.
<p>
"LEAVE MY DAD ALONE, YOU BIG BULLY!" Gohan slammed hard into
Cacodemon's ankle, and the demon came crashing down; Cacodemon's
balance was as bad as ever. As the demon thrashed, Gohan lifted a
shattered chunk of mountain with his mind and hurled it down on the
demon.
<p>
The angry demon looked up, and disintegrated it with a flash of his
crimson eyes. With a snap of his wings, the demon catapulted himself
into the air, and crimson beams darted past Gohan's head like
bullets. Gohan didn't dodge--the demon's attack was astray--and that
saved him, as a bolt of white fire boomed past through the space where
he would have dodged to.
<p>
"Whew!" Gohan ignored the miss, which parted the very air and slashed
deep into space, striking the moon's dark face. The hidden orb
exploded, sending chunks of rock and gravel into a myriad of
orbits--some to deep space, some to plunge into the atmosphere as an
unexpected meteor shower, and the rest to orbit Earth as an eternal
hazard to space travel. Thus did Earth acquire its first ring.
<p>
Another barrage of eye-beams chased Gohan, who dodged them
confidently--he'd seen this pattern before. Next comes the tail, he
thought, preparing to dodge the stinger again.
<p>
CLONK! A sudden strike of the demon's clawed hand sent Gohan reeling
as he caught part of the unexpected blow. Don't get cocky, he thought
muzzily as he started to right himself--
<p>
WHOOOMMM! Another great blast of white fire, this time enveloping
Gohan. Another mountain vanished in the fireball and surging smoke
cloud. Cacodemon followed through with a few desultory eye-beams, and
then waited for the smoke to settle. The whelp's power had dropped
dramatically; he was probably unconscious.  The great demon grinned,
and flexed his venomous tail, readying it to strike. Cacodemon licked
his teeth with a pointed black tongue; the other Saiyajin of the curse
was also unconscious, and only needed a touch of his tail.. and that
smoke cloud was almost clear. He raised his wings, ready to snap them
down and launch himself into the air--
<p>
Goku appeared. His chest heaved and his breath came in great gasps,
his gi was almost burned away. Blood trickled from the corner of his
mouth. He stood between Cacodemon and his prey, and smirked. "You
can't beat me that easily!"
<p>
Cacodemon studied Goku for long minutes as the smoke cloud cleared.
"YOU CANNOT ESCAPE ME AND SAVE THE CHILD BOTH. ONE OF YOU WILL DIE!"
Cacodemon spat white fire at the crater now visible beneath the
clearing smoke.
<p>
A flicker-flash, and Goku vanished, only to appear between the
oncoming attack and Gohan.  He threw both hands up, blocking the
attack, blocking his own titanic power thrown at him. Back and back he
was forced, unti he stood in the crater beside a battered, unconscious
Gohan, holding off the tremendous beam. Goku's arms ached and burned
from the effort; sweat poured off his entire body, and his entire will
was concentrated into one point--a point under unbearable
pressure. His aura brightened, and wild yellow sparks cracked and flew
about it.
<p>
"AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!" Goku screamed as he made one final effort--and
deflected the terrible beam away from his son, up into the air, where
it plunged on into deep space to explode far beyond sight or sound. He
collapsed to his knees beside Gohan, every muscle shaking.
<p>
The demon snapped his wings down and half-lept, half-flew to the
crater where the two Saiyajin lay. Before Cacodemon could do more than
snarl and start to bring his tail up, both Goku and Gohan flickered
and vanished.  Cacodemon howled his rage until the very rocks cracked
and broke.
<p>
Great wings flapped as Cacodemon descended on the other crater where a
great maned ape sprawled unconscious, bleeding and burned. The Chaos
demon flexed his tail and lashed out, the deadly stinger plunging down
toward the helpless ouzaru--
<p>
"GREAT PARRY!" A woman's voice rang out, and Cacodemon's stinger
glanced off a rune-painted shield.  The holder of the shield appeared
out of nowhere, between Cacodemon and his prey; a small, auburn-haired
woman clad in maroon and blue armor. In her left hand, the great round
shield painted with the runes of Death and Earth fended off the Chaos
demon's stinger; in her right hand she held a long spear, graven with
the runes of Air and Fire, ready to throw.
<p>
"AN ORLANTHI? HERE?" Cacodemon reared back; for the first time since
he came forward from Before Time, the Chaos demon's confidence was
shaken. A little. A very, very little. "DIE, WINDPRIESTESS!" He
vomited white fire at the woman--
<p>
Impossibly, her shield deflected it, deflected an attack that would
have staggered Goku at the height of his power.  Half the world away,
a mountain range exploded into dust and vapor.  High above, the sphere
of lunar light burst at the touch of a black steel arrow and faded
away.
<p>
"Have you forgotten the Shield of Arran, Cacodemon? The Earth itself
is my shield, foul slime of Chaos!" She raised the spear. "LIGHTNING
SPEAR!" The lightning bolt flashed from her hand to Cacodemon--
<p>
The lightning bolt struck square on the blazing jewel in his forehead,
struck and sunk into its depths without a trace. Cacodemon
grinned. Mogris looked at her empty right hand. The Lightning Spear
was gone.
<p>
"ORLANTH IS DEAD, HE HAS NO POWER HERE, FOOLISH WINDWHORE!" Cacodemon
laughed harshly. "NOW MY LAST ENEMIES DIE!" He turned his head toward
the fallen ouzaru--and stopped. The great maned ape was gone. Nothing
but an empty crater lay before him.
<p>

<p>
The first light of dawn peeked above the horizon as Bulma spoke the
words. All her sorrow and loss and love for her fallen prince went
into that prayer, and the world wept with her, and the very heavens
asked, What can we do to help her?
<p>
And the Preserver answered.
<p>
Half the mountain exploded beneath Bulma's feet. Power burst from the
mountain as the sun touched it, power that shivered stone and sent it
flying miles into the air. By some miracle, none of the boulders fell
on the Son house nestled below the mountain. A familiar power
protected Bulma and Trunks from the consuming fury that would have
burned the flesh from their bones and vaporized the bones. Bulma felt
herself and Trunks cradled in a sphere of cool power as the dust
settled and the smoke cleared.
<p>
"Silly woman--I told you I'd be back!" Vegeta said.

<CENTER><P>CONTINUED IN CHAPTER XXXIII. COUNTERCHAOS</P></CENTER>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Counter">XXXIII. COUNTERCHAOS</A></H1>
<p>
"Silly woman--I told you I'd be back!"
<p>
Bulma stared, open-mouthed with astonishment, trembling with
joy. Vegeta--her Vegeta!--was here, right in front of her! He
looked.. good; very, very good. He smirked in his usual way, looking
at Bulma, but there was something different in his eyes as his glance
jumped from Bulma to Trunks and back to Bulma again. His dark eyes
glittered in anticipation, and his compact, muscular body radiated a
poise, a confidence that Bulma had not seen in him since before the
fight with Cell. Seeing him like this, she suddenly realized how much
spirit he'd lost when Goku died... a light in him had been dimmed,
nearly put out; now it was rekindled, more brilliant than ever.
<p>
He still wore the Saiyan-style armor Bulma had made for him back then,
the armor he'd thrown on as he hastened to rescue them from
Cacodemon's first attack--and it still showed evidence of the terrible
end of that battle: a fist-sized hole punched through it, front and
back. But covering that, something new--a splendid cloak of shimmering
white fur, so brilliant white it dazzled Bulma as the morning sun
glittered off of it. Bulma's gaze darted to another new thing--the
furry <i>white</i> tail wrapped around Vegeta's waist.
<p>
"Vegeta! You-- your-- your tail!" Bulma stammered, unable to say
anything coherent in the rush of emotions sweeping her. She felt
light-headed, as if she might jump a mile into the air and start
flying at any moment.
<p>
Trunks just stared at his father, silent and wide-eyed. "Papa?"
<p>
Bulma started at that; Trunks had always been so formal whenever he
talked about his father in the last few months. A smile crept across
Vegeta's face for a brief moment that hung in the air...
<p>
And vanished in a scowl. "Stupid woman, what were you thinking to come
up here with my son? Always rushing into things without thinking; you
did not need to be here! It certainly does not matter to me--I have
more important things to worry about!"  A light breeze blew over the
shattered mountain, ruffling Vegeta's crest of upswept black hair as
he folded his arms, still scowling.
<p>
Bulma smiled knowingly; she understood Vegeta-ese better than
anyone--although sometimes she suspected that Goku understood the
prickly prince just as well as she did. The familiar abrasiveness
steadied her, helped her pull coherence out of the maelstrom of
emotion.
<p>
"Of course not! What are these <i>important</i> things you have to worry
about, my prince?" she asked mockingly. "And what are you doing with a
<i>tail</i>?"
<p>
Trunks, looking on, blushed and smiled, hiding his smile beneath his
hand. He understood Vegeta-ese fairly well, too--though the subtler
points escaped him.
<p>
Vegeta looked off into the distance, in the direction Raditz had
flown, and then back at Bulma. "I have a demon to kill, since Kakarott
botched the job, like he botched killing Frieza." He uncurled his
white furry tail, revealing the black tip, switched it from side to
side, and curled it around his waist again. He smirked. "So I kept
this, too. Interesting."
<p>
"Too?" Bulma asked with a tilt of her eyebrows.
<p>
As if in answer, Vegeta lifted the exquisite white fur from his
shoulders and wrapped it around Bulma, then picked her up. He reached
for Trunks, to carry him, but Trunks shook his head and rose into the
air beside his father.
<p>
"I can fly now, Papa! Goku-san and Raditz-san taught me how!" Trunks
stated proudly.
<p>
Vegeta stared at his son in surprise; at Goku's name, Bulma felt his
muscles quiver slightly, then relax. "Raditz, too? Not only is he
alive, he's been doing something useful!" Vegeta laughed.
<p>
"He saved my <i>life</i>, Vegeta! Several times." Bulma snapped, not
amused with Vegeta's contempt toward the long-haired Saiyajin. "And
Trunks, too."
<p>
"Did he?" Vegeta was suddenly thoughtful. "I chose better than I
knew." They were high in the air now, and Vegeta suddenly stooped on
the Son house, far below.
<p>
"You will wait here," he said as they dropped lightly onto the
lawn. Vegeta glanced at his son. "You can fly; can you fight?"
<p>
"Yes, papa. Goku-san and Raditz-san--"
<p>
"--taught you how. Yes, I know!" Vegeta snapped, brows lowering.
<p>
Trunks glared back at his father. "Goku-san and Raditz-san kept up my
training; <i>you</i> taught me first." The inaudible "So there!" was plain
in his eyes.
<p>
Vegeta smirked. "Good. Protect your mother until I get back." With
that, he surged into the air, rocketing toward the cesspit presence of
Cacodemon, hair flashing golden as he flew.
<p>
"Hey! Wait! You can't just--" Bulma protested--but he was already gone.
<p>

<p>
Gohan's entire body was on fire with pain; it felt like his skin had
been burned off and every bone broken and the broken ends twisted and
pulled. He retreated back into unconsciousness.
<p>
Someone shook him awake, stirring all the broken things. Gohan would
have screamed, but he was too weak. Someone's finger was in his mouth,
pushing something between his teeth.
<p>
"Come on, Gohan, just bite down! It's a senzu bean," said Goku from
far away.  But Dad is dead--Cell killed him! Am I dying? No, wait--
Dad is back, because--
<p>
Gohan bit down on the senzu bean as memories of the last few months
suddenly returned.  He finally remembered the fight with Cacodemon,
and the blast of white fire--and nothing more. Gohan opened his eyes;
Dad was holding him, looking worried--worry that changed into a smile
as Gohan sat up.
<p>
"That's better. You had me worried; Cacodemon hit you very hard." Goku
didn't look very good himself; his shirt had been burned away, and the
rest of his gi was torn and tattered; dried blood ran down his face
and across his chest. For all that, turquoise eyes and golden hair
still burned with the fury of battle.
<p>
Gohan looked down at himself; his Piccolo-style tunic was almost as
tattered as his father's gi, and the white cape had been burned
completely away. He flexed his hands and looked up at his father; his
own hair flashed golden.
<p>
"What do we do now?" What <i>could</i> they do, against that monster?
<p>
"We go back and keep fighting him," Goku said grimly. "He's still
trying to find your little brother and Bulma and Trunks."
<p>
"Dad.. What happened to Raditz? Is he.. Did Cacodemon..?"
<p>
Goku frowned. "I don't know. His power dropped so low I could barely
sense it.." Goku started, and looked north from the mountaintop they
were resting on. His jaw dropped. "Vegeta!"
<p>
"What??" Gohan jumped up and looked north--nothing.
<p>
Goku frowned and shook his head. "I thought I felt Vegeta for just a
moment--but he's not there. Just wishful thinking, I guess, or..."
<p>
"Or what, Dad?"
<p>
"Or we better slow that demon down--someone's about to get hurt!"
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz also woke to pain, the pain of seared flesh and cracked
ribs. The pain comforted him; it meant he was still alive. But where
was he? From the feel of things, he was back to his normal form, no
longer ouzaru. What had happened?
<p>
He opened his eyes a crack. The green-needled branches of pine trees
waved over his head in the early morning light. Up on a mountain,
then; he could feel the rocks under his back.  The big warrior
carefully turned his head--and groaned, as the slight movement
tormented a broken collarbone and cracked vertebrae.
<p>
Not such a good idea. Don't move that arm. What else was broken? With
the one good arm, he reached over and checked what he could reach for
injury, then uncurled his tail and used it.
<p>
Tears of pain were leaking from his eyes by the time he was
done. Multiple cracked and bruised ribs, broken collarbone, injured
neck, concussion, possible cracked hip, wrenched knee, broken tibia,
possible cracked femur, unknown internal injuries, bruised tail... In
short, he was out of the fight.
<p>
Raditz was alone, but someone had left him here--placed something
padded under his head, and laid a red velvet cloak over his injured
body...
<p>
He listened and sensed; he was alone, but he could feel another
familiar ki some distance away--his brother still lived!  Thus
comforted, Raditz let himself sink back into unconsciousness.
<p>

<p>
Mogris's arms burned with weariness as she lifted her shield yet
again. Better than what they'd be burning with if she <i>didn't</i> keep
parrying Cacodemon, she thought grimly. I can't keep this up forever,
and the bastard managed to disarm me. Time to think of something new.
<p>
Cacodemon evidently agreed; the great demon stopped to stare at the
infuriating woman. His great tail switched from one side to the other,
in time with the pulsing gem on his forehead. Mogris looked back at
the Chaos demon--and was caught.
<p>
The great crimson eyes caught and ensnared her; it was hopeless. She
could not win; her weapon, the priceless Lightning Spear was gone,
devoured by Chaos. Even the mightiest warriors of this world had
fallen before Cacodemon; what could one lone unarmed Orlanthi hope to
accomplish?  She could only hope for a quick death before the demon's
power.. better that than to survive his victory.
<p>
Cacodemon grinned. "DIE, BITCH OF ORLANTH!" Crimson eye beams slashed
down--
<p>
Only to be deflected yet again by the Shield of Arran. Her arms felt
like lead, and Mogris's heart was a hollow shell, but fifteen hundred
years of experience drove her reflexes--beaten down by despair,
weakened, exhausted, she was still a Hero of Orlanth--and the
fifteen-hundred-year-old warrior guardian of the Gioll Bridge. A snarl
of defiance crossed her face.
<p>
"<i>Foul slime, curse of existance, begone!</i>" began the ancient
challenge of Orlanth.
<p>
Cacodemon howled; he hated the old Storm gods more than anything else
in the Time Before! He spat white fire at her once again; again the
titanic blast was parried, and a remote island exploded with
cataclysmic violence.
<p>
"<i>Turn your back and Flee from Me,</i>"
<p>
Cacodemon leaped forward and snapped at her, gnashing his teeth; she
dodged him, flitting aside and up with ease. The Shield flipped up to parry
his tail stinger, and tilted forward to deflect the barrage of
eyebeams.
<p>
"<i>I will kill you, you are evil,</i>"
<p>
The great Chaos demon squinted up at her as she rose above him. "BLOCK
THIS, THEN--AND LET EARTH BE DESTROYED TO SHIELD YOU!" Cacodemon spat
an immense gout of white fire--a blast of power as great as the one
he'd vomited at Gohan, a column of starkly incomprehensible power that
would shatter the planet it touched.
<p>
It seethed upward toward Mogris, a power that would consume her like a
dead leaf in a volcano's heart; if she blocked it with the Shield of
Arran, the Earth would take the blow--and be destroyed. She dodged; it
arched over to follow her. Mogris flew up with all her speed; the beam
followed, gaining rapidly. She looked down, grimly calculating; just
as the beam reached her, she vanished.
<p>
"TO HELL WITH YOU, WINDWHORE!" Cacodemon laughed triumphantly as his
titanic beam plunged deep into space and exploded. He spread his
wings and flew rapidly toward the river valley where the Son house
nestled.
<p>
Then Goku appeared and punched Cacodemon in the nose.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Mogris looked down at the unconscious figure of Raditz. "Still
breathing, I see--as am I. Next time, Mogris, don't cut it quite so
close!" She admonished herself. "The damn demon's reflexes are faster
than mine--next time, he might hit me <i>before</i> I teleport away!"
<p>
She knelt beside the wounded Saiyajin and gently examined his
wounds. "Vegeta said you were one of his people; he wanted you
alive. Huh. I never would have guessed a guy like you to be a
moon-cursed giant were-ape!" She gently prodded the broken collarbone;
Raditz groaned but did not regain consciousness.
<p>
"White Lady, grant me your power to heal!"  So saying, Mogris laid her
right hand lightly on Raditz's chest; a white glow spread from her
hand to envelope Raditz's body, and then slowly faded, sinking into
Raditz's body. Raditz's breathing immediately changed, becoming less
pained; his eyelids flickered-- and Mogris disappeared.
<p>
Raditz opened his eyes; was there someone there? He looked around,
cautiously, remembering his injuries--no one. He was alone. Then he
realized that he felt no pain, save for the rough stones digging into
the backs of his thighs. He cautiously reached over and checked
himself, poking and prodding more vigorously as nothing hurt.
<p>
"What the hell?? I've been.. healed somehow." Raditz sat up, and
looked himself over. Under the red cloak, he was wearing his white
body armor--and <i>nothing</i> else. The dark bodysuit had not survived his
transformation. "I guess Bulma still needs to work on that version of
the material," he muttered to himself.  "Damn, this is going to
chafe."
<p>
The impromptu pillow under his head turned out to be someone's padded
red velvet vest; Raditz took his armor off and put the vest on. He
picked up the red velvet cloak and admired it briefly before tearing
it in half and setting to work.
<p>
There. Raditz pulled the white armor shell back on. At least I won't
violate Bulma's "public decency laws"--and it won't chafe, either. He
tossed the shortened red cloak over his shoulder. I must look like
something out of one of Gohan's history books, he thought as he looked
down at the impromptu red velvet kilt and padded vest covered by the
white armor.
<p>
"Now what?" he asked as the sky lit up like fire, and the earth shook
under not-so-distant explosions.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Cacodemon bellowed angrily and spat another tremendous beam of power,
this time at Goku. Let the Saiyajin block it if he could; if not, the
planet would be destroyed.  Cacodemon liked the possibilities in this
trick--and Goku had given him so much energy to play with.
<p>
The great crimson eyes widened as Goku responded with his own beam,
the Kamehameha wave, balancing and blocking the terrible blast. The
two beams splashed off of each other until Cacodemon, greedy for
power, let his own beam collapse and Goku's Kamehameha slam down upon
him--only to have it vanish as Goku turned it aside and sent the
energy off into space.
<p>
Goku smirked at the great Chaos demon. "I told you you can't beat me
that easily."
<p>
"<i>Lie and whimper before me!</i>" Mogris's voice answered from behind the
Chaos demon. Orlanth's challenge had been made.
<p>
Cacodemon screamed with rage. An Orlanthi--of course she could
teleport! Cursed Motion Rune.. "FOOLISH CREATURE! NOW I MUST END YOUR
DELUSION OF YOUR DEAD GOD AND YOUR EXISTANCE!"
<p>
"You're a damned Chaos GOD, Cacodemon--and you haven't managed to kill
one lone warrior woman YET!" Mogris taunted. "Crap, I've been kicked
around by BROO who fought better than YOU!"
<p>
Cacodemon grinned, and half-spread his wings. "WHEN I CAME FORWARD IN
TIME, I BROUGHT WITH ME THE POWERS OF THED, GODDESS OF THE BROO AS
WELL AS MY OWN! DOOMCRACK!"
<p>
Something invisible lashed out and smashed into the Shield of Arran;
Mogris tried to parry it--and realized too late that the attack was
directed at the <i>shield</i>, not herself.  With a horrid KRACK!, the
Shield of Arran split in two pieces, and fell from her arm; the former
guardian of the Gioll Bridge stood defenseless.
<p>
"Oh, crap." She vanished; the deadly eyebeams ripped through the air
she'd occupied an instant before.
<p>
Cacodemon spun around, looking for her; he knew the Orlanthi could
only teleport to a place she could see. His great head turned this way
and that; where was she?  Did she know Invisibility?  It was too
bright for the Sandals of Darkness to hide her..
<p>
Something slashed at the corded tendons of his neck, and Goku punched
him in the nose again.  No matter; his bruised nose healed in seconds,
and whatever was attacking his neck was not strong enough to cut
through his hide faster than it healed.
<p>
The great demon coughed a fireball at Goku, and swung his head rapidly
from one side to the other, trying to see whatever was hacking at his
neck. Whatever it was, it was clinging to the back of his head; he
couldn't reach it!
<p>
Goku skidded to a halt two miles away; he finally managed to deflect
Cacodemon's fireball into the air where it exploded. He stared at the
trench his heels and the fireball had dug through meadow and woods for
those two miles, panting with exertion.
<p>
About that time, Cacodemon flung himself on his back; if he couldn't
reach the insect on his neck, he'd crush it to a pulp! The Chaos demon
arched his back and slammed his head into the mountain, shaking the
earth for miles around. He rose, shaking his huge dog-like head,
snarling.
<p>
"Dad, what is he doing?"  Gohan asked as Cacodemon finished rolling
around on the rocks like a giant dog.
<p>
"Trying to knock loose a pest," Goku said. "That strange woman who
challenged him was on his back." He squinted, looking high above. "I
don't see her, but she got away--I think she can teleport. I wonder
where she learned that technique?"
<p>
Goku's eyes suddenly widened; he looked north abruptly. "It <i>is</i>
Vegeta!"
<p>
Gohan jumped up and looked north. "Huh? I still can't feel him!"
Almost as he said the words, he could see the golden blaze of another
Super-Saiyajin's aura. It was Vegeta.
<p>
Vegeta swerved from his course toward them, alighting in front of
them, a look of barely-contained fury on his face. "KAKAROTT! How did
that monster get so powerful??"
<p>
"Vegeta!" Goku stared at the short, powerful figure of the Saiyan
prince. A fierce grin crossed his face. "Welcome back! Hey, you've got
your tail!" Vegeta frowned, and curled his tail up tighter.
<p>
The grin disappeared as Goku looked slightly sheepish. "I'm sorry,
it's my fault he's so powerful. He absorbs power used against him, and
he managed to steal almost all my power and a lot of Gohan's." Goku's
face brightened. "But you've come back--that means you know how to
kill him, right?"
<p>
Vegeta's lips turned up in a cruel smirk. "So the great Kakarott has
been waiting for me to rescue him?" The smirk turned into an evil
grin; Vegeta's eyes danced with barely suppressed laughter. "You
screwed up, Kakarott, and you need me to save the day!"
<p>
Goku blinked, then grinned. "Yep."
<p>
Vegeta threw back his head and laughed, loud and long before answering
Goku's question.  "It won't be that easy, Kakarott.  He's too
powerful." The words fell like a death-knell on Gohan's ears--but then
Vegeta smirked. "You'll just have to get him to expend all that energy
he stole, first. That should be easy for you, Kakarott--just let him
beat on you and don't fire back!" Vegeta laughed wickedly.
<p>
"The stupid demon has no concept of saving his power! That might
change when he weakens, but until then, just keep him busy--and don't
let him destroy the planet!" Vegeta rose into the air, ki gathering in
one hand.
<p>
"Vegeta!" The Saiyan prince looked down at Goku's abrupt call. Goku
held out two senzu beans; Vegeta swooped down to take them. "Gohan has
one left, and I have two more--that's it. Oh, and watch out for
Piccolo--he's.. changed."
<p>
Vegeta tucked them into the wolf-fur pouch at his waist. "Watch
carefully, Kakarott! I'm about to show you something you can never
do!" He hurled the ball of ki high into the sky, where it exploded
into familiar glowing ball of lunar light--and Vegeta transformed.
<p>
The damaged armor he had worn in the Cell Games finally shattered;
unlike his original Saiyan armor, or Raditz's new armor, Bulma's first
attempt at re-creating Saiyan armor could not expand the
several-hundredfold times necessary for an ouzaru.  Soon a great
Saiyan ape with an upswept crest crouched on the mountain and roared
its challenge to the great Chaos demon--a challenge that was taken up
and echoed by another great ape that rose from the nearby mountains, a
maned ouzaru wearing white armor.
<p>
Cacodemon's crimson eyes narrowed; what was this? The weaker, maned
ouzaru was one of the cursed Saiyajin--Raditz--he could feel the
pathetically weak Saiyajin's life force; but who was the other,
monstrously strong ape?  He could not sense its life force! Not one of
the cursed, or he would know it.  The other cursed Saiyajin, the boy
was.. there! Near him, the hero Son Goku. Somewhere over these
mountains he would find the rest of the cursed, the weaklings that he
would delight in obliterating once these heroes were dead.
<p>
Destroy the weak. Cacodemon turned his head towards the nearest
ouzaru--the much weaker, maned one, and spat white fire.
<p>
The great maned ape dodged the deadly blast with surprising speed--but not
the crimson eye beams that darted after. The maned ape roared with
fury as the beams lashed and stung it, and leaped high into the air,
plunging toward the huge Chaos demon.
<p>
The demon grinned, and spat another blast of white fire at the
hurtling ape--it would not dodge so well in mid-air.
<p>
<i>Something</i> darted between the blast and the ouzaru, something that
caught the blast and turned it aside to explode harmlessly in deep
space.
<p>
"Not so fast, demon!" snarled a tall dark figure, breathing
heavily. Antlers sprouted from its head, dark, leather skin covered it
from head to foot, and sharp bony spurs protruded from its major
joints.
<p>
"Piccolo? PICCOLO!" Gohan shouted as he hurtled into the fray. "You're
yourself again!"
<p>
"Not quite, but I can tell my friends from my enemies again--and ugly
down there isn't one of my friends!" Chaos-Piccolo smirked. "I am not
fond of Raditz, but the enemy of my enemy.."
<p>
"DIEEE!" The great Chaos demon roared, and spat balls of seething
flame high into the sky, dozens upon dozens of them, until the sky was
full of them. Piccolo rocketed into the sky with all his speed,
gaining the very edge of space; and two ouzaru slammed into Cacodemon.
<p>
BOOM! BO-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOOM! All of them exploded at once, filling
the sky with a sea of white fire; the concussion flattened trees for
miles around, and burned the tops of the mountains bare.
<p>
"YEARRGGHHHH!" Caught in the vast area blast, King Vibishana
burned. The once-invisible chariot and the demon tigers disintegrated,
carbonized and blown away by the blast front. Immortal Vibishana fell
burning from the sky.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
The ground exploded under Cacodemon's feet, and the great demon fell
into a newly blasted pit; the powerful crested ouzaru grabbed the
deadly tail stinger and ripped it out. The other, thoroughly enraged
maned ouzaru rained massive blows down on the great demon's head and
jaws--but somehow avoided the vampiric gem.
<p>
Cacodemon's head snapped to one side with the same incredible speed
that had fooled Piccolo--and bit down on the maned ape's hand. The
great ape bellowed in rage and pain as the Chaos demon shook his head
from side to side like a huge dog. Torn flesh and cracked bone finally
yielded and the maned ape howled as he staggered back, clutching his
severed right wrist. Red blood gushed out, washing away the demon's
vile spit. The maned ape finally spat fire at his severed wrist,
burning away the chaotic slime and cauterizing the ragged wound.
<p>
As he did so, the crested giant ape bit and tore at the demon's wings,
ripping them out of the monster's back in a fountain of black
blood--only to watch the flesh boil, twist and reshape itself into a
new set of wings. With a snarl of rage, the crested ouzaru flung
himself to one side as the newly regenerated stinger stabbed towards
his back.
<p>
Another blast from above collapsed the ground under Cacodemon again;
Gohan grinned fiercely, his hands still extended as he hovered high above.
"Come on, you big ugly monster! I'm the one you want!"
<p>
Cacodemon snapped his newly healed wings together and leaped into the
air--only to whip his head around and spit a cataclysmic blast of
white fire at the wounded, maned ouzaru. The great ape's crimson eyes
widened; another world-destroying blast--too powerful to survive, too
destructive to dodge and let hit the Earth. Ouzaru Raditz made his
decision, and braced himself to catch and deflect the blast--if he
could survive so long.
<p>
A streak of golden fire darted between the maned ape and the deadly
blast--caught it, and flung it high into the atmosphere where it
exploded with cataclysmic violence--the entire world turned white for
long moments.
<p>
The shock wave caught Gohan and Piccolo and flung them to the ground;
only the two ouzaru were strong enough to stand. Only the two
ouzaru--and Goku. Goku stood between Cacodemon and the maned ouzaru,
panting heavily, hands still extended from catching the blast. He
smirked again.
<p>
The white-tailed, crested ouzaru snarled a long, drawn-out growling
snarl, like an angry tiger; his eyes changed from glowing crimson to
dull black. Blackness stained his right hand; he leaped high, grabbing
the great demon by one leg and pulling him down with his immense
weight. The lethal tail stinger came darting down--only to be grabbed
by the black hand and torn away, again. Blackness entered the wound,
and the great ape laughted triumphantly as his black eyes turned
crimson once again, and his hand faded back to brown. "SEALED!" the
crested ape thundered, and Cacodemon howled as he looked at his maimed
tail--for it did not heal.
<p>

<p>
"What the--??" wondered Piccolo as he picked himself up. "How did he
stop the demon from regenerating?"
<p>
"Prince Vegeta used the power of the Death rune.. a dangerous thing
for the living to wield, if they be not sworn initiates of Death, nor
owners of the Death rune," came the voice of Mogris from behind.
<p>
Piccolo whirled; the auburn-haired woman regarded him suspiciously,
an ornately engraved sword in one hand. "Who are you?"
<p>
"I am Mogris, Hero of Orlanth, and chanced to travel with Prince
Vegeta from the Underworld, for his enemy is my enemy. Who are you?
You stink of Chaos, yet the sun-haired youth calls you friend, and
Cacodemon enemy--how can this be??"
<p>
"If by Chaos you mean this cursed transformation, it is nothing
natural to me, but a curse from that demon!" Piccolo growled; already
his head was throbbing as insane desires to kill and destroy for the
fun of it fought his iron control. "It would be better for you leave
this place!"
<p>
Her eyes narrowed. "Ah! He has afflicted you with the 'gifts' of
Chaos. Would ye be free of them?" Mogris came to a decision, and
raised her arms to the sky. "Scarf of Mist, hide us from our enemy!"
<p>
A fog sprang up and blanketed the seared meadow where Piccolo had come
to rest. The chaos-twisted Namek nodded. "Make it soon, if you can."
<p>
"Aye. I can do this but once, so hold still and do not move!" Mogris
sang in a long-forgotten language, and a blue light filled her
hands. Piccolo shivered as she laid those hands on his chest and head;
the insane thoughts and desires thrashing around in his head abruptly
stopped, and something like fear replaced them. Then the blue light
flared, and a cool flood of power poured through Piccolo, washing
through him and over him like a torrent of water, cleansing the
foulness that stained his body and mind.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Cacodemon lashed out with acid-slimed claws, raking and slashing the
great crested ouzaru again and again. Though its blood ran in rivers
down its furred sides, the great ape only laughed mockingly at the
Chaos demon--and struck back, sending the demon sprawling. Ravening
with fury, the great demon rose and spat white fire at the crested
ouzaru--who casually batted the terrible beam out of his way.
<p>
The Chaos demon's eyes narrowed to slits; his enemies were falling
into a pattern. The demon grinned, started to take a step forward--and
jumped back as Gohan blasted away the ground where he'd been about to
step. Then Cacodemon breathed his own blast out, catching the
surprised youth square on. Gohan barely had time to raise his arms in
a block before the great beam struck and exploded.
<p>
"GOHAN!" Goku yelled as Gohan's power vanished momentarily in the
tremendous wash of power as the world turned white again.  The
fireball burned away a small patch of fog, revealing Piccolo and the
Orlanthi warrior maid Mogris--far too close for safety.
<p>
Cacodemon slewed his head up and around, crimson eyebeams lancing out
to skewer and destroy the pulsing orb of lunar light. The great demon
grinned as the two ouzaru howled with rage, and collapsed--reverting
to their former shapes. Now he would finally destroy that cursed
Saiyajin Raditz!
<p>
Before they even finished transforming back, Goku smashed into
Cacodemon's legs, toppling the great demon again. "NO! I won't let you
kill my friends!"
<p>
Cacodemon's tail lashed out, catching Goku hard in the ribs, sending
the mighty Saiyajin flying. Goku quickly righted himself, only to see
Cacodemon's jaws gaping wide.
<p>
"YIIII!" He dodged the tremendous blast just in time.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Vegeta was the first to stand, still trembling from the exhausting
transformation. Raditz knelt nearby, holding his maimed arm and
groaning. His eyes opened wide as he looked at Vegeta.
<p>
"You've acquired a few new scars since I last saw you in the flesh,"
Raditz said sardonically, both eyebrows raised.
<p>
Vegeta glanced at himself, and smiled wryly. None of his armor or
clothing had survived the ouzaru transformation, except for the
wolfskin belt and pouch. He looked back at Raditz, whose white armor
and little else had survived transformation. "It's a good thing your
hair is so long, Raditz."
<p>
"What? Oh crud, not again!" Raditz looked down at himself. "And I'm
the one who insisted on the armor shell going high enough in the back
to clear my tail, too!"
<p>
Another brilliant flash and concussion shook the nearby mountains;
Goku and Gohan still fought Cacodemon. Vegeta pulled a senzu bean from
the fur pouch and ate it, sighing as the strength flooded back into
him. He flexed his hands--then ki flashed white around him, and Prince
Vegeta was clothed again. Blood red armor over black bodysuit, red
gloves and boots, and a blood red cape hung down from his shoulders.
<p>
Raditz's jaw dropped. "How did you do that?"
<p>
"Manifesting simple objects?" Vegeta sniffed. "The Namek can do
it. Did you think he could do something the Prince of the Saiyajin
could not?"
<p>
"Well, I can't do it!"
<p>
"Why not? You've seen it done." Vegeta extracted the second senzu and
studied it.
<p>
"When did I-- oh, yeah. I remember now--in the desert with Gohan. My
prince, I was dead at the time! I wasn't exactly there to study new
techniques!" ..I was condemned to experience the pain I'd caused
Gohan.
<p>
"That's no excuse!" Vegeta said haughtily. "Kakarott would have picked
it up in a instant; you were oblivious as usual." He rolled the senzu
bean between his fingers, still considering something.
<p>
"My prince.. I'm not Kakarott."
<p>
"No, you're not. You're pitifully weak, compared to your brother--why
you bothered to join this fight, when you couldn't possibly survive or
win, is beyond my understanding. What kind of fool throws himself in
the way of certain death for the sake of weaklings who are only good
for a few moments sport in the killing?" Vegeta tossed the bean into
the air and caught it.
<p>
Raditz stared blankly at Vegeta for a moment, then the gears of his
mind finally engaged. "I don't know, since such a fool would hardly be
able to give an intelligent opinion of himself." He smirked. "You tell
me."
<p>
Vegeta's ki flared, and Raditz suddenly found himself fully clothed,
black bodysuit under the white armor. "A loyal fool, who serves his
prince well." Vegeta flipped the bean to Raditz, who nimbly caught it
and ate it.
<p>
Prince Vegeta looked at his former companion of the long bitter years
under Frieza. "Do not transform again, and do not engage the monster
directly. Do as seems right otherwise."
<p>
Raditz gasped as his maimed arm healed, his hand rebuilding itself.
"You mean I'm still too weak for this, damn it!" Bitterness shaded his
voice.
<p>
"You are too valuable to waste," Vegeta replied, adjusting his
gloves. "But weak enough that I can spare you from the main attack to
deal with those matters neither I nor Kakarott nor the brat can be
spared to do."
<p>
Raditz regarded Vegeta speculatively. "My prince.. you know a way to
kill that thing, don't you?"
<p>
Vegeta smirked wickedly and did not answer at first.
<p>
"You do know something!" Raditz accused as he recognized that smile.
<p>
"And you are as oblivious as ever!" Vegeta looked up at the deadly
dance between Cacodemon and Goku.
<p>
Raditz looked sharply at Vegeta. "My prince.. Why is the demon
ignoring us?"
<p>
"Because I want him to--and King Vibishana still lives." Vegeta
smirked again, and flipped his cape back. "It is time."
<p>

<p>
Gohan shook, his breath coming in harsh gasps that pained his bruised
ribs. Three times he'd blocked the demon's titanic beams, three times
that he'd thought his desperate block would break, and that he'd be
consumed by the tidal wave of power. Each time, he'd reached deeper
into the Super-Saiyan, and still found no bottom. How much could he
take? All of it? <i>Was</i> there an upper limit to his power?
<p>
The boy scowled fiercely; that was nonsense! Anyway, Cacodemon had no
more power than what he'd stolen from Dad and himself--and Gohan had
fought Dad many times in practice. He could stand up to Dad's power.
<p>
Cacodemon's tail switched from side to side as he stared at Goku, the
blazing gem on his forehead pulsing in time with it. Goku did not seem
to be affected--he dodged and blocked yet again as Cacodemon spat a
cloud of small fireballs at him, followed up with a barrage of
eyebeams--
<p>
--Suddenly the great demon swerved abruptly in mid-fight, and hurtled
toward the ground. What was it? There were two people over there, one
down on the ground--
<p>
"NOOO!" Gohan shouted--one of the demon's targets was Piccolo! With a
sudden burst of speed, he put himself in front of the demon just as
the demon vomited white fire. Nearly in the demon jaws he blocked,
fending the deadly beam away--only to be flung backwards, slammed deep
into the nearest mountain by the tremendous power of the beam.
<p>
He's weakening, Gohan thought woozily. Last time he hit me this hard,
he knocked me out! Now I'm just embedded in a mountain...
<p>
"GOHAN!" Goku darted in and slammed his fist into the great demon's
nose, again--only to be intercepted by a concentrated barrage of the
crimson eye beams. All Goku could do was block the storm of needle
beams that lashed him-- and miss the great clawed hand that smashed
him into the ground. Cacodemon spat fire into the hole Goku's body
smashed into the earth.
<p>
"DIE, WHORE OF ORLANTH!" The great Chaos demon turned his head and
spat fire at Piccolo and Mogris.
<p>
"No--the spell isn't complete," Mogris protested. "So close--SHIELD!"
She invoked her last defensive spell, knowing it would not be
enough--but it might hold just long enough for her to complete
Piccolo's healing.
<p>
White fire struck and clawed at the translucent barrier surrounding
Mogris--a barrier that began to deform, bending inward under the
furious attack.  At first, it collapsed slowly, but then the fall
accelerated...
<p>
"DONE!" Mogris cried, scrambling to her feet--and her shield
collapsed. She stood, silhouetted in the white fury for an
instant--then she, too, crumbled and vanished like a leaf in a blast
furnace. Earth and sky turned white in the explosion.
<p>
"CACODEMON!" Suddenly, Vegeta was there, looking down at the monstrous
Chaos demon, cold hate in his turquoise eyes, hair blazing golden.
<p>
The great demon looked up, crimson eyes narrowing as he recognized the
suddenly unveiled ki of the small figure in black and red. "VEGETA!
COME TO DIE AGAIN? THIS TIME YOU WILL NOT BE SAVED; I WILL FEAST ON
YOU AND ALL WHO OPPOSE ME!"
<p>
The Saiyan prince's eyes flicked to one side as he noted Goku and
Gohan recovering from their latest setbacks--even Piccolo was joining
them. Good.
<p>
"I have a riddle for you, Cacodemon!" Vegeta grinned evilly. "Why do
vampires have no god??"
<p>
"WHAT??" The great demon bellowed. "VIVAMORT WAS SLAIN IN THE
GOD-TIME!" Cacodemon's bat-ears laid back flat against his dog-like
head, and the demon wrinkled its nose. "WHAT HAVE DEAD GODS TO DO WITH
DEAD SAIYAJIN?"
<p>
"I SLEW VIVAMORT, YOU FOOL, CACODEMON SPAWN OF WAKBOTH THE DEVIL!!"
Vegeta howled as he cupped his hands together, and a cool green light
began to flicker between them. "I destroyed him with the Death rune I
stole from Zorak Zoran, the same power that robbed you of your tail,
damned Child of DEAD Wakboth!"
<p>
Cacodemon's malevolent crimson orbs opened wide. "YOU WERE THE CRESTED
APE!" The great demon fell back a step. "YOU CANNOT SLAY ME WITH THE
DEATH RUNE--I HOLD IT, TOO, AND CANNOT BE SLAIN BY IT. DEATH HAS NO
POWER TO HOLD ME, FOOL!" Cacodemon snarled, ears still flat back; he
backed up another step as the power in Vegeta's hands grew.
<p>
Every vein on Vegeta's face stood out; the corded muscles in his neck
stood forth as hard and sharp as steel cables. Sweat poured down his
face, and he screamed as the power built to a seething crescendo.
<p>
"Enjoy the gift of Boztakang Chaosfighter, monster! COUNTERCHAOS!!"
<p>
A brilliant beam of spiral green energy shot out from between Vegeta's
cupped hands to strike Cacodemon in the face, square on the blazing
gem.
<p>
KR-KA-BOOOOOMM!!  The gem exploded--and the universe turned white for
a long moment.  When the fireball faded, Goku, Gohan, Raditz and
Piccolo gasped in shock. Cacodemon had changed.
<p>
The great demon was sprawled headlong, scrabbling weakly to
rise. Black blood ran down his face from the gaping wound where the
great gem had been. His eyes were dull red, no longer the blazing
crimson orbs they had been. The Chaos demon's skin sloughed off in
great ragged strips of fur and blubber as he staggered to his feet;
the long slimy claws faded, cracked and fell away.
<p>
"Kakarott! Don't stand there like an idiot, kill that thing! It won't
stay weakened forever!" Vegeta was breathing hard; most of his power
had gone into the Counterchaos.
<p>
"Allow me, since I seem to have missed most of the party," said
Kulilin's familiar voice. "KI-ENZAN!"
<p>
The raging disk of energy slashed down--and across the huge Chaos
demon's neck, neatly parting head and body in a spray of black blood.
The great body shuddered and collapsed, thrashing spasmodically.
<p>
"Hey, Kulilin!" Goku waved at his old friend.
<p>
"Kakarott! I'm out of senzu, give me one quick!" Vegeta snapped as he
watched the thrashing carcass intently.
<p>
"Sure, but what's the hurry? Kulilin just killed it, and you took away
its power of regeneration, right?" Goku asked as he reached from a
senzu bean.
<p>
"You heard the damned thing--it was telling the truth. As long as it
holds the Death rune, its spirit will keep re-gathering power and
coming back!  Now give me that damn bean!" Vegeta nimbly caught the
magic bean and ate it. "Better. Now to finish this."
<p>
Vegeta's eyes turned dull black, a stain that crept into his hair,
turning it from golden to glossy, glowing black as he plummeted down
to the twitching carcass of Cacodemon. A corona of black fire sheathed
his right hand, and he plunged it into the monstrous demon's skull,
into its foul brain.
<p>
Vegeta screamed; the severed head of Cacodemon opened its jaws and
howled with him, a terrible cacophony that nearly deafened Goku and
Gohan--and did deafen Piccolo. Raditz put his hands over his ears,
wincing.
<p>
Finally Vegeta wrenched his hand free, and staggered to his feet, the
unnatural blackness fading from his eyes and hair. "It..  is
finished. Destroy it." His hair faded from gold to its normal
black, his eyes rolled back in his head, and Vegeta collapsed to lay
as still as the dead monster beside him.

<p>
Raditz gently lifted the unconscious Vegeta in his arms and rose into
the air. "He's still alive--I think." The long-haired Saiyajin looked
worried. "What did he do, exactly?"
<p>
"I'm not sure," answered Goku; "but he destroyed the last of
Cacodemon's power. It's really dead, now."
<p>
"Dad?" Gohan looked from his dad to the fallen demon and back.
<p>
Goku nodded. "Do what Vegeta asked."
<p>
"KA.. ME.. HA.. ME-HA!" Gohan flung one last blast of ki, a brilliant
fireball that blazed up and utterly consumed what was left of the
demon.
<p>
"Goku, do you have a senzu left?" Raditz asked.
<p>
"Yes." Goku tossed a bean to Raditz.
<p>
"Thanks. I don't know if he'll need this, yet, or even if it will
help, but.." Raditz trailed off, still worried. "I'm taking him back
to Bulma." He smiled wryly. "I hope Chi-chi doesn't mind yet another
guest!"
<p>
"<i>Another</i> guest?" Kulilin wondered as Raditz sped off toward his
house.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Vegeta wandered in the fog for a while--then stopped abruptly as he
realized he'd been here before. He was in the borderland between life
and spirit, again!
<p>
"NO! I can't be dead again! <i>I</i> killed that damn demon--he did not
kill me!"
<p>
"Your body is not dead, but your spirit is severed from it, Prince
Vegeta." Before Vegeta loomed the tall, dark, sapphire-eyed King of
the Rakshasas. His red velvet cape stirred in an intangible breeze.
<p>
"What? How did that happ--damn! The Death rune!" Vegeta scowled and
clenched his fists.
<p>
Yes; you used powers not meant for a mortal body in the physical
world," pronounced King Vibishana. "When you tore the Death rune from
Cacodemon's spirit, you took it to yourself, and it acted on you as
Death acts on all men--but you hold it and control it, so you can not
fully die unless you will it. Neither can you fully live, for a mortal
body cannot embrace both Death and Life."
<p>
Prince Vegeta looked within, and saw that everything the Rakshasa King
said was true. If he held the Death rune, he could become something
monstrous, neither dead nor alive--and nearly invincible, able to kill
with a touch or a look. Not even Kakarott could withstand him, if his
will were the stronger..
<p>
..and he would never embrace Bulma again, nor look with pride upon his
young half-Saiyan son. Death has neither lovers nor children.
<p>
Bah! He could already kill anyone whose power was the weaker; he did
not need this.. atrocity. Kakarott would probably be immune to it,
anyway.
<p>
"How do I get rid of this thing?" Vegeta growled.
<p>
"Yield it up to he who rightfully bears it in this Time," King
Vibishana bowed respectfully to something large that loomed out of the
mist.
<p>
A large something that seemed to shift from one moment to the next,
first a large man with a stern, strong face and compassionate eyes,
and then a great white bull. Vegeta knew that what he saw was both
symbolic and real--this was part of the spirit realm, and spirits take
shapes representative of their true nature. Behind him was another,
the white bull's master, remote and dimly seen; a serene and immense
power that Vegeta did not want to see any closer, let alone disturb.
<p>
"Nandi is the faithful servant of Lord Sh--"
<p>
"Do not tell me!" Vegeta interrupted. "I know <i>what</i> he serves; I do
not care to know more!" The Saiyan Prince shuddered. "Take it; I give
it to you freely!"
<p>
The man who was a bull nodded and reached out to touch Vegeta's
spirit, plucking something dark and deadly from its depths. "You,
too, have served my lord well. Return in peace and be blessed."
<p>

<p>
In the Underworld, four lost souls came before Lord Enma for
judgement--and Negi was stuck with filling out the paperwork while
Nappa departed on other errands.
<p>
Errands, my low-class stubby tail! Negi thought darkly as he glared at
the skinny blue clerk-demon assisting him. Nappa's just going to see
his lady again, everyone knows that! Okay, let's see what I have to
give this twit so he can fill his stupid forms out and get off my
back...
<p>
"Kaeru, consigned to Hell of.. Hey, you! What's this character? I
don't know this Hell." Negi barked at the clerk-demon, who
cringed. Saiyajin made him nervous; they were so bad-tempered and
unpredictable!
<p>
"Uh, that's the Hell of Violent Perversion," the blue demon answered
timidly as he looked over the form. "You know, rapists and
sex-murderers and people like that."
<p>
"Violent Perversion?  Who thinks up these categories?" Negi shook his
head. "Gah. File him; he's Not My Problem Anymore.  Next.. Kidoru,
Hell of Petty Perversion, reincarnation when he gets his head out of
his--"
<p>
"*Ahem* That's not correct terminology, <i>sir</i>, and I cannot put it on
this form!" The clerk-demon protested primly.
<p>
Negi glared at the gaudly dressed blue demon with his one good
eye. Ripping the little twit's head off and using it for a football
would probably not impress the higher-ups, and would just cause Negi
further pain.
<p>
"You. Know. What. I. Mean," Negi growled.
<p>
"Ah, yes," the clerk-demon answered hastily. "I believe I can fill in
the details. Next?"
<p>
"Melchior..." Negi's eyebrows went up, and he stared silently for a
long time.
<p>
"Yes?" pressed the impatient clerk-demon.
<p>
Negi blinked. "He <i>really</i> didn't belong there!" the Saiyan warrior
said to himself, and then glared at the clerk-demon
again. "Melchior.. Heaven." Negi smirked. "Good. I liked the kid."
<p>
"Yes, well, um, next?" The clerk-demon hated prodding the touchy
Saiyajin, but his shift was almost over, except for this job...
<p>
"Last.. Pomona. Reincarnation..." Negi jumped abruptly to his feet. "I
have to double-check on this one." The little blue clerk-demon stared
after him as the one-eyed Saiyajin left.
<p>

<p>
Pomona shivered, alone with her anguish as she hovered between what
had been and what would be. Soon her previous life would be erased,
and another would begin; she wouldn't be Pomona anymore, but someone
else, with no memory of being Pomona.
<p>
Not that Pomona had been worth remembering.. before the Judge of the
Dead, her entire life had been revealed to her in all its pettiness,
emptiness, and selfishness.  She'd always thought of herself as good
and kind--only to discover that she'd never done things because they
were right, but because she wanted to stay out of trouble, that she'd
never been kind to anyone because she really cared about them, but
because she wanted to be liked and looked up to. How had she not seen
it before?
<p>
She liked people who were nice to her, who did things for her--but
she'd never really cared about them, never loved anyone. All her life
had been a selfish pursuit of her own comfort and her own desires--how
could she have been so blind, so petty, so.. childish!
<p>
A sob escaped her; if only--! If only she'd done things differently,
if things had been different, if she had been different.. Well, next
time they would be different, but would she?  Or would she spend
another lifetime making the same foolish mistakes, and learn the same
bitter truth at its end?
<p>
A gentle touch on her shoulder, and Pomona looked up, startled. It was
the demon warrior, Negi--but he didn't look very demonic just then. He
looked at her so strangely with that one good eye--and then gently
brushed one tear from her cheek. Only then did Pomona see the matching
tear in his eye.
<p>
"You regret..." was all he said, but the look on his face said far
more; it spoke of regret as deep as Hell, and empathy for the pain of
a wasted life.
<p>
Pomona remembered, suddenly, on the long climb up from Hell, how this
<i>demon</i> had caught her and held her several times when she'd fallen,
and gently helped her get back on her feet--to Melchior he'd been
merely aloof--but the other two! Those two had been grabbed roughly by
the handiest extremity and brutally thrown back on the stairs, scraped
and bleeding, every time they'd so much as tripped. From the evil
smirk on the face of the big bald demon, what they got was only to be
expected.
<p>
She had wasted her life on petty selfishness--and now found sympathy
from a demon in Hell! Pomona finally collapsed against Negi, weeping
bitter tears of regret for things done that could not be undone, for
things left undone that she would never have a chance to do, for a
lifetime of chances missed. Much to her surprise, Negi put his arms
around her and held her--though there was no warmth, no physical
attraction between the two dead souls, still she found comfort there.
<p>
"Yes.. I regret," she said at last. She looked at the dead
Saiyajin--Pomona could no longer think of him as a demon--and said
bitterly, "And I can't say, 'don't worry, I'll be fine'--I won't be
fine! I never was." She balled up her many-ringed fingers into
fists. "Why does it have to be this way?? It's not fair!"
<p>
Negi stirred at that. "Not true."
<p>
"Huh?" Pomona took a step back and stared at him; no one had ever told
her that when she was crying on their shoulder before! Friends had
always agreed with her, held her, told her how badly the world had
treated her...
<p>
The one-eyed warrior struggled to find the right words. He gestured as
he spoke, as if he had to seize the words physically before he used
them. "You.. I.. We made choices, made our own lives. No one else
did." He paused for a moment. "'Fair' is not the same as 'you like
it'."
<p>
Pomona looked at the damned warrior with new eyes; in Hell, this
violent murderer had shown her kindness.. and in this Limbo between
lives, he had given her truth. The pink-haired girl looked down at her
feet, avoiding Negi's gaze. "You.. are right." She looked at him
again. "You won't be fine, either."
<p>
"No. I.. made bad choices." Negi looked at her, considering. She will
be incarnated a human, on Earth. Perhaps.. it was finally time to let
go of the Saiyajin, to move on.. being human wouldn't be so
bad. "Soon, a new choice. Maybe better."
<p>
She smiled weakly. "Yeah, there is that hope. Maybe better."
<p>

<p>
Beyond Limbo, between Heaven and Hell runs Snake Way, and on Snake Way
stands the fabled Palace of the Jade Goddess called Princess
Snake. The Snake Goddess turned from the enchanted mirror to her
daughter, Kadru the Naga Princess.
<p>
"I told you it would be a simple matter to get dear Emmie to agree!
Your guardian lives, and we shall see you married to Prince Khara
before the year is out." Princess Snake pouted a bit, and then
smiled. "I could almost dislike King Vibishana for twisting my arm
like that--but he was quite correct. It <i>is</i> unthinkable that a mere
condemned spirit should be the guardian of <i>my</i> daughter, and it would
be an insult to send such to treat with the King of the Rakshasas
regarding his son's marriage. However, the <i>living</i> Prince of the
Saiyajin is--"
<p>
"..more than appropriate--Yes, mama, I know. You told me." Kadru
sighed; why did things have to move so slowly again? Things had
started <i>happening</i> when she'd gone off on her own with Prince Vegeta,
but now that mother was involved.. Kadru sighed again. Of course,
everything had to be done <i>properly</i>, but couldn't things speed up a
bit?
<p>
Something had changed during her long journey with the Saiyan Prince,
and it hadn't been the rest of the universe--no, the change was inside
her. Kadru no longer felt driven by the desperate need to please her
father, or to find a husband to please and be needed by and taken care
of by. She could take of herself, she'd proven that--all the gods knew
the ill-tempered, obnoxious Prince Vegeta certainly hadn't taken care
of her! (Well, not much; he <i>had</i> saved her from freezing in
Niflheim). She could also help someone who needed help, without
waiting around to 'be needed' by him--thanks to Prince Vegeta for
showing her that, too!
<p>
She still desperately wanted--<i>needed</i>--to be loved, but that could
not be forced. It would just have to come in its own time.. and at
least mother loved her. Kadru lowered her long black lashes with a
sigh. Until mother had taken her in and show Kadru her own love, Kadru
had never realized how little her father cared about her--the unlove
of indifference ran far deeper than hate.
<p>
Now what about Prince Khara? Kadru still hadn't met him--he'd left
Lankha on some quest just before the Ferryman had brought her
there. Beautiful Lankha had indeed lived up to its reputation, and had
been very nice to visit, and she thought she would enjoy living there
someday soon--but she'd come to see Khara and he wasn't there, so back
home she went.  Kadru sighed again, and settled her coils
comfortably. Oh well, patience.. After putting up with her father for
centuries, she could endure for a few short years.
<p>
Kadru started up with a sudden thought. Which one of her
ladies-in-waiting would mother send to set the terms of her marriage?
If it was Scylla, they were close enough in height and build in their
human forms... Maybe there was a way to get a peek at Prince Khara
before things were settled. Maybe. At least she would make very sure
he was not indifferent to her!

"Don't worry, your parents are alive," Raditz hastened to assure Bulma
as she gaped in horror at the destruction all around the compound.
<p>
By some miracle, their house and Dr. Brief's lab had escaped
Cacodemon's wrath. Everything else was gone, blasted and obliterated
by the brief fight there. Half the city burned; the other half was an
empty blast crater. What the earthquake had missed, the demon had
finished.
<p>
"Jesus!" Nezumi paled as she looked across the destruction. Prince
Khara carried her, while Sinhika carried Sean; Raditz had his hands
full with Bulma and the unconscious Vegeta. Trunks proudly flew on his
own.
<p>
"BULMA!" Mrs. Briefs ran out and flung her arms around her daughter as
they alighted on what was left of the lawn. Dr. Briefs followed close
behind, looking relieved. Bulma's mother then flung her arms around
Raditz and gave him a big hug--"Raditz! You saved my baby! And
Vegeta's back, too!"
<p>
After a short time, a few more capsule houses were decanted, and
everyone had a place to stay. Raditz would not leave Vegeta's side, at
first, so Bulma gave him a room in her new house--then Nezumi didn't
seem to want to leave, so she added on a room for her, too.
<p>
"You two don't need to hover right over me, you know! The demon's
dead, his followers are dead, no one is going to try and kidnap me,
okay?" Bulma was working on her old dragon radar, cleaning it and fine
tuning it--it would be needed soon. The exhausted Trunks was finally
in bed to stay. Vegeta, still unconscious, was also in bed; Bulma
figured the best thing for him was rest.
<p>
"I didn't expect anyone to kidnap you the first time," Raditz growled,
pacing back and forth.
<p>
"Ma'am, I'm what's left of the Capsule Corp Security Department, it's
my job to worry about these things," Nezumi said.
<p>
Bulma pushed the big knob on the dragon radar; it lit up and began to
beep, showing seven white dots scattered around the world. "Yes!
Perfect!" She turned it off again. "Fine! You two want to worry, hover
around the living room all you like; I'm going to bed!"
<p>
"Before you go to bed, can I help myself to this?" Nezumi held up a
jar of corn she'd found in the pantry.
<p>
"Oh, that," Bulma answered after yawning and stretching. "I don't know
why my father stocks that in the Capsule Houses--that kind is no good
for cooking, unless you grind your own cornmeal. You can have it if
you want." Another yawn, and Bulma headed down the hall to her own
bedroom.
<p>
Nezumi smirked--smirked!--knowingly and said, "I think I know a use
for it!" and disappeared into the kitchen. Shortly afterward came an
odd "pop-pop-pop" sound, and a delicious smell of roasted grain and
hot, salty oil wafted through the small house.
<p>
Raditz lifted his head up, sniffed once, and bolted into the
kitchen, stomach growling--
<p>
Nezumi emptied a big pot of.. <i>something</i> into an equally big
bowl. "Here, try this if you're still hungry!"
<p>
The delicious, tantalizing smell emanated from the bowl of puffy white
stuff. Raditz picked up the bowl and stared at it. It looked like
something used to stuff boxes with. "What is this, edible packing
material?"
<p>
Nezumi looked at the big Saiyajin, and smiled mischieviously. "It's
popcorn, silly. Try it."
<p>
The long-haired warrior scooped up a tentative handful and stuffed it
in his mouth. Raditz's eyes opened wide, and he reached for the rest
of the bowl. "Hey, this is good!"
<p>
"Yep." Nezumi grinned, and poured some more corn in the pot before she
put it back on the stove. Raditz watched her as she did so, admiring
her compact curves.  His tail switched from side to side.  Does she
have any idea what it means for her to privately offer food to an
unattached warrior like me? No, of course not, she's not Saiyajin, she
wouldn't know...
<p>
Then Raditz caught a glimpse of the smile on her face as Nezumi
briefly turned her face away from the stove.  His tail froze in an
arc; she knows! I don't know how, but she knows!
<p>
Mom was right, Nezumi thought to herself after catching a glimpse of
Raditz's face; the way to a man's heart <i>is</i> through his stomach!
<p>
"Raditz," she asked not-so-innocently, "if you're still hungry,
there's some steak in the fridge; how do you like it cooked?"
<p>
"Quickly," the big Saiyan warrior replied, smirking.
<p>

<p>
Consciousness slowly returned.  For a time, Vegeta lay quietly,
listening to a wondrous sound--his own heart, beating. He hadn't heard
that in a long, long time. After a while, the Saiyan prince realized
that there was something--no, <i>someone!</i>-- warm and naked and very
feminine curled up against his bare back. He opened his eyes.
<p>
Morning light filtered through the shaded window of the bedroom--of
their bedroom. He was home, in his own bed, and beside him... Vegeta
slowly turned over, careful not to disturb the person next to
him. <i>She</i> slept, blue hair spilling across the pillow, one arm still
draped over his waist.
<p>
Vegeta smiled, and very gently lifted the hair away from her neck. He
kissed her lightly but persistantly, starting on her throat at the
base of her jaw and working his way down. She began to stir by the
time Vegeta reached her collarbone.
<p>
"Mmmmmm! That's nice..." Bulma murmured, still mostly asleep.
<p>
"Yes, it is, isn't it?" Vegeta whispered in her ear.
<p>
Bulma's eyes flew open.  "Vegeta! You're--"
<p>
"Alive and back on Earth--or else we're both in Heaven, and I don't
think I've been quite <i>that</i> good," her prince said, as he caressed
her.
<p>
"YES!" Bulma shouted in pure joy.

"YOUR WISH.. IS GRANTED! FAREWELL!"
<p>
There was a brilliant flash, and the dragonballs scattered to the ends
of the Earth.

<p>
Sean dabbed another streak of ochre on the new painting and studied it
critically. "Yeah, that's about right. A little more shading on the
hair.."  He was in a good mood--he was back in his old apartment, his
old friends were back, and the only downside was that the cockroaches
were back, too.
<p>
"Your talent is impressive," Sinhika noted, closing the door behind
her.
<p>
The black-haired artist straightened abruptly. "You're back! I didn't
expect you so soon," he said as he embraced his demon lover...

In a place of cool white power, Bardock knew himself again, and found
that he was not alone; <i>she</i> was with him.
<p>
*Kinoko? KINOKO!*
<p>
*Welcome, my love. I have missed you.*
<p>
*It has been.. long. I thought it would be forever. How can this be?*
<p>
*You do not belong there any more.*
<p>
*I understand, now.. If I had only understood from the beginning.. So
much pain..  Yet if I had not been there.. I had to be there for the
two young ones!*
<p>
*Have I not said our path is a hard one? Yet there is good at the
end.*
<p>
*Yes.. it is <i>very</i> good.*
