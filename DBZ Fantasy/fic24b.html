<P>On a large, strange looking ship in space, a creature talks to his 3 top men. "When will we be at Planet Earth?" asked the creature.

<P>"According to this we should be there in 6 hours, Lord Bobocco," said the first man.

<P>"Excellent," said Bobocco. "After getting 100,000 years worth of training in a single day, I, Bobocco, of the Planet Arlia, am going to get my revenge on that dirty saiyan prince for destroying my home planet!"

Episode 15: A New Evil</H3>

<P>"Dad, can you feel that?" asked Gohan.

<P>"Yes, son, I can," replied Goku. "But there's an even stronger power out there that I can feel too."

<P>Gohan gasped. "I feel the stronger one too now."

<P>Meanwhile at Capsule Corporation...

<P>"Who can it be!" shouted Vegeta. "One feels as strong as Cell and one is stronger. The stronger one is twice as strong as Jaspou was."

<P>"Are you sure, father?" asked Trunks.

<P>"Absolutely."

<P>'Vegeta,' said Goku, telepathically,'I think one of the powers is that Glacial person; you know, Frieza's son.'

<P>'I think you're right Kakarot.'

<P>'Listen, Vegeta. The weaker power is going to be here in about 5 1/2 hours. Go up to Dende's for the Hypervolic Time Chamber.'

<P>'Fine. I'll meet you there.'

<P>Everyone used the Instant Transmission to get to Dende's.

<P>"Dende, do you know who it is?" asked Gohan.

<P>"No, I'm sorry," replied Dende. "I can't reach that far into space."

<P>"Let's just train," said Vegeta.

<P>"Right."

<P>Everyone went in to train some more. Gohan, Goku, Trunks, and Vegeta could all turn SS8 without fusing. Goten was SS7, and the Jrs were SS6. When they came out Goku had a question.

<P>"Hey Piccolo," said Goku,"what happened to Shinomiya?"

<P>"He went back to take care of Minoshiya," replied Piccolo. "He said Minoshiya was sick."

<P>"Oh. Come on, guys. Let's go fight some evil." They headed down to where Bobocco's ship had landed. The door opened and let out a hiss of steam. 10 men came out. Then 3 more. Then the last 1.

<P>"Hail Lord Bobocco!" shouted the first 10 men. Bobocco stepped out and glanced at the Z fighters as if he was looking for someone.

<P>"Prince Vegeta of the saiyans!" shouted Bobocco. "I'll explain why I'm here. You see, I was coming home to the planet Arlia with my men here and I saw two ships within the atmosphere. I got a close-up on the ships and I found out that they belonged to the saiyan Prince Vegeta and his partner, Nappa. Then, you fired a blast towards my planet and it exploded. The close-up said that your ships were headed to the planet Earth. After skimming the debris of my planet for many years, I went into a room that gave me 100,000 years of training in a single day. I'm here to get my revenge on you, you dirty prince, for destroying my planet."

<P>It looks like Vegeta's gonna have some explaining to do. But do the Z fighters have the power to destroy Bobocco and his men? And what about Glacial? Does he have anything to do with Bobocco? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

<P>Next time on Dragonball NR, the fight between Bobocco's men and the Z fighters begins! The Jrs take on Bobocco's first 10 men and Gohan, Goten, and Trunks go up against the top 3 men while Goku, Vegeta, and Bobocco watch from the sidelines. But, it turns out Glacial is approaching! Watch out!

Episode 16: The World's Not Big Enough for 2 Evils</H3>

<P>Previously on Dragonball NR, the Arlian, Bobocco lands on the Earth to get his revenge against Vegeta for destroying his home planet. Bobocco has trained in a room that gives him 100,000 years of training in a single day. Can the Z fighters defeat him? Find out today on Dragonball NR!

<P>"Big deal," said Vegeta. "I don't care what you're here for; I just want to get rid of you."

<P>"Go out, men," said Bobocco, sending out his first ten men. The Jrs stepped up to fight them. "Vegeta, you send out children to do your job? Pathetic."

<P>"You're the pathetic one! Those guys can handle your men no sweat."

<P>"Whatever. Bibiochi, Fibolitzu, and Dumdum, go get them!" Goten, Gohan, and Trunks went to fight them. By now Bobocco's first 10 men were gone. Suddenly Goku, Gohan, Trunks, and Vegeta gasped.

<P>"He's c-coming," stuttered Vegeta.

<P>"Who's coming?" said Bobocco.

<P>"Glacial." Bobocco rushed into his ship.

<P>"You're right. He's going to land over there." Bobocco pointed about 100 feet away from his ship. "Hurry up and kill them, men. We've got to get out of here!" Instead of his men killing Trunks, Goten, and Gohan, they killed Bobocco's men. "NOO!" Bobocco lunged at Vegeta. Vegeta knocked him into the ground.

<P>"You fool!" shouted Vegeta. "You should neve-" Vegeta was cut short by Glacial's ship landing. The door opened and 50 men came out, then 5 more. Then, Glacial came out. The looks; like father, like son.

<P>"Ahhh, Planet Earth." He looked over the scene with Bobocco on the ground; the Z fighters staring at him. "Oh, excuse me, am I intruding?"

<P>"You have the same bad sense of humor that your father did," said Goku.

<P>"I've only said 2 sentences and I'm already insulted. How rude of you. Men, go get them!" The first 50 men went out, but easily got killed. Glacial looked over at Bobocco.

<P>"My father sent you to destroy Planet Earth, but you failed so he came himself and met his death at the hands of Trunks. So did the late King Cold."

<P>"Hey," said Bobocco,"I was searching the debris of my planet and then I came here to destroy it and get revenge on Vegeta."

<P>"I'll kill you for letting my father die! It should have been you!" Glacial went into combat with Bobocco.

<P>"Hey," said Gohan,"leave our planet if you're going to fight each other."

<P>"Shut up!" said Glacial. Gohan went up and kicked Glacial in the face, sending him to the ground. "RRR! Dobiachi, dispose of him!" Dobiachi started attacking Gohan. "Gochiami, kill Bobocco."

<P>Bobocco blasted Gochiami into the next dimension as Gochiami flew up to him.

<P>"Only one evil is going to get to fight the Z warriors and that's me!" shouted Glacial. "Sadiopa, destroy Bobocco, now!"


<P>It looks like the Z warriors have a bigger problem than getting rid of Bobocco. But are they strong enough to take out Glacial? And is revenge the only thing Glacial's after? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

<P>Next time on Dragonball NR, Glacial does a little remodeling to Bobocco's ship! But Bobocco's unsatisfactory anger lets out on Glacial big time! Is Glacial going to live? And is Glacial's power as strong as everyone thinks? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

Episode 17: Death, Traitors, and Reinforcements</H3>

<P>Previously on Dragonball NR, Bobocco's men were easily disposed of but then Glacial landed! Most of his men were destroyed as well, but he wanted revenge on Bobocco! After being knocked into the ground by Gohan, Glacial sent some of his remaining men to kill Gohan and Bobocco. Bobocco destroyed the first one, Gochiami and then Glacial sent out Sadiopa to kill him while Gohan fought with Dobiachi. Are the Z fighters strong enough to destroy Glacial? Find out today on Dragonball NR!

<P>Sadiopa lunged at Bobocco. Bobocco fired a blast but Sadiopa dodged it.

<P>Gohan fired a Mesenkos at Dobiachi. It hit him, leaving a hole in his stomach. Dobiachi fell to the ground, lifeless. "Who's next?" Gohan shouted to Glacial. "You send out your men that aren't any good. What's the point?"

<P>"The point, my dear boy, is that up until now you've been fighting my weaker men." Bobocco destroyed Sadiopa. "These last 2, Wexasito and Mukolata, are a lot stronger than the other 3."

<P>"Whatever." Gohan fought Mukolata and Wexasito fought Bobocco. After dropping out of hand-to-hand combat, Mukolata and Wexasito started powering up and fused together! They became Wexalata!

<P>"Big."

<P>"Shit."

<P>Wexalata raced towards Gohan while Bobocco fired a blast at the Jrs. Goku Jr and Vegeta Jr dodged it but Gohan Jr didn't.

<P>"I thought we had teamed up!" shouted Gohan to Bobocco.

<P>"You thought wrong!"

<P>"Vegeta Jr," said Trunks,"you and Goku Jr take Gohan Jr back to Dende's and give him a senzu bean. Then just stay up there with Dende and Mr. Popo."

<P>"Aww, man." But Vegeta Jr did as he was told.

<P>Goten flew up to help Gohan and Bobocco started fighting Vegeta. Even with Goten's help, they still weren't winning, so Gohan, Goten, and Vegeta all turned SS5. Goten and Gohan were now even on power with Wexalata. Goku tried to help Vegeta, but he shouted,"Kakarot I can handle this myself!" Then Vegeta turned SS7 and was even with Bobocco.

<P>Goku looked over at Glacial, who was looking pleased. Goku rushed over and started fighting him as a SS7. Glacial was surprised and was knocked into the ground. Glacial got back up and started attacking Goku. Trunks came and helped Goku as a SS7.

<P>Gohan and Goten fused and became Gotan. Gotan attacked Wexalata, who began transforming. A force of invisible energy wave came from Wexalata, throwing Gotan backwards.

<P>Vegeta fired a Big Bang at Bobocco, who fired a blast called the Occo Occurance. The 2 blasts met in mid-air.

<P>Goku and Trunks fused into Gokunks. Gokunks then shot towards Glacial as a SS8. Glacial began to fight with Gokunks as another ship landed. Everyone looked towards it.

<P>"What the-?" said Gotan

<P>"Yes!" said Bobocco.

<P>What? Another ship? Who could it be this time? Could Bobocco's delightfulness mean that there's more Arlians? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

<P>Next time on Dragonball NR, the inhabitants of the new ship reveal their indentities! Quite familiar looking, but never seen before, the new enemies join up with Bobocco as his struggle to get revenge on Vegeta continues. But Glacial would rather miss the fun as he leaves the battlefield on a common evil quest! Wexalata is finally done transforming and is way stronger than before. Will Planet Earth ever be returned to peace? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

Episode 18: A Common Quest</H3>

<P>Previously on Dragonball NR, Bobocco and Gohan fought off Glacial's men. When it came to the last two, they fused and Bobocco turned traitor, firing a blast at the Jrs. After the Jrs go back to Dende's, Goten went up to help Gohan fight Wexalata. Vegeta fought Bobocco all by himself and Goku and Trunks faced Glacial. Goku and Trunks then fused into Gokunks. Gokunks and Glacial were about to go head-to-head when another ship landed! Who is it this time? Find out today on Dragonball NR!

<P>The door of the ship opened. 3 familiar-looking creatures came out. "Lord Bobocco!" The creatures looked just like Cell Jrs.

<P>"Retordit, Quiniset, Losadugrap, you came!" shouted Bobocco. Bobocco forgot about his blast for a moment and was sent 20 feet backward.

<P>"You'll need to pay attention if you're going to fight me!" shouted Vegeta.

<P>"Well, excuse me for being happy," replied Bobocco.

<P>"You're not excused!" shouted Vegeta, putting more power into his blast.

<P>Glacial began laughing. "As I see, and as my father predicted, you've learned how to fuse. Congratulations. You've lived up to my expectations. But, I also see that you've forgotten why Frieza went to Namek in the first place. He was after the Dragonballs. He didn't come there and wait for you earthlings to intervene. He was seeking immortality. That's also the reason Vegeta first came to Earth. Bobocco was only here for revenge and I'm here for that too. But I'm also here for the Dragonballs. You see, the evil quest of immortality interests me. And, that could also help me get my revenge. So, goodbye!" Glacial fired a blast at Gokunks and sped off in search of the Dragonballs.

<P>"Hey," shouted Gokunks, dodging Glacial's blast. "Glacial is after the Dragonballs! We have to stop him! I'll go after him!" Gokunks then went back into Goku and Trunks and they went in the direction that Glacial had gone in.

<P>Just then, Bobocco put more power into his blast and leapt away from the blast. Retordit went up and punched Vegeta in the face. Then, Quiniset knocked Vegeta to the ground. Vegeta got up, his face bloody, and turned SS8.

<P>"Damn Arlians," said Vegeta. "I'll destroy you this instant!" Vegeta began powering up and Quiniset lunged toward Vegeta, trying to get him before he fired his blast. Quiniset was too late. "Big Bang Attack!" shouted Vegeta. The Big Bang destroyed Quiniset and Retordit. Losadugrap came up behind Vegeta and smashed him into the side of a cliff.

<P>"Aarrrrrrr!" shouted Vegeta, jumping into the air. "You fools! Didn't you here Kakarot and my son? Glacial is going after the Dragonballs! If he gets his wish he will become immortal! Then he will destroy you too. Don't you care?"

<P>"No, Glacial won't destroy us," said Bobocco, "because we worked for Frieza. He told us to follow him to Earth with his father and we followed in our ships. But our ships were much slower than Frieza's, and he had been on Earth for quite a while, when all of a sudden, his power level just disappeared! Then, a few minutes later, so was his father's! Our scanners indicated that their ship had been destroyed as well. But, before Frieza's power level was diminished, his Death Ball attack came at our ships and mine was the only 1 that survived. Our scanners sensed that you were on this planet, Vegeta. So, I decided to train. Later on, we sensed a huge power level on your planet. And a creature came off of your planet and was destroying rocks in space. Then he returned and got destroyed."

<P>"That was Cell," said Vegeta. "Why are you the only Arlian that looks like the ones I destroyed? The others look like Cell Jrs."

<P>"Cell...Jrs?"

<P>"Little freaks that Cell could make."

<P>"Oh. Ever since we felt that huge power, Arlian babies began to look like that. These are my children that came. I hope this clears things up."

<P>"It sure did," said Vegeta. "Galic Gun!" The blast shot straight towards Bobocco and Losadugrap. "You fool, you just gave me time to power up! Hahahaha!"

<P>It looks like Bobocco has bigger things to worry about than why Frieza died. But is Vegeta's blast going to be enough? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

<P>Next time on Dragonball NR, stealing Bobocco's ship, Vegeta goes looking for a strange force that has to do with Glacial on a distant planet. Glacial has given Goku and Trunks the slip and is quickly gathering the Dragonballs. Wexalata and Gotan go into their last round. Who will come out on top? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

Episode 19: A Missing Link</H3>

<P>Previously on Dragonball NR, Bobocco got some reinforcements, 2 of whom were destroyed by Vegeta immediately. Glacial fought the newly-fused Gokunks but left, searching for the Dragonballs. Gokunks unfused into Goku and Trunks and they chased after him. Bobocco gave Vegeta a history lesson about himself, which gave Vegeta enough time to prepare a Galic Gun, which is currently heading towards Bobocco and Losadugrap. Is this the final blow against the Arlian race? Find out today on Dragonball NR!

<P>"Whoa," said Gotan. "His power level is huge already."

<P>Wexalata then finished transforming. He charged at Gotan like a raging bull. Gotan got thrown threw 8 mountains and skidded to a stop at the 9th. Gotan got up and started gathering energy.

<P>"What!" shouted Losadugrap. "How can this be?"

<P>"Vegeta, no!" shouted Bobocco. Everyone looked over. The blast hit head-on. A huge billow of smoke came up, shadowing the answer to whether or not the last of the Arlians had been destroyed.

<P>Gotan fired a new move called the Kamesenkos at Wexalata. Wexalata fired a Lata Blast, which got easily destroyed in Gotan's Kamesenkos. The Kamesenkos headed straight for Wexalata and destroyed him. Gotan then unfused into Gohan and Goten.

<P>The smoke from Vegeta's Galic Gun cleared, leaving half of Bobocco and Losadugrap completely gone. Bobocco looked over at Vegeta, Gohan, and Goten. "Glacial will destroy you all. He has a power source. You'll never find it. Even if you destroy every planet in the universe you will not have destroyed it. It is impossible to find and makes Glacial incredibly strong. I guess I'll go join Frieza in the HFIL now. Goodbye. Hahahahaha!" Bobocco then faded away.

<P>Vegeta looked in the direction Goku, Trunks, and Glacial had gone, then he flew over to Bobocco's ship, where Gohan and Goten were. Vegeta started getting in Bobocco's ship. "Good, a training room."

<P>"Where are you going, Vegeta?" asked Gohan.

<P>"To find Glacial's power source."

<P>"I'll follow behind in behind in the other ship. Goten, you tell dad where I went. See ya later."

<P>"Bye, Gohan," said Goten. Goten watched Vegeta's and Gohan's ships blast off and then went to find Goku and Trunks.

<P>Meanwhile, Dende was healing Gohan Jr at his lookout. "Hey Dende," said Vegeta Jr. "Can we go train now?"

<P>"Let me contact your father and Goku first," replied Dende. "I need to talk to them anyway. I made another set of Dragonballs."

<P>Goku and Trunks had lost sight of Glacial but they were following his power level. "Goku, Trunks, can you here me," said Dende.

<P>"Yeah, we can hear you," said Goku. "What's up?"

<P>"I made another set of Dragonballs that will react with the old ones. You just need one with each amount of stars."

<P>"Glacial is going after the Dragonballs," said Goku. "Could you look and see how many he has?"

<P>"Sure," said Dende. Dende concentrated his mind and got a picture of Glacial. Dende saw that Glacial already had 3 Dragonballs. "Goku, he has 3."

<P>"What! How could he get them that fast? Wait, can you disable the part where the different sets react with each other?"

<P>"I'm sorry, Goku. I can't. Not right now anyways. I'd just have to train and learn the ability."

<P>"Or you could ask Piccolo about it. He fused with Kami and Kami might know something about it."

<P>"Okay, I'll do that," said Dende. "And the Jrs want to train. Is that okay?"

<P>"Sure," said Trunks. "Tell them to train their hardest."

<P>"Okay, talk to you later."

<P>"Bye." Dende told the Jrs to go train.

<P>Vegeta had started training on Bobocco's ship and he and Gohan were headed to 2 of Glacial's planets. (i.e. The planet Vegeta went to after his fight on Earth before he went to Namek.)

<P>Goten sped up to his fastest to catch up to Goku and Trunks. "Hey, dad, we defeated Bobocco and Gohan and Vegeta went into space to find Glacial's power source."

<P>"This situation is getting out of control," said Trunks.

<P>You can say that again, Trunks! With the last of the Arlian race eliminated, the Z fighters only problem now is Glacial. If he gets immortality then the entire universe will be destroyed. Will Gohan and Vegeta be able to find Glacial's power source? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

<P>Next time on Dragonball NR, Gohan and Vegeta begin their search for Glacial's power source while Goku, Goten, and Trunks spread out to gather at least some of the Dragonballs before Glacial can get to them. When Trunks goes after one, he sees Glacial is after the same one he is and they go into battle. Dende talks to Piccolo and finds out how to disable the Dragonballs just in time. Will the Z fighters be able to destroy Glacial before he gets immortality? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!
