<b>What if Piccolo hadn't been such a blabber-mouth and not mentioned the Dragon 
Balls to Raditsu?</b>- Submitted by <a href="mailto:Saiyan141@aol.com">Saiyan141</a><br>
The entire Vegeta/Nappa and Freezer Sagas would disappear, the Androids would later kill everyone, since they didn't have any need to 
train, and nobody would ever become a Super Saiya-jin!!!

<b>What if Cell could absorb Android #16?
By:<a href="mailto:JTo7473949@aol.com">Slade the Dude with tude 
</a></b>
<br>
Cell woulnd destroy 16 in the cell Games hes absorb him and then Gohan would 
go SSJ2 over 16 being absorbed.As for Cell hed become Super Perfect Cell and 
his form would change and he would be like 20 times stronger than he was 
before.Then seeing Gohans power was no match for his power he would destroy 
the Earth seeing he no equal.Goku would then try to stop him going SSJ3 which 
would have no effect what so ever and the everything the Z Warriors did to 
stop Cell would help at all and Cell would destroy the Earth with a giant 
Kamahame Wave and disapear into space looking for planets to destoy and what 
ever life was out there.Cell would be the only person in the Universe Alive 
and sooner or later he get lonly and destroy himself cause there was no one 
to fight and no one left to destroy.

<b>What if Goku and Gohan went in the hyperbolic time chamber twice in the Cell saga? By:<a href="mailto:Spoilded@aol.com ">Spoilded@aol.com </a></b>
<br>
Goku  would probably acheive Super 
Saiyain 2.When battling Cell Goku would go SS2 and whoop Cell's butt. 
Goku would get tired and Cell would blow up the ring.Cell would Kill 16 
and Krillin maybe causing Gohan and Goku to go SS3.Goku and Gohan 
would simply blast and Kill Cell.Buu would be killed by goku and Gohan. 
Eventally They would discover SS5 and SS4 and SS6 and be the most 
powerful fighters that ever existed.Vegeta would always be one step behind 
and The Majin Vegeta saga would end rather quickly. 

<BR><BR>

<b>What if Kami never split with Piccolo but became gaurdian of Earth?  Submitted by:<a href="mailto:Spoilded@aol.com">Spoilded@aol.com</a></b>
<br>Krillin and Chaotzuwould not die.Goku would have never battled Piccolo and 
Goku would die from Raditz.Gohan would get mad and kill Raditz.They'd  train 
to fight the sayians.Gohan would be trained by Roshi. 
would train Gohan so Gohan learned Kamehameha sooner.Krillin,Gohan 
and the other fighters would battle the Saiyains.The saibemen would be 
killed by Krillin.Then Nappa would kill Tein,Chaotzu,and Yamcha.Goku would 
come and it would be like it was the regular saeson.Goku trained 
under King kai.They'd go off looking for Dragon balls.When it was wish 
time Tein would probably be wshed back.Tein would replace Piccolo 
against Freiza.It would pretty much be the same.After Trunks came 
Krillin would probablt train with Goku and Gohan.When battleing 20 
Vegeta would probably not let enyone but himself battle 20.Tein would 
fight Cell instead of Piccolo.They'll have all of the hyperbolic time chamber 
stuff.They'd build that remote.Cell would come when Tein the one who 
is replacing Piccolo is battleing 17.Tein and 17 would get beat up.16 
would fight Cell.In the Cell battle Cell would have no regeneration Cell's so 
16 would probably kill him.Not much would change in the Buu saga. 
<br><br>

<b>What if Cell had to absorb Andriod 16-20 to become complete?
 By:<a href="mailto:Spoilded@aol.com ">Spoilded@aol.com </a></b>
<br>    
Cell would go  into the past ,battle Piccolo and learn 19 and 20 were killed. 
Trunks would arive with the others so Cell would use solar flare find Trunk's 
time machine and go a little earlier.Cell would arrive just 
when Vegeta went super saiyain.Cell would tell everyone about 
him and 20 would willingly be absorbed.19 being loyal to Dr.Gero would be 
next.Gohan would try to stop Cell from absorbing 19.19 would fly off to 
awaken 17,18,and 16.Gohan wolud lose and 19 would wake up the andriods.17 
would convince  19  too forget about Dr.Gero and hang out with 17,18, and 
16.19 would join them.Cell would be looking for them while the Z-warriors 
fight 17,18 and 19.Krillin would try to make them stop but they wouldn't.19 
would ask if he could absorb some of 17's ki so he could be as powerful s 
16(17 and 18 didn't know how strong 16 was)so 
19 would now be super strong.They would stael the car and have those road 
adventtures when looking for Goku.Piccolo would fuse with Kami 
and Vegeta and Trunks would go in the hyperbolic time chamber. 
Cell would arrive when Piccolo 
and 17 are fighting.17 and 16 would be absorbed.19  would try 
but also get absorbed.Then 18.It would pretty much be the same Dbz from 
there.Except now 19 will be a Z-fighter helping out against Buu.

<b>What if Mr. PoPo discovered the truth about the Dark Star Dragonballs 
before GT Possible Consequence 1? 
 </b>-Submitted by <a href="mailto:Strwar4me@aol.com ">Strwar4me@aol.com </a>
<br>Goku would destroy them before a wish could be made.  9 months later, Bebi 
would come to Earth and possess everyone ending the series 

<br><br>


<b>What if Gohan had listened to Goku and killed Cell when he told him to? 
 </b>-Submitted by <a href="mailto:Strwar4me@aol.com ">Strwar4me@aol.com </a>
<br>Gohan would be the winner of the Cell Games.  He would become known as the 
person who saved earth from Cell.  The whole Other World Tournament saga 
would not take place because Goku and King Kai would still be alive.  Krillin 
would eventually marry 18 and have a daughter named Marron.  Goku would eat a 
senzu bean to restore his power and would have the ability to go Super Saiyan 
2.  Goku would be alive to see Goten born.  Chi Chi wouldn't let Gohan or 
Goten ever stop studying because her attitude about that would not change 
because Goku hadn't died.  Goku would train and find a way to go Super Saiyan 
3.  The rest of DBZ would turn out the same.  

<br><br>

<b>What If Goku didn't know Instant Transmission? 
 </b>-Submitted by <a href="mailto:Strwar4me@aol.com ">Strwar4me@aol.com </a>
<br>First of all, Goku would not be able to bring Dende to Earth.  There would be 
no dragonballs on Earth, so no one Cell killed could be brought back.  The 
Cell Games would still be the same except for the fact that Goku wouldn't be 
able to teleport Cell to King Kai's planet once Cell blew himself up.  He 
would explode and take the Earth and everything on it with him.  Cell would 
regenerate himself and conquer every planet in the universe. 

<br><br>

<b>What if Krillin had married Marron? 
 </b>-Submitted by <a href="mailto:Strwar4me@aol.com ">Strwar4me@aol.com </a>
<br>Marron would want to go everywhere Krillin would go.  She would annoy the 
heck out of Chi Chi and Bulma.  She would want to learn how to fly.  Krillin 
would teach her.  She wouldn't want Krillin to train for three years to 
battle the Androids, but he would tell her she could train with him.  She 
would allow him to train.  By the end of the three years, Krillin would be a 
dad.  The battle with 19 and 20 would still be the same except for Marron 
being there and annoying 20.  The battle with 17 and 18 would be the same 
except for the fact that Krillin wouldn't get kissed by 18.  The whole 
Imperfect to Near-Perfect Cell thing would be the same except for the fact 
that Krillin would have no problem whatsoever pushing the button Bulma 
created to shut down 18.  Krillin would blast her into smithereens before 16 
could find out where he was as soon as he deactivated her.  Cell would now be 
stuck in his Near-Perfect form.  Vegeta or Trunks (Most likely Trunks) would 
kill cell.  Trunks would return to his time and kill the Androids and Cell 
there.  Vegeta, Goku, Gohan, and Piccolo would all train over the next seven 
years, but first Dende would be brought to Earth to be the new Guardian.   
Gohan would figure out a way to release his hidden power and then go Super 
Saiyan 2.  Goku would make it to Super Saiyan 2 and 3.  The whole Other World 
Tournament Saga wouldn't exist.  The rest of the series would be the same. 

<br><br>

<b>What if there was no Bulma?  </b>-Submitted by <a href="mailto:Strwar4me@aol.com ">Strwar4me@aol.com </a>
<br>Goku would have never started his search for the dragonballs.  Shao and Mai 
would come for the four-star dragonball.  Goku would defeat them and take 
their dragonballs.  Goku would lose to Yamcha in the desert because there 
would be no Bulma to scare him away.  Yamcha would steal his dragonballs and 
stay evil.  Goku would eventually meet Master Roshi and train under him with 
Krillin.  The rest of Dragonball would pretty much stay the same.  In 
Dragonball Z, Goku would die from the heart virus because Trunks would never 
come to give him the cure because Bulma would never create the time machine 
or give birth to Trunks because she wouldn't exist. 
<br><br>

<b>What if Kaio didn't give his life for Goku but still trained Gohan? </b>-Submitted by <a href="mailto:Strwar4me@aol.com ">Strwar4me@aol.com </a>
<br>Gohan would come in his Ultimate form and kill Vegeta.  Gohan would realize 
that he would never see Goku again.  Something would snap.  Gohan would go 
Super Saiyan 3.  He would power up all the way and go to battle Boo.  He 
would kill Boo right away.  Years would pass, and Pilaf would show up at 
Kami's place.  Gohan would stop him from using the Dark Star dragonballs and 
kill him.  The rest of GT would be the same except for the fact that Goku 
would be dead, and Gohan would have to do what his father did in the series.<br><br>


<b>What if Goku had held onto Raditz's tail? </b>-Submitted by <a href="mailto:Strwar4me@aol.com ">Strwar4me@aol.com </a>
<br>Piccolo would have killed Raditz.  Vegeta and Nappa wouldn't have come to 
avenge him because they would have given a crap.  The Namek and Frieza sagas 
wouldn't exist.  The Garlic Jr. saga would still come and go.  The Androids 
would wipe out all the Z Warriors even if Trunks warned them about them 
because they would have been taking it easy.<br><br>

<b>What if Gohan also went Super Saiyan when Frieza killed Krillin?  
 </b>-Submitted by <a href="mailto:Strwar4me@aol.com ">Strwar4me@aol.com </a>
<br>Goku's strength alone could finish, but he would probably let Gohan help kill 
Frieza.  Then again, Gohan could be more ticked off than Goku after seeing 
his mentor and best friend both hurt by Frieza.  Gohan could kill Frieza in 
one blast.  All the Nameks and Vegeta could be wished back with the help of 
the Earth's dragonballs and King Kai.  The Namekian dragon would return with 
Guru alive.  The Nameks would wish for their planet to be restored.  Dende 
would heal Piccolo.  The Z Fighters and Vegeta would stay on Namek until the 
dragonballs had power again.  Krillin would be wished back.  Yamcha and Tien 
would also be wished back.  The Nameks would promise that they would wish 
Chiaotzu back, and the Z Warriors and Vegeta would return to Earth.  They 
would face Garlic Jr. together.  Vegeta, thinking he could kill him, would 
give it everything he had.  Vegeta would realize he wasn't strong enough and 
get ticked off.  He would go Super Saiyan.  Garlic Jr. would open the Dead 
Zone to suck Vegeta in, but Vegeta would blast Garlic into the Dead Zone 
easily.  Chiaotzu would be wished back by the Nameks.  King Kold would go to 
Namek and find out who killed his son.  He would take Cooler with him to 
Earth.  Goku and Gohan would kick some Frieza family ass.  King Kold and 
Cooler would be dead within a few minutes.  Trunks would show up from the 
future and inform every one of the Androids.  The Z Warriors would train for 
three years.  In that time, Goku would get the heart virus and use the 
medicine Trunks gave him to cure it.  He would heal and be just fine.  He and 
Gohan would train with Piccolo and go Super Saiyan 2.  Vegeta would be 
furious.  He would train until he could go Super Saiyan 2, too.  He would 
find that he just wouldn't be able to do it.  The three years of training 
would end.  The Z Warriors would go to fight the Androids.  They would wait 
with Bulma and Chibi Trunks on the island 9 miles southwest of South City.   
The Androids would show up.  They would still be 19 and 20.  19 would easily 
be destroyed.  20 would run away.  The Z Warriors would follow him back to 
his lab.  They would kill him before he had the chance to awaken Android 16, 
17, and 18.  Goku and Gohan would kill these three easily.  Cell would appear 
a few days later.  Piccolo would fuse with Kami to become stronger.  Goku 
wouldn't be able to go get Dende to make new dragonballs to bring back 
everyone Cell killed because he wouldn't know Instant Transmission since he 
didn't go to Planet Yardvek to learn it.  Cell would tell Piccolo his origin 
during their battle.  Piccolo would tell Cell that the Androids had already 
been destroyed.  Cell would try his best to kill Piccolo but would eventually 
get killed.  Goku would ask King Kai if there was a quicker way to get to 
Namek than taking a ship.  King Kai would use Instant Transmission to get to 
Goku and would teach it to him.  Dende would create new dragonballs, and Goku 
would gather them up.  The dragon would be summoned.  The first wish would be 
to bring back all those killed by Cell.  The wish would be granted.  Krillin 
would ask Goku if he could wish back Androids 16, 17, and 18.  Trunks and 
Goku would think he was nuts.  Krillin would explain that they didn't do 
anything wrong.  He would also say that 18 is kind of cute.  Everyone would 
laugh at him but let him make the wish.  Krillin would go to Dr. Gero's lab 
and wake up the Androids.  He would tell them that they had been wished back 
with the dragonballs but would be killed again if they did anything wrong.   
Krillin would tell them that he had suggested that they be wished back.  The 
Androids would thank him.  They would tell him that they were going to kill 
Goku.  Krillin would tell them that they don't have a chance.  The Androids 
would scan for Goku's power.  They would find it to be superior to theirs.   
The Androids would forget about killing Goku and live peacefully on Earth.   
Krillin and 18 would eventually marry and have a daughter named Marron.   
Gohan would study until Chi Chi would allow him breaks.  He would then train 
with his dad.  Goku and Gohan would find a way to tap deeper into their 
powers and go Super Saiyan 3.  Goku would have sex with Chi Chi and have a 
son named Goten.  Goten would grow to be as strong as Gohan was at age 5.   
Goku would train Goten and help him go Super Saiyan.  Vegeta would make Chibi 
Trunks go Super Saiyan as soon as he learned to crawl.  Meanwhile, in the 
future, Trunks would have destroyed the Androids and Cell.  He would have had 
King Kai bring Dende to Earth.  He would have had Dende make new dragonballs. 
Trunks would wish back everyone killed by Cell, the Androids, and the heart 
virus.  Unfortunatly, Babidi would come to Earth looking for Boo.  The Z 
Warriors would kill Babidi and Dabura.  The rest of the future would be 
peaceful.  Back in the present, the 25th World Martial Arts Tournament would 
take place.  Every Z Warrior would enter.  Gohan would win the Junior 
Division with his Super Saiyan 3 form. Vegeta would go Super Saiyan 2 and 
battle Super Saiyan 3 Goku in the finals.  Goku would win.  Hercule would be 
at the tournament and call all the kai attacks magic tricks.  Babidi and 
Dabura would show up and release Boo.  Goku would fight Boo and run out of 
power.  Boo would beat the crap out of Goku.  Gohan would battle Boo but 
would also be defeated.  Boo would threaten to kill Gohan.  This would make 
Goku mad.  Goku would automatically go Super Saiyan4 skipping the Golden 
Oozaru stage.  Goku would kick Boo's ass.  Goku would kill Babidi, Boo, and 
Dabura.  Everything would be peaceful on earth once again.  The dragon would 
bring back anyone killed by Boo.  Vegeta would mumble a wish that he would be 
as strong as Goku.  Vegeta would go Super Saiyan 3 then 4.  Vegeta would 
suggest that he and Goku spar.  Goku and Vegeta's powers would be equal.   
While they were battling, Pilaf would be plotting against Goku.  He would 
find out about the Dark Star dragonballs much sooner than he should have and 
head to Kami's Lookout.  He would find the balls but would be stopped from 
making a wish by Gohan.  Mr. PoPo would tell Gohan to destroy the balls.   
Gohan would power up to Super Saiyan 3.  He would try to destroy them with a 
Kamehameha.  The balls would be able to take it since a young Kami who would 
have had Piccolo inside him and would have been a lot stronger young than old 
made them.  Meaning Kami would have been stronger than a Super Saiyan at 
stage 3 and would somehow have found a way to keep them from disappearing if 
he disappeared.  Gohan would think of what would happen if he didn't destroy 
the balls and go Super Saiyan 4.  He would destroy the balls with his 
Kamehameha wave.  The sparring match between Goku and Vegeta would be a tie.   
Bebi would arrive nine months later.  Gohan would kill him before he could 
possess anyone.  There would be no Super 17 saga.  There would be no evil 
Shenlong saga.  Goku would live out the rest of his life in peace, except for 
the occasional argument with Chi Chi. Gohan would marry Videl and have a 
daughter named Pan.  The whole Z gang would live happy lives.
