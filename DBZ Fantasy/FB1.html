<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial">Act 1: Tenshinhan Fights 
Until Goku Comes to the Rescue </span></u>
<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
Tenshinhan tries in all his efforts to try and kill Piccolo Daimou, but has no 
luck. Dorumu is really beating him up, to the point of death. Just when Dorumu 
is about to deliver the final blow, Goku shows up. After training at Korin 
Tower, Goku has some new tricks to show them all. After zanzoukening out of 
sight, he reappears in front of Dorumu, and, knocks him out. This knocking out 
also has the loss of Dorumu's eye. In other words, Goku kicks him so hard, his 
left eye flies out. This makes Piccolo Daimou very pissed. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial">Act. 2: Piccolo Daimou 
Attacks Son Goku</span></u><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
This is just a mini-fight between Goku and Piccolo, and nothing really big 
happens. Nothing, except for that Goku is beating Piccolo up badly. Goku even 
attempts to throw Piccolo long distances and deflecting ki blasts to go back at 
Piccolo. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial">Act 3: Piccolo Attacks Son 
Goku and Tenshinhan Comes to Save the Day </span></u>
<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
Now, the battle gets intense. Piccolo tries all of his best moves on Goku, and, 
sometimes he does actually hit Goku. One time was, when Goku couldn't see 
Piccolo's blast from behind, and, Tenshinhan had to step in. Tien saved Goku's 
life, and, made Piccolo even more upset. Now, it was all or nothing. Piccolo was 
going to start to do some serious evil works. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial">Act 4: Piccolo Daimou's 
Trump Card Against Son Goku </span></u>
<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
Piccolo fires a blast straight at Tenshinhan, causing him to be paralyzed. Goku 
still cannot move real well, but won't give up. Piccolo then grabs Tien's head, 
and, starts to make demands. Piccolo will let Tien go, only if Goku gives up his 
own life. If he doesn't, Tien's head will be crushed without hesitation. Goku, 
being noble as he is, says he won't give up. Piccolo demands he thinks it over 
again, and Goku says he has already made up his mind. Piccolo decides to cripple 
Goku as well. He shoots a ki blast straight into Goku's knee, causing Goku to 
not being able to move. Goku doesn't have any choice, but, to give up now.
</span></p>
<p><u><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial">Act 5: Son Goku 
Finally Kills Piccolo Daimou </span></u>
<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
Piccolo asks what does Goku want to do, and, Goku tells him that he will give 
up. Piccolo agrees with him, and puts Tien down. Piccolo starts his flight into 
the air, and, starts to build up enormous ki. Goku remembers all the people that 
he hurt and will hurt if he doesn't do something. His only choice is to shoot a 
Kamehameha at him, but his left arm is broken. So, he starts to power up a 
Kamehameha in his feet. After gathering the necessary energy, Goku lets loose 
the Kamehameha, and starts to fly at Piccolo. Piccolo cannot believe what he is 
seeing and lets the ki energy he has now at Goku. Goku, however, didn't give up, 
and, flew higher and higher until he connected with Piccolo, and, went straight 
through Piccolo, leaving a big hole in Piccolo. This was a mortal wound and was 
making Piccolo loose allot of power, even dieing. Piccolo could only spit up an 
egg that would soon be our next enemy, in our next final battle.</span>
