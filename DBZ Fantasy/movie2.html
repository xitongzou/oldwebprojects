  - The World's Strongest</font></h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">This film starts off with Piccolo training
  solitarily in an icy mountain range, unable to so much as crack the stubborn, rigid, and
  enormous things.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Gohan and Oolong are in search of the
  Dragonballs, with Oolongs goal to wish for panties. They notice that all the Dragonballs
  are gathering in one place, via looking at the Dragon radar. They approach their
  destination slowly, andget closer and closer.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Meanwhile, an old, frail man named Dr
  Kochen is the one who collected all the Dragonballs, and has set them up on top of an icy
  cavern. He calls out Shenron, and wishes for the ice to be melted so his mentor &#150; Dr
  Willow &#150; could finally be released from his tomb. Using incredible power, Shenron
  grants the wish, then disappears, along with the Dragonballs. A huge structure has been
  raised, and Dr Kochen makes his evil intentions clear.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Gohan and Oolong wander along, when
  suddenly a group of creatures attack them, pushing Oolong out of the way, and beating
  Gohan to a pulp. Piccolo steps in though, and rescues his friend, easily defeating all of
  the saibamen-look-a-likes. Gohan loses grasp of his consciousness, and fades away. Piccolo
  looks around, then is hit by some sort of red aura soaring out of the group, putting him
  in a great deal of pain.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Gohan and Oolong wake up, hurt only
  slightly, and wondering where Piccolo has gone. They assume he went home, and they do the
  same.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">On Roshi&#146;s island, Bulma and Oolong
  are in the kitchen, cooking intently. The doorbell rings, and turtle answers it. The
  saibamen-look-a-likes are here for Roshi! The old man comes out, and makes it clear that
  he has no interest in fighting. He doesn&#146;t have a choice though, and the three
  creatures jump on him, trying to hurt him, but failing miserably, as Roshi easily beats
  them across the floor. He turns to walk off, but a man claps. It&#146;s Kochen! He tells
  Roshi that it is just what he expected from the strongest man in the world, and that he is
  going to accompany him to Dr Willow. Roshi explains that he doesn&#146;t want to go, but
  the saibamen creatures have captured Bulma, threatening to harm her if Roshi doesn&#146;t
  co-operate. He has no choice but to go with them.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Goku finds out what has happened, and sets
  off on his nimbus, to find and rescue both Bulma and Roshi.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Roshi stand in darkness, with Bulma chained
  up, unable to escape. Kochen releases three bio warriors, with a short fight ensuing.
  Roshi is the eventual loser of this though, with the bio warriors being far too powerful
  for him.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Bulma informs Kochen that Roshi isn&#146;t
  the strongest man in the world anymore, so they should leave him alone. Dr Willow now
  speaks, and demands to know who the worlds strongest is. Bulma remembers them by name, and
  says that they should have died in an avalanche. Kochen reveals Dr Willow, a huge brain
  floating in water, and tells that his body as destroyed in the avalanche, but his brain
  was able to survive. Bulma is astounded, then tells them both that Goku is now the
  strongest fighter in the world. Dr Willow and Dr Kochen reveal that Willow will take Goku&#146;s
  body, and insert his great mind into it, making the most powerful person in the universe.
  Willow reveals that his plan is for revenge, like so many other villains.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Goku finally arrives, with Dr Willow
  noticing his incredible power. He steps up to the door, but is attacked by a large, yellow
  monster. It is one of the bio warriors that defeated Roshi! Goku has to run inside because
  he is unable to gain any power due to the terrible coldness of the buildings location. He
  moves into a far warmer room, with the fat yellow monster in hot pursuit. He stops, and
  battles with the monster for a while, eventually managing to defeat him by ripping through
  his huge, flexible stomach with the use of a kai-o-ken power up. He moves so fast that
  after he bursts through the monsters stomach, he goes straight through the roof, and into
  a new room.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">He meets two more bio warriors here, and
  after a fairly large fight, he manages to beat them, with more than a little help from
  Gohan and Krillen. Goku moves into the main chamber, and located Dr Willow. Before he can
  do anything though, Piccolo steps in front of him, with some sort of yellow veins on his
  head. The two are forced to fight, with Goku not understanding why Piccolo is doing this.
  Gohan keeps foolishly getting in the way, and getting beat up by Piccolo. Gohan gets so
  mad that he releases surges of energy, with such force that they make the veins on Piccolo&#146;s
  head disappear, and Dr Willow hurt badly.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Dr Willow is mad at this, and stands up,
  creating a huge gap in the ground, which Dr Kochen falls down, revealing himself to be
  nothing more than a robot. Willow is in a huge mechanical suit, and easily beats up the
  combo of Goku, Gohan, Piccolo, Roshi, and Krillen, with the size of all of them put
  together, and then some. He puts a beating on everyone, but in the end Goku comes through,
  with an incredibly powerful KameHameHa, with having such force that Dr Willow is shot
  straight through the roof of the building, into the depths of space. Goku knows it&#146;s
  not over though, and begins charging up a spirit bomb. Willow recovers, and begins to
  charge up an attack of his own. He shoots it down, as everyone but Goku run out of the
  collapsing building. Goku finishes his spirit bomb, but is unable to throw it due to being
  pummelled by the power of Willow&#146;s energy beam. Everyone thinks that it is over, as
  Gohan and Piccolo fly up towards Willow in fits of rage, later joined by Krillen. They
  rough up the evil mastermind for a while, before he shoots an incredible beam of energy
  down at the Earth, hoping to destroy it. Luckily though, Goku has somehow recovered, and
  charged up a spirit bomb. He throws it up, intercepting the beam, and pushing it back,
  eventually destroying Dr Willow.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">And so the bad guy is dead, and the world
  is saved from the depths of turmoil once again by Goku and the others.</font></small>
