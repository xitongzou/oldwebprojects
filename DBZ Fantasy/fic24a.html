Episode 1: The Big Fight and the Little Scuffle</H3>

<P>Goku, Vegeta, Yamcha, Tienshinhan, and Chiaotzu were all dead. Krillin was in the hospital. Gohan, Goten, Trunks, Goku Jr(Gohan's son), Gohan Jr(Goten's son), and Vegeta Jr(Trunks' son), were at Krillin's bedside.

<P>"Please don't die, Krillin," said Gohan.

<P>Goku Jr asked, "How did this happen?"
  
<P>"Well," said Krillin."It all started when these guys came here from space."

<P>"They planted a tree called the Tree of Might. Goku started powering up, and, the head guy named Turlis, his scouter exploded, and then Goku killed him. But, Turlis sent out a distress call on his scouter just before it exploded. It took the guys that got the distress call 20 years to get here, and the strongest fighters on the planet weren't as strong as before, but they insisted on fighting anyways. The saiyans that came killed them though. Gohan here saved me but, I don't think I'm going to make it."

<P>"Don't say that Krillin," said Gohan. "I know you'll make it." He turned to the others. "Those saiyans told me that they're going to come back in 1 year. So, we're going to train. All of us."

<P>"Hey, guys go get in the Capsule plane, I'll be right out." The others left Gohan and Krillin. However, Vegeta Jr, just like his grandpa, Vegeta was devilish. He hid outside the door to listen.

<P>"Krillin, I know you're going to die. I just don't want to let the little Jrs be sad. Well, see ya!"

<P>"Gohan, wait," said Krillin. "Goku gave this to me to give to you after he died." Krillin handed Gohan an antique watch. "Krillin..."

<P>"Look inside, said Krillin.

<P>"It's a picture of everybody," said Gohan.

<P>Meanwhile...

<P>Gohan Jr was looking for Vegeta Jr. "There you are! What in tarnation are you doing?"

<P>"Shhhh! You're starting to sound like my mom."

<P>"Shut up! Come on, we're supposed to be at the Capsule plane."

<P>"No, I'm listening to their conversation."

<P>"Do you want me to get your dad?"

<P>"Go away!"

<P>"Okay, I'll go away and get your dad, you loser."

<P>That did it. "Who are you calling a loser? At least my uncle's not a nerd."

<P>"Oh yeah? At least my aunt doesn't absolutely have to wear her name!"

<P>"SHUT UP! KAME-HAME-HA!"

<P>Just then, Trunks rushed in, and Gohan heard the yelling went to see what was up. Trunks ran up and hit the blast out a hospital window. All the doctors and nurses were shocked. Goten and Goku Jr rushed in.

<P>"Vegeta Jr, you're grounded!" said Trunks.

<P>"It's a free country," said Vegeta Jr.

<P>"I'm your father, that's my final answer, and for that remark, your grounded for 3 months. The only exception is for training for the saiyans."

<P>"Ok, Mr. Philbin."

<P>Gohan ran back to Krillin. "See ya later." 

<P>Krillin moaned, "Bye."

<P>Next time on Dragonball NR, evil is back! The Ginyu Force and Garlic Jr and his henchmen! But how? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

Episode 2: The Return of Evil</H3>

<P>Previously on Dragonball NR, a little hospital incident leaves Vegeta Jr grounded. And is Gohan wrong about Krillin dying?

<P>It was late that night at Dende's lookout, where the Z fighters had been training. Gohan was up looking at the stars. Gohan Jr came up to him. "What are you doing up so late, Uncle Gohan? Are you waiting for someone? I'll wait with you."

<P>"No, just thinking...," mumbled Gohan. 

<P>"Is Mr. Piccolo going to train with us tomorrow? Is he even alive? I haven't seen him in a long time," said Gohan Jr. 

<P>"Oh, he's alive all right. I think I will go see him tomorrow, and ask him if he wants to train with us," said Gohan.

<P>Just then Trunks, Goten, and Goku Jr. came out. "Vegeta Jr will be out in a minute," said Trunks. "He's trading 2 months of being grounded for writing that he won't fire a blast in public again unless he is doing it against evil. He's writing it 200,000 times."

<P>"200,000?! Holy crud," said Gohan Jr.

<P>"You forgot he has super speed like you," said Trunks.

<P>"Oh, yeah," said Gohan Jr. "Darn."

<P>Vegeta Jr came out then. "One more thing, you owe Gohan Jr an apologie," said Trunks.

<P>"Oh man," said Vegeta Jr. "Okay, sorry Gohan Jr."

<P>The next morning....

<P>"See ya later guys," said Gohan. "I'm going to go get Piccolo." At that exact moment, Piccolo landed behind Gohan. 

<P>"You won't have to go far." 

<P>Gohan turned and said,"Hi Piccolo! You come to train?"

<P>"Sure did," said Piccolo. "There's a fighting tournament in 6 months also. It's on an island 9 miles southwest of South City at 10 o'clock in the morning. That might help."

<P>"Thanks for the news, Piccolo," said Goten.

<P>"Sure thing," said Piccolo.

<P>Then they went to train. Gohan paired up with Piccolo, Goten with Trunks, and the juniors switched off.

<P>Later that night...

<P>"Nice night," said Gohan.

<P>Just then 5 figures landed behind them. It was the Ginyu Force!

<P>"Well, well, well, what do we have here?," said Captain Ginyu.

<P>"I say we slice 'em, and then blast 'em, mate!"

<P>"Oh, great," said Gohan. "The cooky austrailian's here too."

<P>"Shut up," said Jeice.

<P>"Ooh, goody, the little squirt has grown up," said Recoome.

<P>"Hey, who's that little squirt that looks like Vegeta?," asked Guldo.

<P>"That little squirt is Vegeta's grandson," said Trunks. "His name is Vegeta Jr."

<P>"Where's that freaky saiyan with wierd hair?," asked Burter.

<P>"His name is Goku," said Gohan. "And he's dead. How'd you get out of that frog's body anyways, Captain Cocky?"

<P>"It was easy," said Captain Ginyu. "After a while, I could talk and then, I went and found my body, and changed back. Then I found the dragonballs and wished the rest of the force back."

<P>Just then, guess who else showed up? The Spice Boys and Garlic Jr!

<P>"Who are you?"

<P>"Who are you?"

<P>"I'm Captain Ginyu, leader of the Ginyu Force."

<P>"I'm Garlic Jr, and these guys are the Spice Boys."

<P>"How did you escape this time Garlic breath?" Piccolo had came outside.

<P>"Well, someone wished back the Makyo Star and you know the rest," said Garlic Jr.

<P>"You can leave me responsible for that," said Jeice. "You want to join forces?"

<P>"Let's do that, Lord Garlic," said Spice.

<P>"Okay, why not? We'll send one of each of our groups out at a time."

<P>"Who are these guys, Uncle Gohan?," asked Gohan Jr.

<P>"Wierdos," said Gohan. "Don't worry, Trunks, your dad, and I will take care of them."

<P>"This will be some great training," said Trunks.

<P>Next time on Dragonball NR, the battle finally begins! But what's this? A Super Ginyu?!

Episode 3: A Fight for All</H3>

<P>Previously on Dragonball NR, Garlic Jr, his henchmen, and the Ginyu Force all show up to fight. But are they stronger than before? Find out on today's episode of Dragonball NR!

<P>"Guldo, you first," said Captain Ginyu. "You go too, Salt," said Garlic Jr.

<P>"Trunks, I've got an idea to scare Captain Cocky over there," said Gohan. "Turn Super Saiyan. He was scared of the saiyans just like Frieza was."

<P>"Alright," said Trunks. "Here goes!"

<P>Both Gohan and Trunks turned Super Saiyan.

<P>"WHAT! The-they've become Su-Super Saiyans," said Captain Ginyu.

<P>"Not only that," said Gohan. "Super Saiyan Level 2 also. Trunks, now!"

<P>Both Gohan and Trunks turned Super Saiyan Level 2.

<P>"Mustard, you go too," said Garlic Jr.

<P>"Recoome, come on," said Ginyu. "Both of us are going out."

<P>(I guess I forgot to mention that the Ginyu force is stronger now.)

<P>"Well, you can be Super Saiyans, but Jeice and I are Super Ginyu. We're a lot stronger now."

<P>"Goten," said Gohan. "You come on up here and turn Super Saiyan too.

<P>"Okay Gohan," said Goten, turning Super Saiyan.

<P>"Who's he?" asked Ginyu and Garlic Jr together.

<P>"My brother," said Gohan. "Now, are we going to fight, or not?"

<P>"Ready."

<P>"Set."

<P>"GO!"

<P>Trunks battled it out with Recoome and Mustard. Goten battled it out with Guldo and Salt. Piccolo tried to force Garlic Jr to battle but Spice and Vinegar got in the way, so, he fought them instead.

<P>Soon, Goten easily beat Guldo, Trunks beat Recoome, and Piccolo beat Vinegar, and Spice backed off.

<P>Meanwhile, Gohan was fighting Ginyu.

<P>"If you're such a 'Super Ginyu', then why don't you show me?" asked Gohan, dodging a punch.

<P>"If you really want me to, I will," said Ginyu. "It would be my pleasure."(Ginyu started to power up)

<P>"His power level!" shouted Trunks. "It's amazing!"

<P>Everyone was watching Ginyu power up.

<P>"Gohan, don't let him do it!" shouted Trunks.

<P>"Huh? How come?"

<P>"Can't you feel his power level?" said Trunks. "Can't you feel how high it is already?"

<P>"You're right," said Gohan. "I can't be like your father. MASENKOS!"

<P>The blast hit Ginyu head on, and killed him.

<P>"Great job, Gohan," said Trunks.

<P>Just then, while Salt was distracted, Goten killed him. Also, Trunks killed Mustard.

<P>Burter and Jeice stepped up. "Allow us to show you something the cap'n didn't even know about mates," said Jeice. They both started powering up.

<P>Next time on Dragonball NR, trouble is about! Burter and Jeice show off their new technique while the Juniors watch in awe. It's fusion time, next time on Dragonball NR!

Episode 4: The Fusion and Transformation Showdown</H3>

<P>Previously on Dragonball NR, Captain Ginyu, Guldo, Mustard, Salt, Recoome, and Vinegar all experienced death once again. In other words, it wasn't a good day to be a bad guy! Then, after the death of their leader, Burter and Jeice began to power up for a new move! And, how is Gohan going to defeat Garlic Jr this time? Find out today on Dragonball NR!

<P>Burter and Jeice kept powering up! They did a dance, then, they fused together!

<P>"Trunks," said Goten. "We need to fuse."

<P>"Okay." They fused into Gotenks.

<P>Meanwhile, Burter and Jeice's new form's height was about in between Burter and Jeice's and the new form looked like a yellow Burter with Jeice's hair, eyebrows, and eyes.

<P>"I'm Burtice," said the new form. "Who are you?"

<P>"I'm Gotenks."

<P>Gotenks and Burtice went into battle while Gohan finished off Spice. Gohan then went to challenge Garlic Jr.

<P>"Wow," said Vegeta Jr. "I love it!"

<P>"Amazing!" said Gohan Jr.

<P>"Downright awesome!" said Goku Jr.

<P>Meanwhile, Gohan was talking to Garlic Jr.

<P>"Where is your father, Gohan?'' asked Garlic Jr.

<P>"He's dead," said Gohan. "But I can still beat you."

<P>"Have you forgotten that I'm immortal?" asked Garlic Jr. "And I'm not stupid enough to get sucked into the Dead Zone again."

<P>"I did forget you were immortal," said Gohan. "But I still think you're stupid enough to get sucked into the Dead Zone again."

<P>"Shut up! Anyways you can't beat me because I'm immortal and I won't need to open the Dead Zone this time anyways. Awe, too bad huh?"

<P>"Y-you! I w-won't l-et you!" shouted Gohan. He began powering up. Everyone looked at Gohan. Garlic Jr decided to taunt him.

<P>"And just how may I ask how that you're going to defeat me when I'm immortal. You can't! Hahahahahahahaha!"

<P>Gohan began to transform.

<P>"He's turning Super Saiyan Level 3!" shouted Trunks.

<P>Gohan's hair grew and pointed down. He finished transforming!

<P>"Garlic Jr, there is a way to beat you," said the newly transformed Gohan. "My dad gave me this before he died. It can only be used once and it's called the Immortality Key. It can break the barrier of immortality. You just put it in your hand and fire a blast with that hand and you can kiss your immortality goodbye. So, MA-SEN-KOS!!"

<P>Gohan blew up Garlic Jr's head with his Masenkos and key and the rest of Garlic's body blew up too. Then, Gohan finished off Burtice.

<P>Gotenks separated back into Goten and Trunks. Gohan turned back to normal.

<P>"Glad that's over," said Gohan.

<P>Next time on Dragonball NR, Vegeta Jr and Trunks enter the Hypervolic Time Chamber for training. And, what's this? A saiyan base?!

<P>Previously on Dragonball NR, Burter and Jeice fused into Burtice! But, Gohan easily took care of him and Garlic Jr once he turned Super Saiyan 3! What new adventures will our heroes come upon? Find out today on Dragonball NR!

<P>It was late one night when Gohan was outside sitting alone. Trunks came out.

<P>"What are you doing Gohan?" asked Trunks.

<P>"I was thinking about going for a midnight flight. Want to come with?"

<P>"Sure."

<P>As they flew they talked.

<P>"I think you and Vegeta Jr should go into the Hypervolic Time Chamber tomorrow," said Gohan.

<P>"Good idea."

<P>"You seem distracted tonight, Trunks. Is anything wrong?"

<P>Before Trunks could reply they felt a HUGE power level.

<P>"Who is that?!" shouted Gohan.

<P>"Good question!" said Trunks.
	"It came from that direction,'' said Gohan, pointing east.

<P>They flew off in that direction until they saw something that looked like an army base.

<P>"It-it can't be," said Gohan.

<P>"What?'' asked Trunks.

<P>"Those saiyans are really here on Earth! Let's go take a look. But, be sure to keep your power level down."

<P>They crept up to one of the buildings. It was just a kitchen. They looked in another building. It was a training room! They crept up to another building. Inside there were saiyans making things that looked like scouters. In another building was the armor storeroom. Then there were dormitories in yet another building. Then, in the last building, they peered inside and saw saiyans making things that looked a lot like...

<P>"Androids!" whispered Trunks. "I bet their plan is to use androids that look like them. Then, we destroy the androids and they kill us while we're exausted."

<P>"I bet you're right," whispered Gohan. "You go ahead and go. I'm going to grab some scouters and armor."

<P>"Okay," said Trunks. "Don't get caught."

<P>Trunks flew off. Gohan used super speed to sneak in and out with the scouters and armor.

<P>The next morning Gohan and Trunks told everyone what had happened the night before. Then, Trunks and Vegeta Jr went into the Hypervolic Time Chamber.

<P>6 months later, on an island 9 miles southwest of South City at 10 o'clock in the morning, Gohan, Goten, Trunks, Goku Jr, Gohan Jr, Vegeta Jr, and Piccolo went to the competition.

<P>Not very many people showed up, but when they saw Gohan, Trunks, and Goten, they left.

<P>"I guess they remember our strength from before."

<P>All of a sudden, a loudspeaker came on. "May I have your attention please, the first match in the adult ring is Gohan vs Goten. The first match in the child's ring is Gohan Jr vs Goku Jr That is all."
	
<P>Next time on Dragonball NR, the Tournament finally begins! But, who will be the winner? And who's this other man?

<P>"Well guys, let's go."

<P>Gohan and Goten stepped into the ring. The started off by both of them turning Super Saiyan 3.

<P>"May the best man win," said Gohan.

<P>"Agreed," said Goten. They started fighting.

<P>Meanwhile in the child's ring...

<P>Goku Jr and Gohan Jr stepped into the ring.

<P>"May the best junior win," said Goku Jr.

<P>"Okay," said Gohan Jr. They started off by turning Super Saiyan 2.

<P>Goku Jr just dodged for a minute, but then he shouted,"KA-ME-HA-ME-HA!"

<P>Gohan Jr shouted,"MA-SEN-KOS!"

<P>The 2 blasts collided and neither seemed to be winning. Then Goku Jr put more power into his blast, but Gohan Jr wasn't fast enough. The blast overpowered his and Goku Jr won.

<P>"May I have your attention please, there has been a time-out called in the adult ring. And, the winner of the first match in the child's ring is Goku Jr. The second match in the child's ring, which will begin in 20 minutes is, Goku Jr vs Vegeta Jr. That is all."

<P>The juniors headed over to the adult ring to see what was happening. It looked like the time-out was over.

<P>"MASENKOS!" Gohan fired a blast at Goten, but it was too late for Goten. Gohan won.

<P>"Good fight Goten," said Gohan. Then, they all went to rest.

<P>15 minutes later, the loudspeaker came on again.

<P>"Attention, will the fighters for the childs' match please go to the ring. The next adult match will begin in 10 minutes. That is all."

<P>Goku Jr and Vegeta Jr went to the childs' ring while everyone else followed. Both started off the match by turning Super Saiyan 2.

<P>It looked like an even fight. But, very slowly, Goku Jr was gaining the upper hand. Finally, Vegeta Jr fell to the ground defeated.

<P>"Attention!" said the loudspeaker. "The winner of the child's match is Goku Jr. The next match in the adult ring is Piccolo vs Raddi. The awards will all be given out at the end. That is all."

<P>"And who the hell is Raddi?" asked Piccolo.

<P>"Maybe Radditz had a son before he came to Earth," joked Gohan.

<P>"We'll find out soon enough," said Trunks. "Let's get over to the adult ring."

<P>They went over to the adult ring and Piccolo gasped.

<P>"It's him. He's the one who killed Goku."

<P>"WHAT?!!" shouted Gohan. "I want to go and fight him!"

<P>Gohan started powering up as rage went through him. He first turned Super Saiyan. Then SS2. Then SS3. His tail popped out. He then turned Super Saiyan Level 4!

<P>"Gohan, calm down!" shouted Trunks. Gohan kept on going. His hair was starting to turn blonde. "Gohan, stop!"

<P>"Dad!" shouted Goku Jr. Gohan's hair was now completely blonde.

<P>"What?!" shouted Trunks. "Is he Super Saiyan Level 5? I thought it was just a rumor." Gohan calmed down but was still SS5.

<P>"Wow, dad, that was awesome!" exclaimed Goku Jr.

<P>"Last call for Piccolo in the adult ring," rang the loudspeaker.

<P>"Piccolo," Gohan said. "Go on out there and do your best to beat him."

<P>"Okay, Gohan. I'll do it for you and Goku."

<P>Piccolo went out there and fought hard but the saiyan was too powerful.

<P>"And the winner is Raddi! The next competition is between Trunks and ..."

<P>"Zibbiocho!"
	
<P>"NO!!" shouted Trunks. "It can't be him! It just can't!"
	
<P>"Who is that guy, Trunks?" asked Gohan.
	
<P>"He's one of Cell's offspring," said Trunks. "He teamed up with the saiyans. And he's the one who killed my father!!!"
	
<P>Trunks began to transform. He turned SS4. Then SS5.

<P>"Trunks!" shouted Gohan. "Control yourself. You can beat him."

<P>"You're right Gohan. I can and I will."

<P>And Trunks did just that.

<P>"Piccolo, Goten," said Trunks. "I want you to teach the juniors how to fuse."

<P>"Okay, bye!" They left.

<P>"Attention, the next match is Goku vs. Vegeta!"

<P>"Huh?!"

<P>"You thought we were dead?" asked Goku, stepping up.

<P>"We were Kakarot!" said Vegeta. "We just got our lives back!"

<P>"Father!" shouted Gohan and Trunks in unison.

<P>"Last call for Goku and Vegeta!"

<P>"See ya later."

<P>Goku and Vegeta both powered up to SS5. They seemed equal in power but then Goku powered up more and won.

<P>"Darn you Kakarot!" shouted Vegeta with rage.

<P>"Attention, the next match is Gohan vs Raddi."

<P>"Alright, he's as good as dead!" said Gohan with confidence.

<P>Raddi started beating Gohan down to the ground. He almost finished him off but Gohan's confidence in himself made him keep going. Then Gohan killed Raddi.

<P>"The next match is Trunks vs Goku."

<P>"This should be interesting," said Gohan.

<P>Trunks and Goku seemed equal in power. Goku dodged a punch and put his hands together for a Kamehameha. Goku fired with all his strength but Trunks was able to counter it with his own blast.

<P>Trunks then prepared a Galic Gun, which Vegeta had taught him. Goku then fired another Kamehameha. The 2 blasts collided and hit each other. Neither blast was overpowering the other. Then, there was an explosion which sent Goku and Trunks flying against the walls of the battlefield. Goku got back up and Trunks tried but couldn't.

<P>"Attention, Goku is the winner and after he is done resting, the final match between Gohan and Goku will begin."

<P>"Whew," said Goku, sitting down.

<P>After a quick rest, Goku went up to battle Gohan. Meanwhile, Trunks was nearby with Vegeta. "So father, how did you and Goku get your lives back?"

<P>"Kakarot got these 2 Kais or whatever they're called to give us their lives. I think one was East and other was South. Strange creatures they are."

<P>"Oh."

<P>"This should be a good match," said Vegeta.

<P>Next time, on Dragonball NR, Goku and Gohan finish the tournament in the final round! And, new fusions are finally made!

After a powerful showdown, Goku defeated Trunks and went to the Finals to face his first-born son, Gohan. Who will win? Father or son? Find out today on Dragonball NR!

<P>Goku and Gohan both started at SS5. They charged toward each other. Too many clashes to count followed. "KA-ME-HA-ME-HA!" shouted Goku. "MASENKOS!" shouted Gohan. The 2 blasts collided, neither able to overpower the other.

<P>"They seem equal in power," said Trunks. "I guess you and Goku did a lot of training while you were dead."

<P>"You bet."

<P>"Gohan, you can't beat me," said Goku. "You don't have it in your heart to do it. I'll always be ahead of you and it still won't be enough to face those saiyans. Everyone's going to die again and you won't be able to do anything about it. Never."

<P>"NOOO!" shouted Gohan, who started to power up even more. 'I hate not being able to help,' thought Gohan. 'Tien, Yamcha, Chiaotzu, and most of all Krillin. How could I let you die? How?'

<P>"AAHHHH!" Gohan let out a surge of anger, which became part of his power. He turned Super Saiyan Level 6!

<P>His eyes became a darker green and his hair turned a brighter gold. His hair was indescribable.

<P>"Huh?!" said Goku. Gohan blast over took his and Gohan won the match.

<P>"And Gohan is the winner of the 28th World Martial Arts Tournament!" shouted the announcer.

<P>Everyone was in awe. "H-he turned level 6?" stuttered Vegeta. "H-how?"

<P>"Good job, Gohan," said Trunks.

<P>'How could this happen?' thought Vegeta. 'Kakarot has overpassed me and even though we're the same level of Super Saiyan and now his son has achieved a level past that! I must train more!' Vegeta turned SS5 and took off.

<P>Just then Piccolo and Goten landed with the Jrs. "What's up with Vegeta?" asked Goten.

<P>"Guess he's angry that my dad and I have surpassed him," said Gohan, stepping down from the ring.

<P>"Goku, could I talk to you for a minute?" asked Trunks.

<P>"Sure."

<P>"Did you just say that to Gohan because you wanted him to get stronger before the battle?"

<P>"Gee, I guess that's gettin kinda old huh?"

<P>Trunks started to laugh. "Well, I guess you could say that." Then they went back to the group.

<P>"Mister Gohan, would you please come up and receive your prize money," said the announcer.

<P>Gohan walked up to him. "So you guys are the guys from the Cell Games? That's what I thought. That Hercule Satan is so full of it. He complained about a stomach ache when he saw you guys enter. But anyway, here's your 10 million zeni."

<P>"Thanks," said Gohan.

<P>Then they left.
	
<P>Now that the Tournament is over, our heroes can get back to normal training. What will Gohan do with the prize money? You'll have to stay tuned to find out.

Episode 9: A Familiar Looking Guest</H3>

<P>Previously on Dragonball NR, the final round of the tournament began with Gohan vs Goku. With a push from his father, Gohan was able to overcome the odds and reach a new level of Super Saiyan! Winning 10 million zeni wasn't what Gohan's objective of competing in the tournament; it was just an added bonus! On their way home, our heroes are unaware of the following figure who looks familiar. But who is it? Find out today, on Dragonball NR!

<P>"Why does everyone always surpass me?" shouted Vegeta, his words not reaching anyone. "Every time I get strong someone always surpasses me. When Kakarot and I came back, I thought for sure we were the only ones that powerful. But Gohan is already at our level and then reaches a new one!" He flew off into the sunset.

<P>Gohan and Goku stopped by home first before going back to Dende's Lookout.

<P>"GOKU?!" shouted Chichi. "Oh, Goku, you're alive again! Do I need to keep a leash on you to stop you from dying?"

<P>"Sorry, Chichi," said Goku, laughing. "I guess it's a bad habit. Vegeta's back too."

<P>"You're darn right it's a bad habit," said Chichi. "Everyone keeps thinking I'm a widow and then you show up again! And I don't care about Vegeta!"

<P>"Hey Mom," said Gohan,"we're planning to go back to Dende's to train. Is that alright with you?"

<P>"It's not like I have a choice, Gohan," said Chichi. "Because you'll just fly off and I can't stop you!"

<P>"Oh, and here's the prize money, Mom," said Gohan.

<P>"Thank you, dear," said Chichi.

<P>"Okay, see you."

<P>Chichi then called Bulma to tell her about Vegeta.

<P>Meanwhile, Goku, Gohan, Trunks, Goten, Piccolo, and the Jrs flew off towards Dende's Lookout. Trunks then looked back at Goku's house and saw something following them. "Hey!" Trunks shouted. "Behind!"

<P>Everyone turned to see a figure coming towards them. As it got closer, they saw that the figure looked a lot like Minoshiya.

<P>"Who are you?" asked Gohan.

<P>"I am Minoshiya's twin brother, Shinomiya," replied the figure. "I am here to help you train and fight the saiyans. Minoshiya told me to come here to help because I'm stronger than he is."

<P>"Good," said Goku,"then come on." Shinomiya flew in between Goku and Gohan. Then they left for Dende's Lookout.

<P>Meanwhile...

<P>"Why can't I ever be stronger than Kakarot?!" shouted Vegeta. "His son surpasses me too! As a true saiyan, being brought back from the dead should have made me indestructable! I had surpassed Kakarot while we were dead and I should have stayed stronger when we came back to life! But for some reason he's stronger than me! Why doesn't my logic ever work?!"

<P>'Hey, Vegeta!' said Goku telepathicly. 'The reason I'm stronger is because I'm pure-hearted. See ya.'

<P>"KAKAROT!!!!!!!!"

<P>It's looks like Vegeta's gonna need lots of chill pills! But is the pure hearted Goku right about the reason? Or is he trying to get Vegeta stronger? Find out next time on Dragonball NR

<P>Next time on Dragonball NR, Goku and the others return to Dende's to continue their training. Meanwhile, Vegeta returns home to Bulma and starts training in the gravity chamber. Up at Dende's, the juniors continue to practice fusing along with Goten and Goku, Gohan, Piccolo, and Trunks have an every man for himself training match.

<P>Previously on Dragonball NR, Goku and the others meet Shinomiya, Minoshiya's stronger twin brother who's there to train help them beat the saiyans. Goku tells Vegeta the reason Goku's always stronger is because he's pure-hearted! But is Goku right? Find out today on Dragonball NR!

<P>"Look," said Trunks,"it's Korin's Tower. We should get some Senzu Beans from him before we go fight the saiyans."

<P>"Right," said Goku. Then they arrived at Dende's Lookout.

<P>"Gohan," said Mr. Popo,"Dende has told me all about the tournament. Congratulations."

<P>"Thanks."

<P>"Dende has also created 3 more Hypervolic Time Chambers in which 3 people can go into."

<P>"Seriously?" asked Goku.

<P>"Yes. I suggest that you start training right away. There's no time to lose."

<P>"Okay," said Gohan. "Dad, you go in with Piccolo and Shinomiya. I'll go in with Goku Jr and Gohan Jr. That leaves Trunks, Goten, and Vegeta Jr in the last one. And Mr. Popo, if Vegeta shows up, he can go in the old one."

<P>"Okay, Gohan." Then they went into their chambers and started training.

<P>Meanwhile, Vegeta had landed at Capsule Corporation and was headed towards the gravity chamber. "Oh, Vegeta!" called a familiar voice. "I've been waiting for you."

<P>"Where have you been?" asked Bulma, coming up behind Vegeta. "Answer me!"

<P>"Leave me alone, woman!"

<P>"Answer me!"

<P>"Shut up right now or I'll blast you into the next dimension! It's not any of your business where I've been!"

<P>"Fine, I'll just shut down the gravity machine then!"

<P>"Alright, I've been at the tournament! Are you happy now?!"

<P>"Satisfied for now."

<P>"Good!" Then Vegeta went off to the gravity chamber.

<P>"That woman is an idiot!"

<P>"I heard that Vegeta!"

<P>"Like I care!"

<P>Meanwhile, in the Time Chambers...

<P>"Gohan, you're not supposed to be in my chamber," said Goku. "You aren't either, Goten. What's going on?" Mr. Popo then opened the door.

<P>"I forgot to mention only 3 people can go through a door, but all the chambers are connected. Bye."

<P>"Cool," said Goten.

<P>"Hey guys," said Trunks. "Do you remember the androids I told you that the saiyans were making? I'm going to leave and go destroy the androids."

<P>"No," said Gohan,"I will. I've reached SS6 and you haven't. You stay here and train."

<P>"Fine." Gohan left.

<P>Back at Capsule Corp, Vegeta was powering up.

<P>"I'll show you Kakarot!" He turned SS6. "Finally, I'm stronger than you Kakarot!"

<P>It looks like Vegeta will be able to lend a strong hand in the battle against the saiyans. But will Gohan be able to destroy the androids before the saiyans activate them? Find out next time on Dragonball NR.

<P>Next time, on Dragonball NR, Gohan flies to the Saiyan Base on his mission to destroy the androids and Goku reveals the secret of the instant transmission. But what's this familiar aura around Shinomiya? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

Episode 11: The Android Mission</H3>

<P>Previously on Dragonball NR, Goku and the others fly to Dende's and find out that Dende made 3 more Hypervolic Time Chambers! They went in there while Vegeta trains in the gravity chamber at Capsule Corp after an arguement with Bulma. In the chamber, Trunks realized that the saiyans still had their androids! So, Gohan is off to destroy them before the saiyans can activate them. Will Gohan get there in time? Find out today on Dragonball NR!

<P>"Haaaaaaaaaaa!" shouted Goku, powering up. "Yaaaaaa!" He turned SS6. So did Trunks and Goten. All the Jrs were at SS4. Vegeta was still continuing his training. Piccolo had become as powerful as a SS5.

<P>Meanwhile, Gohan had arrived at the saiyan base and was hiding in the shadows of the night. He looked in the window of the android building saw no one in there so he snuck in. He saw that the androids hadn't yet been activated so he grabbed them. Gohan heard 2 saiyans coming so he hurried out the door, which slammed behind him. The saiyans ran over to the android building and went inside.

<P>"They're gone!" shouted the first saiyan. "They must've escaped!" shouted the second. "Darn them! Stupid androids!"

<P>An alarm sounded in all of the buildings and Gohan took off towards Dende's as fast as possible.

<P>When Gohan landed, he ran into the chamber to tell the others.

<P>"What?! You brought the androids here!" shouted Goku. "Gohan, what were you thinking?"

<P>"If you'd let me finish, I'd tell you we could take them to Bulma and have her reprogram them."

<P>"Sorry." Then, Goku, Gohan, and Trunks set off for Capsule Corp.

<P>When they landed they found Bulma yelling at Vegeta.

<P>"Don't you dare call me a bitch, you immature psychotic. Oh, hi Goku."

<P>"Bulma, we were wondering if you could reprogram these androids within 5 months?"

<P>"Well, I could only do 2 of them if you wanted them to look different. Is that what you want?"

<P>"Yeah, that would be better. We'll destroy the others. Thanks, bye!"

<P>"Bye Goku."

<P>"See ya, Mom," said Trunks. Then they flew off.

<P>Back in the Time Chamber when Goku, Gohan, and Trunks got back, Goku decided to teach everyone the Instant Transmission.

<P>"First, you have to concentrate on where you want to go. Once you've done that, you just leap into the air and you're there."

<P>Within 5 minutes, everyone could do the Instant Transmission. Everyone continued practicing the Instant Transmission. Vegeta was shocked. He could feel their power levels popping up in different places.

<P>"Arrr! Kakarot must have taught them all that instant transmission thing of his! Wait, since pure-blooded saiyans have the telepathic power I could get him to teach me! Although I don't like being taught things."

<P>'Kakarot, can you hear me? Kakarot?'

<P>'I'm right here, Vegeta, what do you want?'

<P>'Teach me the Instant Transmission, no questions asked!'

<P>'Fine.' And so Goku taught Vegeta the Instant Transmission.
	
<P>It looks like everyone's finishing up their training and honing their skills as best they can. But will their combined powers be enough to stop the saiyans? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

<P>Next time on Dragonball NR, the day of the battle has finally arrived! Goku, Gohan, Vegeta, Trunks, and Goten go to fight the saiyans while Piccolo and the Jrs continue to train. Good luck, but, don't forget about the androids!

Episode 12: The Saiyan Showdown</H3>

<P>Previously, on Dragonball NR, Gohan went back to the saiyan base and stole the androids that the saiyans were making and took them to Bulma. Bulma could only reprogram 2 of the androids and make them look like Gohan and Trunks, so, Goku destroyed the others. Back at the lookout, Goku taught everyone the Instant Transmission including Vegeta. The day of the fight with the saiyans has finally arrived, today on Dragonball NR!

<P>Goku, Gohan, Trunks, and Goten were flying towards the place the saiyans had told them to meet them. Then, Vegeta flew up to meet them. "Hey, Vegeta," asked Goku,"are you still stronger than me?"

<P>"How am I supposed to know?" asked Vegeta. "Oh well, I think I'm stronger. I reached SS6 and-"

<P>"We're here,"said Goku, looking down. "I can see them." They landed.

<P>"We've been training for them!" shouted Vegeta. "They don't look so tough."

<P>"I will destroy them," said Gohan.

<P>'I guess Bulma didn't do as good of a job on the Gohan android as she did on the Trunks one,' thought Goku.

<P>"Heheheh," said Zibbiocho. "Be glad you trained, Prince. You're going to need the help. Your son might've beat me at the tournament, but I'm a lot stronger now."

<P>"Yeah," said another saiyan. "My name's Hadopi and I'm just as strong as him. This is Safropa, Edsio, and Captain Jaspou."

<P>"Prince Vegeta," said Captain Jaspou,"You are ordered to come with us. The remaining members of Lord Frieza's royal family sent out an order to bring you back to Planet Dopski."

<P>"One," said Vegeta,"I no longer work for Frieza. Two, Frieza is dead. Three, we can easily beat you and your men. And four, I don't have any clue where Planet Dopski is, who's on it, and the reason for going there."

<P>"We know you don't work for Frieza!" snapped Safropa. "You used to and we're here to bring you back."

<P>"We also know that Frieza, Koola, and King Cold are dead," said Edsio. "Frieza's son, Glacial, has become the new king. He has a son named Berga who will take over after him."

<P>"And it doesn't matter if you know about Planet Dopski anyways," said Hadopi.

<P>"Are we gonna fight or what?" said Zibbiocho.

<P>"Edsio," said Capt. Jaspou,"you go out first."

<P>"I'll fight him," said Goten. "Bring it on."

<P>Goten and Edsio started fighting. Goten turned SS3 and Edsio did the same. Goten turned SS5. So did Edsio. Goten turned SS6 and Edsio was speechless. Goten started pounding on Edsio. Goten started preparing a Kamehameha. But Edsio shouted,"Sio Blast!" and fired a blast towards Goten. He dodged it fired his blast which finished Edsio. Goten landed with a smirk on his face.

<P>"Congratulations," said Capt. Jaspou. "I didn't think you'd beat the weakest member of my group that fast. Safropa, your turn."

<P>The Android Gohan stepped out to meet Safropa. Safropa turned SS5. AGohan went out to fight her. "Turn Super Saiyan!" shouted Goku. AGohan did nothing. Safropa then easily destroyed AGohan. Then, the real Gohan came out from behind a cliff and in the smoke, got rid of AGohan and stood in it's place. Then, the real Gohan turned SS6.

<P>Well, it looks like Gohan has been able to trick the saiyans with his android. But will Trunks be able to do the same? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

<P>Next time on Dragonball NR, the battle with the saiyans continues as Gohan beats up Safropa. Captain Jaspou's getting impatient and demands to start another battle.

Goten easily beat Edsio, the weakest saiyan, and then the Android Gohan stepped forward to fight Safropa. AGohan got destroyed and the real Gohan took his place. Gohan is fighting Safropa. But can he win? Find out today on Dragonball NR!

<P>Gohan started walking towards Safropa. Safropa started powering up. Gohan engaged in battle with Safropa. Safropa couldn't block hardly any of Gohan's punches. Gohan knocked Safropa to the ground and fired numerous blasts at her. Then, an explosion came from behind Gohan. Everyone turned towards it. AGohan came out of the rubble. "What?!" shouted Gohan.

<P>"So you're the ones who stole our androids!" shouted Capt. Jaspou. "Zibbiocho, destroy it!" No one even bothered to try to stop Zibbiocho.

<P>"Hold it right there!" shouted ATrunks. "No one destroys my friend!" AGohan was already gone, but Bulma had programmed the androids to stick up for each other. "Battle him!" shouted Capt. Jaspou.

<P>ATrunks engaged in battle with Zibbiocho while Gohan continued fighting Safropa. Gohan beat Safropa into the ground again and fired a Masenkos at Safropa almost killing her. "Safropa! How could you let him beat you?" shouted Capt. Jaspou. "Die!" He fired a blast killing Safropa.

<P>"You and Vegeta are truly alike," said Gohan, looking at Jaspou. "When Vegeta came to Earth, he destroyed his partner Nappa when my dad beat him."

<P>"I was wondering what happened to Nappa," replied Jaspou. "Vegeta! Come battle me. Kakarot! Battle with Hadopi!"

<P>"My name is Goku," said Goku. "My name was Kakarot a long time ago."

<P>"Whatever, just fight."

<P>"Fine."

<P>Meanwhile, ATrunks was beating Zibbiocho. They were both SS6, but ATrunks was a stronger SS6. Eventually, ATrunks destroyed Zibbiocho with a Burning Attack.

<P>"How can we be losing?!" shouted Jaspou, dodging Vegeta's punch. Jaspou suddenly smiled.

<P>"Don't even try the artificial moonlight trick," said Vegeta. "All of us will transform too."

<P>"Darn."

<P>Capt. Jaspou fired a blast at ATrunks, destroying him, and then the real Trunks came out.

<P>"Evil never learns," said Trunks. Jaspou smiled again. "Oh they don't, do they?"

<P>"Artimoonpower!" shouted Jaspou, firing a blast at Zibbiocho. Zibbiocho got up from the dead and attacked Trunks, who went into combat with him.

<P>"KAMEHAMEHA!" shouted Goku, firing his blast at Hadopi. "NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!" screamed Hadopi, as his body was reduced to nothing.

<P>Trunks finished off Zibbiocho with a Burning Attack.

<P>"Get ready, Jaspou," said all the saiyans together,"you're next."

<P>It looks like our heroes are winning! But what is Jaspou's true power like? And will our heroes be able to withstand it? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

Episode 14: Making a Safe Planet</H3>

<P>Previously on Dragonball NR, the real Gohan began fighting Safropa but then AGohan came out of the rubble. Zibbiocho destroyed AGohan and then ATrunks destroyed Zibbiocho. The real Gohan continued his fight with Safropa and then killed her. Capt. Jaspou destroyed ATrunks and then revived Zibbiocho. The real Trunks came out and killed Zibbiocho while Goku killed Hadopi with his Kamehameha. Now, all the Z fighters have their eyes set on Jaspou, the leader of the enemies. Plus, there's some crazy fusing going on. Will their combined strength be enough to defeat Jaspou? Find out today on Dragonball NR!

<P>Jaspou began powering up. He turned SS6 and attacked Vegeta. Vegeta turned SS6 also. Goku, Gohan, Goten, and Trunks turned SS6 and attacked Jaspou.

<P>"Back off," barked Vegeta. "I can take him." Then Vegeta turned Super Saiyan Level 7.

<P>"Why didn't you tell us?" asked Goku.

<P>"I was going to, but I got interupted."

<P>"Guys, let's join him!" Everyone turned SS7; including Jaspou.

<P>Just then, Piccolo, Shinomiya, and the Jrs landed. But the Jrs were one. They had fused together!

<P>"I'm Gohuta Jr," said the Jrs. Gohuta Jr was at SS6! Shinomiya and Piccolo were just as strong as Gohuta Jr.

<P>Then, Goten and Trunks fused into Gotenks. Goku and Vegeta fused into Vegetto. Then, Vegetto and Gotenks fused into Vegetenks!? Gohuta Jr and Vegetenks fused into Gohuvegetenks Jr!?!?!?! And then Gohan, feeling left out, fused with them. They became the Ultimate Saiyan! They were SS8, just like Jaspou!

<P>"I will destroy you," said the Ultimate Saiyan. "I'm going to put an end to your life for good."

<P>"Fusing isn't everything," said Jaspou.

<P>"But paying attention is!" shouted Piccolo, coming up behind Jaspou and knocking him to the ground.

<P>"Thanks," said Ultimate,"but stay out of this Piccolo."

<P>Ultimate fired a Kamehameha at Jaspou. Shinomiya began preparing a Mega-Ultra Spirit Bomb.

<P>Jaspou flew back up, his arm limp at his side. Ultimate knocked him back to the ground.

<P>"You don't need to bother with that Spirit Bomb," came Vegeta's voice from Ultimate. "We can handle this." Shinomiya ignored him.

<P>Jaspou fired his Jaspou Blast and Ultimate fired a Kamehameha. The 2 blasts met and neither could overpower the other. Everytime one blast would start to overcome the other it was pushed back to it's normal position.

<P>Piccolo was continually firing blasts at Jaspou, but they hardly had any effect. "I hate Deja Vu!" shouted Piccolo.

<P>"My Mega-Ultra Spirit Bomb is ready!" squealed Shinomiya. "Fire it!" shouted Piccolo. Piccolo fired a Mesenkos at Jaspou to help Shinomiya's Spirit Bomb. All the energy hit Jaspou head on. "NNOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!" screamed Jaspou as he passed into the next dimension.

<P>Ultimate unfused and everyone was thrown to the ground except Vegeta. "Vegeta," said Goku,"you owe someone an apology."

<P>"Aw, for pete's sake! Sorry!" spat Vegeta.

<P>And living returned to normal for the Z fighters.

<P>Next time on Dragonball NR, the last survivor of an old, almost annihilated race comes to Earth to get his revenge against Vegeta. Who is this new foe and is he a threat to the Earth? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!
