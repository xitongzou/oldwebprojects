<P><EM>Disclaimer:</EM>
<P>I know I forgot to put a disclaimer in the last chapter, but it was just a mistake. Well anyway, I don't own DBZ in any matter, and every character who appears in this saga, except for Vaglare, Lindrana, Scorchland, and Blizzard, are the creation of Akira Toriyama. Bare with me, I'm sort of a good writer.

By SSJ6 Vaglare<BR><BR>
Part 1</H3>
 
<P>"I'll get you now Kakarot!" screamed SSJ2 Vegeta as he fought with SSJ3 Goku. It had been several months since Majin Buu was defeated and Goku had taken time off training Goten to spar with his old rival, Vegeta. Gohan, Trunks, and Goten had been watching their fathers fight. 
 
<P>When Trunks saw Goku knee Vegeta into a rock, he turned his best friend, Goten and said, "Goten, you're so lucky. You have a big brother but, I don't have one. I really wish I had a big brother, especially if he was really kind..." 
 
<P>Gohan sighed and said, "I wish I had a really good best friend who fight as good as I can. I wouldn't care if he was better than me!" Little did Trunks and Gohan know that their wishes were going to be granted soon.  
 
<P>Goku was about to throw his kamamaha when King Kai called in his head, "Goku! Stop this fighting because you have to save the Earth from Prince Blizzard! He's Freeza's son and wants revenge on all saiyans for the death of his father. He's so cruel, he wouldn't care if he destroyed half the galaxy." After Goku explained what was going on, he and the other four blasted off to stop Blizzard.
 
<P>"Soon, all will fear the wrath of Prince Blizzard!" laughed Blizzard as he waved his metallic right arm and buildings fell like dominoes. Years ago, Blizzard had lost his right arm in a battle and was given a synthetic one to replace it. "Hmm...five great powers coming towards this field. Could one of them be...no, none of are as strong as he is. Oh well, it'll be fun to toy with them...then kill them!" laughed Blizzard again.
  
<P>Meanwhile, miles away, a young saiyan man had been standing on a cliff, waiting for the right time to reveal himself. He was sixteen years old and was a little taller than Gohan. The young man's hair was brown, his eyes were blue, and a beautiful sword was in a scabbard, hung across his shoulders and along his back. 
 
<P>"Time to reveal myself, time to reveal my great power...time to reveal the truth about the saiyan royal line" thought the saiyan teenager to himself before he powered up to SSJ2 and blasted off, hoping to defeat Blizzard and save the Earth.

Part 2</H3>

<P>"KAAAAAAMAAAAHHHHMMMMMAAAHAAA!" yelled SSJ3 Goku firing his most powerful beam at Blizzard, but the tryant just laughed and overpowered Goku's attack with his own. Before he knew it, Goku was on the ground, and was no longer a super saiyan 3. SSJ2 Vegeta and SSJ2 Gohan tried to attack to together, but in a few moments, they were next to Goku. Finally, Trunks and Goten fused into SSJ3 Gotenks and gave Blizzard a blow to his gut. He then threw a knee to Blizzard's face, followed by a ki blast. 

<P>"Face it, you loser! You're no match for me!" laughed the cocky Gotenks in Trunks's and Goten's voices. Suddenly, the whole area shook and when the dust cleared, Blizzard had transformed into an even more powerful beast.

<P>"What was that you were saying, fusion?" asked Blizzard before he slammed Gotenks into a building, followed by a barage of ki basts, causing great pain to the fusion. In a few moments, Blizzard had Gotenks in a bear hug and was laughing evily. Suddenly, out of nowhere, someone had snuck up on Blizzard and kicked him hard in the back, causing to release Gotenks and fall to the ground. When Trunks had split with Goten, he saw the one who had saved them was a SSJ2 teenager.
 
<P>"Are you two okay?" asked the SSJ2 as he gave them senzu beans and smiled, showing a look that revealed he was a good guy. 

<P>Blizzard arose the rubble and said to himself, "There's only one wretched being I know who could take me with a back kick." He then turned to the three saiyans and yelled, "So Prince Vaglare, we meet again! I'll still get revenge on you for slicing off my arm!" Vegeta's face looked shocked when he heard this as he looked at the SSJ2 teenager.

<P>Vaglare just gave a confident look as he said, "I see you still call people with their titles." He then turned to Vegeta and said, "I know what you're thinking and your guess is right...Dad." Everyone became shocked upon  hearing this, except for Blizzard who was charging at Vaglare. Suddenly, two ki blasts stop him in his tracks and two beings land, one looks like a beautiful teenage girl and the other likes a half-man, half-dragon in knight armor. "Lindrana! Scorchland! You two give the others these senzu while I take care of Blizzard!" 
 
<P>"Thou's wish shall be fufilled, lord Vaglare!" said Scorchland as he took the bag from Vaglare and flew off to the others. Lindrana followed him as Vaglare flew to the top of a building and began to power up. His golden hair grew to his waist and his eyebrows disappeared, effects of becoming SSJ3. Vaglare's muscles grew in size and his power was great.

Part 3</H3>

<P>SSJ3 Vaglare and Blizzard rolled across the ground, exchanging punches. However, Vaglare was much stronger and easily pulrized Blizzard. After Blizzard was kicked in the mouth and roundhoused, he yelled, "NOW I'M MAD!" He flew high in the air and yelled, "EARTH TEARING LASER!" firing a beam of blackish-energy at Vaglare.

<P>Vaglare drew his sword and yelled, "PHOENIX BEAM!" unleashing a red beam that met with Blizzard's laser. After using much of his strength, Vaglare finally overpowered Blizzard and the villanous changeling was no more. 

<P>As Trunks watched Vaglare land and turn back to a normal saiyan, he thought to himself, "If Vaglare is dad's son too, then I have finally a big brother!" and he gave out a smile.

<P>Gohan noticed Vaglare was a little exhausted, and as he helped him stand, he said, "Man, you're strong, even tougher than my father." Vaglare let out a half smile, and it became obivious, that a new freindship had formed.
