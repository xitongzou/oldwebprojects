Chapter 1: Frequently Asked Questions
=============

 --------------------------------------------------------------------
| Read these following Frequently Asked Questions before asking me a |
| question via E-Mail.								   |
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

Q) Where are all the Djinn?
A) See the Djinn section or search for a particular Djinn name in the
walkthrough by pressing Control + F on a PC.

Q) What are those numbers in parentheses after "go back from whence you came."
A) These numbers are some stupid joke that the author of the FAQ through in
that count the number of times up until then that he has used that phrase. 
Anyone else notice I'm talking in the third person point of view?

Q) Can I get back to Vale, Vault, etc. later in the game?
A) Yes, look at the section Vale...again and a few of the sections before it.

Q) What do I do with Game Tickets and Lucky Medals?
A) Game Tickets are used for a game in Tolbi.  The game is one of the ones near
the fountain, I believe.  Lucky Medals are also used in Tolbi in the fountain
coin throwing game.

Q) I have a question not answered here.  How can I ask one?
A) E-mail me at gsa@comicsoft.zzn.com

Q) How do you get those nuts in the trees?
A) Thanks to Jagoros@tricorpgames.com for this information: Use the Catch
Psynergy on the trees that contain nuts in order to get them.  Nuts are quite
helpful in the early part of the game.

Q) Who is Robin?
A) The default Japanese name for the main character.

Q) How do I Mind Read the monk?  Whenever I go up to him and want to bring up
my menu I just talk to him.
A) Press Select or set Mind Read as a hot key button.

Q) Where do I get the Cloak Ball?
A) It's on Babi's Desk next to his bed.  You can get this after you talk to him
after winning Collosso.

Q) What things do I need before entering Crossbone Island?
A) You need the Cloakball that you find on the desk of Babi in Tolbi, the Halt
Gem (not required) that you find in Vale, and the Carry Psynergy that you get
by equipping the Carry Stone that you find in Venus Lighthouse.

Q) What level do your characters learn their last spells?
A) Somewhere around 54 if you're at the right classes.  Look for an in-depth
FAQ on Class Changes for more information.

Q) How do I get the pink tornado that goes to Crossbone Island back if I
accidently use Douse on it?
A) You have to head out of Suhulla, and when you re-enter it will be back.

Q) Is there any advantage to going to Crossbone Island from the ship to Tolbi
Docks?
A) No, you can't go very far in there without Cloak, Carry and Halt.

Q) I heard this code that if you tap the R button 3 times then the B button 7
times finally the A button 5 times and you'll hear a click and all of your
characters have infinite PP.  Where do I do this?
A) This code is BS and doesn't work.  However, there are a few Game Shark codes
available at http://www.gameshark.com/gameboyadvance/objects/379896_106.html
that can give you infinite PP, although the game is less fun to play when you
cheat.

Q) What is the correct way to pronounce "Djinn"?
A) Well, Djinn is from, I believe, Arabic and it means Genie.  So, the singular
form of Djinn (Djinni) is Genie, leading me to believe Djinn is pronounced like
the alcoholic drink "Gin."
Here's some updated information from Taz 2012 on the dictionary definition:
jin+ni or jin+nee also djin+ni or djin+ny
(http://www.atomica.com/lookup2/pronkey.html)
n., pl. jinn also djinn (jin http://www.atomica.com/lookup2/pronkey.html).
In Muslim legend, a spirit often capable of assuming human or animal form and
exercising supernatural influence over people.
[Arabic jinn?, demonic, demon, from jinn, demons, from janna, to cover,
conceal.]

Q) Can you give me the Rom of Golden Sun?
A) No, I do not support roms and/or emulation.  Go pay for the game you lousy
cheapskate.

Q) How do I get Growth?
A) Equip 1 Fire Djinni on Isaac or 1 Earth Djinni on Garet to have the spell
growth (see the Leveling and Character Classes Section)

Q) I missed Force!  What do I do?
A) You don't actually need force to accomplish anything in the game.  However,
you do need to enter the cave in Fuschin Temple in order to get the Djinni
Zephyr, and without Force you don't get the Xian side story.  However, if you
don't have force you can still go through Mogall forest, and Garet will kick
the log in Altimer Mines instead of you using Force on the tree stump.  any
ways, if you missed Force, keep going to Kalay, then head north across the
bridge to reach Vault again.  Retrace your steps to Fuschin Temple, and see the
Walkthrough about getting Force.

Q) Is it true that no one really asks these questions, but you like to make it
appear as if people talk to you?
A) Quiet you... plus, this question was actually asked.  Give Kevin Mofo and
e-mail at skafusion0@mac.com for further information.

Q) What is the best way to contact you?
A) The best way to get help is through my forums at
http://www.nin-gaming.com/~comicsoft/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi.  However,
if you want to message me privately, send me an e-mail at
gsa@comicsoft.zzn.com.  Sorry, I am no longer allowing people to Instant
MEssage me.

Q) What exactly does the Mystery Blade do?
A) I don't recommend using the Mystery Blade because it's not very powerful. 
occasionally Mystery Blade will let out Life Nourish which has a chance of
restoring a little bit of health to the character that its equipped on.

Q) I saw this code on the GameFAQ's Message Board:
I don't know if this has been found out yet but I'll tell you how to get her.
In order to get her to join your party you need the cursed emerald necklace. To
get the necklace you need to go to Tolbi springs and win it from the fountain.
I would advise you to get as many lucky medals as possible and save before you
start tossing them. The odds of getting it are probably less then 1%. It took
me about 300-350 tosses(I lost count). When I did win it, the medal bounced 3
times( once of crab and twice of the turtles) and it landed in the middle.
Unfortunately this happened to me before and I didn't get so I'm guessing this
just increased your chances of getting it. Anyway when you get the cursed
emerald necklace, go back to Xian and talk to Feizhi. She will say"Where did
you find my necklace?" Give it to her and then she'll join your party. You have
to alternate between characters since you can only have four at a time. The
best thing about her is she can equip all cursed weapons and she won't be
cursed (with or without the clerics ring)!!!!
A) This is a BS code started by an idiot I don't want to give the credit of
naming.

Q) I'm having trouble getting across the sand waterfalls.  How do I do it?
A) You need to hold the B button (aka run), the direction you're going and up
on the D-Pad.  This should keep you from falling down.

Q) What is the maximum level that you can get to?
A) You can get to Level 99, but I've only heard of anyone getting to this level
with a Gameshark.  In theory you could level up this high, but it's not worth
it because it would take an insane amount of time and you stop learning spells
in the mid-50s.

Q) How do I get the Bastard Sword?
A) You can't get the Bastard Sword as it was changed from its earlier name to
the Bandit's Sword (or maybe the Assassins' Blade.  I've heard two different
accounts).  Plus, you don't want it any ways (in the manual there's a screen
shot of it doing about 7 damage) later in the game.

Q) When I go to load my save, it says "Corrupt Data.  Would you like to save
from the last sanctum?"  What does this mean?
A) This means that somehow the power went out when you were saving the game
(either you turned it off or the batteries ran out.)  Luckily you can still
play (as opposed to other games where all of your data is gone), although you
may be missing some of your items potentially.

Q) When should I turn off my Game Boy Advance to avoid getting a Corrupt Data
save file?
A) I recommend not going for longer than 30 minutes after the light starts
turning red or you risk losing power during a save which could be devastating.

Q) Is it possible to get to Lemuria or Hesperia in this game?
A) No, you'll just have to wait for the sequel ;-[.

Q) When is Golden Sun 2 coming out?
A) It will be out June 2002 in Japan, and will be out by Christmas 2002 in the
United States.

Q) Do you know of any secret codes or secret information on Golden Sun 2?
A) Anything I know is in this FAQ.  I don't hold anything back from the
readers.

Q) How do I go back through Mogall Forest?
A) Sorry, it's not possible to get back through Mogall Forest.  If you want to
get back to the earlier towns you need to make your way to Kalay where you want
to head north.  The bridge broken earlier in the game will be rebuilt and you
will be able to get back to Vault, etc.

Q) How do I get into Collosso Stadium?
A) You first need to save Babi.  See the appropriate section in the Walkthrough
for that information.

Q) How many Djinn can one character hold?
A) Each character can hold a maximum of 7 Djinn each.

Q) Why can't I give a Djinn to another character?  All I get is the option to
trade.
A) You must have a balance in your Djinn.  You can not have more than 1 Djinn
on one character than another.  For example, Isaac can't have 3 Djinn on him
while Garet has only 1 Djinn.

Q) Why are my characters with 0 HP not healing in an inn?
A) Characters with 0 HP have fainted and they need to be revived using the
following methods:
ï Visit a Sanctum
ï Use Water of Life
ï Use a Revive Psynergy or Djinni.

Q) I got to the sign in Altin Peak.  Garet isn't kicking it.  What's up?
A) Garet isn't kicking it probably because you have the Force Gem.  Equip Force
and aim Force at the log.  If you absolutely don't have the Force Gem, try
going as far forward as you can, facing right at the log.  This will most
likely trigger Garet to kick it.  Of course, if you haven't got all of the
Living Statues yet (except the last one), he will not kick it.

Q) I went to Imil before I went to Kolima Forest.  Did I do something wrong?
A) No, Golden Sun is a "non-linear" game, so there are no right or wrong ways
to go.  I just consider Kolima easier than Imil, so my walkthrough went that
way first.  You're free to go as you choose.

Q) What Psynergy does Jenna learn?
A) From BlackMaurderer on my Forums:
Jenna:
Class: Flame User
Flare: starts with
Flare Wall: Level 6
Flare Storm: Level 18

Q) Can I play as Jenna, Felix or Sheba?
A) Not normally, but with a Gameshark you can.  See the following site for more
information:
http://www.reonis.d2g.com/GS/index.htm

Q) How do I un-curse an item?
A) You cannot actually un-curse an item.  However, you can remove the
"sticking" side-effect when you have a cursed weapon equipped by equipping the
Cleric's Ring that's found on the 8th Floor of Crossbone Island.  However, you
will still be cursed and will have to go to a Sanctum to remove the curse.

Q) Can I get more than one Cleric's Ring?
A) No, the whole point of putting cursed items into the game is so that you had
to strategically plan who has what item.  If everyone had the best items, that
wouldn't make for a very non-linear game now would it?

Q) How can I unequip a hotkey for a certain Psynergy?
A) You need to set the Psynergy to an item Psynergy (like Catch Beeds) and then
trade that item to another character to no longer have the hotkey.  Thanks to
Gail Smith [GailSmith@kscable.com] for this information.

Q) How do I get out of Lalivero once I've beaten the Fusion Dragon?
A) You can't get out of Lalivero, sorry.

CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY
============

------
Controls
------
D-Pad: Select choice
Menus/Battle/Conversation:
A: Yes/Confirm/Next
L, R: Next
B: No/Back

Walking:
D-Pad: Move
A: Talk To Someone/In-game Menu
Select: In-game Menu
Start: Pause Menu
L, R: Use preset command
B: Run/Back

Notes: Golden Sun's controls are pretty straightforward and you shouldn't have
any problem with them.

------
Regular Play
------
A good deal of Golden Sun is spent in regular play, where your character is
walking around performing certain tasks within towns, forests or dungeons.  In
regular play, you can talk with different people, use Psynergy that will have
effects on the map (for example: using Move will move a rock out of the way),
and move around accomplishing whatever goal you may need to achieve.  When
you're outside of protected towns or villages, each step you take will have a
small chance of a random enemy coming up, unless that attempt is thwarted by
obtained a feather or something to that extent.

------
World Map
------
The World Map operates much like Regular Play, except there won't be any people
to interact with or villages to explore.  Instead, the World Map (which is
available once the first temple has been beaten) allows a player to move from
one place to another quickly due to the greater scale of movement (you'll
notice that your character is more pixilated because he is zoomed in on more.) 
You will be able to go through trees, but not over water or mountains.  Random
battles occur here, too.

------
Battle Screen
------
The battle screen, like most other RPGs, is a separate screen from the regular
game window where you and your allies fight various enemies that come along. 
You will have the option of picking what attack, item, etc. each character uses
and on who before each round of attack.  Generally your faster characters will
attack first, then the enemy will attack, then your slower characters will
attack.  This cycle is repeated until you or the enemies are dead.  There are
several important things to look out for in the Battle Screen.  Each character
has HP which represents how much health he has left, and PP which represents
how much Psynergy he or she has left.  When HP runs out, that character will
die and can only be brought back by an item that revives, or a Djinn that has a
revive move.  When PP runs out, a character can no longer use Psynergy attacks
with Psynergy requirements greater than what is left.  PP can be restored by
finding energy stones.

------
Villages
------
Inside each village there are several things to look out for.  The first is an
Inn where you can rest for a small charge and replenish all of your party's HP
and PP (note: this doesn't affect passed out characters who have no HP left.) 
To revive a character, cure a poison or a bad spell, look for a Sanctum which
is a building with an old man in it (note: If all of your party members die in
battle, you'll end up in the last one of these you visited.)  For a larger fee
than what you paid in the Inn, you will be able to get treated with the things
listed before.  Other important buildings include the Armor and Weapons shops
where you can buy the latest and greatest attack and defensive boosts for your
characters.  I recommend getting the most expensive weapons and armor that you
can afford for each character in each town, because it is very important.  Also
in each town is a shop where you can buy items, but this is not a very
important shop because you should have plenty of the items that the lady sells
from random battle collections.

------
Djinn
------
These little characters probably made their way into the game thanks to the
success of Nintendo's PokTmon, but they are a very welcome addition.  Djinn are
collected usually by battling them (they usually put up a pretty good fight)
when you encounter them in the wild.  A Djinn has the power to alter a
character's stats, moves and even his or her type.  Djinn are useful because
they expose different abilities in different characters, so mix and match
between characters to find the best combination for your situation.  When Djinn
are on standby, a character can summon an extremely powerful elemental attack
that uses the power of many Djinn's combined to inflict strong blows on the
enemy.  If you fight a Djinn and it runs, head out of the screen and come back
to fight it again.

There are 28 total Djinn located in a variety of places along the map.  Use
this FAQ to find the Djinn as you go along, or in the future use this section
as a stand alone to find where the Djinn are.

And now, Baby M's Djinn Guide (exclusive to this FAQ).  Note, this section is

3. The Guide
Well‡here it is.
Part 1-The Djinn
Djinn are vital to your quest. When I was constantly being wiped out at Venus
Lighthouse, I went back and got all the Djinn I missed. My HP nearly doubled,
my Psynergy was much stronger, and my stats were greater! Don't skip a single
Djinni-you∆ll regret it later if you do! Set and Standby-some of the simplest
yet toughest strategy decisions you∆ll make in your RPG gaming life. To get the
great stats, you must put your Djinn on set. So why, you ask, would you put
them on Standby? The answer is summoning. When you summon, a great being will
come out and make a great attack on your opponent. Your Djinni won∆t be able to
be on Set or Standby after being summoned until it has recovered. Summons can
be anything from the weakest summons (yet still powerful) such as Mars and
Venus to the amazingly powerful wraths of Judgment and Boreas. Experiment a
bit‡and save a lot! ALSO: Save before you try to get a Djinni. Some might run
away!
Earth Djinn
1.) Summon
1 Earth=Venus
2 Earth=Ramses
3 Earth=Cybele
4 Earth=Judgment
2.) Set
Name-Ability-Setting Effects-Location
Flint-Swift Strike-HP+8, PSY+4, ATK+3-When you leave Vale, he∆ll come right up
to you (just walk forward on the world map).
Granite-Reduce Damage-HP+9, DEF+2, AGL+2, LUCK+1-In Kolima Village, you∆ll see
him behind a fence. Walk directly into the back of the house the fence is
connected to (you can∆t see the door, camera angle). Follow that secret passage
and you∆ll come out to him.
Quartz-Revival-HP+10, PSY+3, AGL+3-In Mogall Forest, you∆ll eventually see an
Earth Djinni. There is a puzzle involving moving a rock into a hole, pushing
logs, etc. to get to him.
Vine-Lower Foe∆s Agility-HP+12, PSY+4, DEF+3, LUCK+1-At the end of Lamakan
Desert, go north then left over a bridge to a central island in the middle of a
circle river. Keep walking around and battling here until a Djinni attacks you.
Sap-Steal Enemy HP-HP+10, ATK+3, LUCK+1-Revisit Vault when you have Reveal. Go
up to the bell tower and ring the bell. A Djinni will run to a certain spot. Go
to the west side and climb the stairs. Now go around until you find a dog with
a bunch of tombstones. Use Reveal, and then go into the cave and on the other
side will be the precious Djinni.
Ground-Stun Enemy-???-He∆s above the mudslide at Kalay Docks. To get him,
you∆ll have to sail across the sea to Tolbi, and then walk back (top of sea) to
the docks. You will be only accessible to the mudslide platform, but that∆s all
you need! Grab that Djinni!
Bane-Attacks w/ Venom-???-He∆s in Crossbones Isle Cave. You will need the Cloak
Ball, and several other things. First, go to the place where you got Flash, the
Fire Djinni. Go into the cave, which ends at a pink tornado. Let it suck you
up, it∆ll transport you to an off-map place‡go under the mountains and then
into the gap to get into Crossbones Isle.

you may not be ready for yet!*

CHAPTER 6: WALKTHROUGH
============
------
Introduction
------
The first thing to do in Golden Sun is to name yourself.  The default name is
Isaac, but you may want to change this because it will be the only name you can
change (unless you press select three times to change the names of other party
members.  NEW: (source midgetjackietran) After pushing select three times, push
up, down, up, down, left, right, left, right, up, right, down, left, up, and
select to name Felix, his sister, and the girl that King Babi kidnaps.)

Golden Sun starts off in a small village in Vale.  Dora, your mother, tells you
to get up and that a storm is brewing and a giant boulder will crush you if you
don't make it to the town plaza.  Well, after lots of conversation and cut away
shots, you finally get to command your character.  You're told to get down to
the town plaza in order to escape danger from falling boulders.  Ordinarily,
you would be able to get to the town plaza by just going down the various steps
in Vale.  However, small boulders fall in all of these staircases (jee, what
are the odds?) due to the storm, and prevent you from walking down.  So, head
north a little bit to find your first party member, Garet.  After instructing
him to leave his bags where he's standing so that he won't die, Garet joins
your party and you two are off westward.  Climb the ladder and cross the bridge
westward.  Eventually you'll arrive at the western most part of the town, and
at this point you'll want to pull a U-Turn and start heading southeast.  Before
doing this you'll meet up with a guy who's faking an injury worse than a
Brazilian soccer player (although if you say that he is going to die he will
disappear and actually die.)  He tells you to watch out for some monsters on
the way.

Heading back east you probably will encounter a few monsters, but they're
nothing to worry about at all.  Climbing down a long staircase you'll see a
tragic incident in which a young boy, Felix, is hanging on for dear life to a
small tree stump in a raging river.  The tragic thing about it is that his
relatives are all out of Psynergy and can't help him.  Two sisters will be
deployed for help after everyone is done talking, and, surprise, it's up to you
to go to the town plaza to find someone with enough Psynergy remaining to save
Fenix.  Travel south under the bridge, then take a ladder back up and cross the
same bridge.  Shortly there after you'll arrive in the Town Plaza.  Walk to
some of the men in the southern part of the plaza and one of them will
volunteer to help Felix (the other two will go to help save the town against
the boulder).  Jenna and a muscular dude with some Psynergy left will join you.
 After returning to the house where Felix is drowning, Jenna and her relatives
engage in a conversation.  Right as the muscular guy who's with you goes down
to save Felix, the giant boulder breaks lose and tragically drowns the people
on the dock and Felix.  It's now up to you to go find someone to save everyone
from drowning.  Head back towards the town plaza to discover a man and a woman
talking about the awesome power of Alchemy and how it unleashed the boulder on
the town.  They then battle you.  Don't worry about this one, because you're
meant to lose it (there is no way to win.)  NEW: If you use a Game Shark and
cheat to win the battle, you still will have the same result as if you lose the
battle (like you're supposed to.)  Left for dead, so begins the first part of
Golden Sun (as you'll see by the intro screen appearing.)

Three years later the town is still rebuilding.  In fact, you're patching up
the roof for Dora which results in a really LONG conversation.  Jenna and Garet
arrive and dish their deal about how you've now started to master Psynergy. 
After Garet breaks your roof, you're off to see Kraden in the Western most part
of the town.  On the way you'll meet up with the evil duo you met earlier. 
This time they won't want to fight, but instead will just run off to the
mountains.  Keep going a little further west, and head up the stairs to meet
with Kraden.  He'll ramble for a while about Alchemy and how Saturos and
Menardi seemed to have actually been in the Sanctum before, and eventually give
you a mission: take him the Sol Sanctum up in the mountains.  Once the
conversation is done, head back east back towards the direction of your house. 
Once you get across the bridge, head to the left of the brown sanctum.  A guard
will stop you and tell you that no one is allowed up there.  Simply walk back
that way again and you're on your way to the first dungeon, Sol Sanctum.

------
Sol Sanctum
------

Once you arrive in the Sol Sanctum, head forward until you get to a stepping
stone area over water.  Use the right most path, and once you get near the top,
turn left and then do a U-turn.  Head through the unusually long tunnel and
fend off the easy monsters that will attack you.  Eventually you'll arrive in
another room with stepping stones on it, and head up the middle, arriving on
the other side in the middle path.  Open the treasure chest at the end of the
path and head back.  When you're on the stones again head right, advance in the
pathway.  Use the gem you got from the chest on the statue there to open up a
new path accessible by traveling on the far left stepping stones.  In the next
room you'll find a "dead end" with lots of statues that Kraden doesn't think is
the actual Sol Sanctum.  Obviously this isn't a dead end, so go up to the
statue in the right hallway that has a white dash around it.  Push that statue
to the side and go through the door.  You'll end up in a large chamber with
many different paths.  Head left, then up, then right to the wall, then up to
the wall, then left to the wall, then down to the second narrow path on the
left where you'll want to enter and find a treasure chest with a small gem in
it.  Head back from whence you came (I love saying that) and go up to the
narrow hallway to the left that you skipped earlier.  At the end of the hallway
go through the door to find Kraden talking about using your Psynergy to move
statues across the river.

Go up to a ledge and press A to activate your in-game menu.  Choose the
Psynergy option and then choose Move under Isaac or Garet.  The ledge you want
to go to first is the one on the farthest left.  Move this to reveal a figure
that you will put a gem into.  This opens a path in the door all the way to the
right of the room.  Head to the right to enter the real Sol Sanctum room.  Here
you learn that Saturos and company were here to rob the Sol Sanctum (oh no!) 
Head right to enter the Luna room where Kraden will hang out until you find a
secret passage.  To activate this secret passage, head to the bottom of the
Luna room and up the stairs.  In the first room with the four statues, don't
touch anything because it's a trap.  Instead, go to the left to the sun room. 
Push the two statues at the top corners onto the white squares, then hop into
the center and use your move psynergy to move the big statue into the lighted
area.  Move back to the room on the right and start pushing the statues into
the gray squares.  Once all of the statues are in place, head back down to the
bottom staircase if you want a Psynergy stone that will restore all of your PP
(you may not need this though.)  Then head back from whence you came (how many
times will I say that in this FAQ?) and go back to where Kraden is.  He'll get
very excited and tell you that you need to find something that's changed.  Head
left and observe the crack of light coming from the wall.  Once Kraden's done
talking walk up to it, press A and open up a portal that takes you to the inner
Sol Sanctum.

You'll find yourself on a small blue rock in the middle of a large room. 
Kraden will start talking his head off about the Elemental Stones and you and
Garet will have to go retrieve them.  You'll obtain a bag to place the stones
in.  Now, go to the northeast corner of center rock and hop to the ledge.  Make
your way to the right and eventually down once you can go right no longer. 
You'll end up on an island with a white statue.  Press A when facing it to get
the first stone.  Now, head back up north, and you'll notice that it's now
possible to get to the statue in the northeast corner.  After activating this
one, make your way back to the center island.  Now, use the path leading from
the bottom of the island and SAVE BEFORE YOU GET THIS STONE.  Once you get this
stone get ready for one of the longest conversations of the game.  When Kraden
doesn't tell you to go get another stone, you both look back towards the center
island to find Kraden and Jenna being held hostage by Saturos and company. 
They demand the elemental stars and want you to go get them the last one.  Here
an interesting plot twist develops, where it turns out that Felix is still
alive and was in fact saved by the evil duo.  Garet will give your current
elemental stones to Alex who mysteriously appears on one of the stones. 
Finally you will take command of your character again, and you'll want to save.
 Head back right and to the center island.  Go to the northwest ledge again,
and start heading all the way north.  Once you get all the way north, start
heading to the left until about 3 squares from the Northwest corner where
you'll want to head down and the further left.  Get the last stone and get
ready for more conversations.  This time a giant eyeball who is actually the
protector of the Sol Sanctum appears and starts creating a fierce eruption. 
The gang in the center will take off with Jenna and Kraden as their hostages,
and the "giant eyeball thing" as Garet calls it will transport you back into
the Luna room.  Here you'll want to use your "Retreat" psynergy to get
transported back to the start of the dungeon.  Congratulations, the first
dungeon is complete!

------
Going Away...To Vault
------

Head out and back towards town to find many people gathered near the brown
building worrying that you two might be hurt in the eruption.  You go into the
Sanctum and discover that the Great Healer had a vision from the Giant
Eyball/Protector of the Sol Sanctum.  He says that Vale will be protected, but
a terrible power is coming to ruin Vale's future.  Surprise, surprise, it turns
out that the only ones who can save Vale and the rest of the world's future is
you two.  Once that sequence is complete, there's a going away party for you at
the town gate.  Your Mom, Dora, has Garet's sister give you the item Catch
Beads which allows you to grab items that you couldn't normally get (such as
nuts in the tree or keys beyond a jail cell.)

You're now in the world map.  See the "game play" section for some more
information about the World Map.  Start heading south to find your very first
Djinn, Flint a Venus Djinn, flying around.  He'll come up to you and explain
the advantages of collecting Djinn and exactly what they do.  He'll teach you
the basics of using Djinn in battle, so pay attention if it's your first time
playing.  Once that's all finished, make your way along the dirt path, heading
southeast to the town of Vault.  Before you can enter the town, you'll see
Master Hammet, the greatest merchant of all time, leaving the town in his group
of covered wagons.  He'll talk about how Ivan is responsible for his rod
getting stolen, and how he has Psynergy that he'll need to retrieve it. 
Getting scared by a falling rock, he eventually ends up heading north to Lupna.
 Now you'll find yourself in the town of...

------
Vault
------

Note: There is a Djinn in vault in the trees.  It may look like there's a way
to get this Djinn, but there is no way (at this time.)  Keep playing the game
until you finally come to Vault...Again where you will have the skills
necessary to get this Djinn.

The first thing that you want to do in any town is head to the inn.  Here, for
a small fee, you can get all of your characters' health and psynergy points
completely restored.  Next, head to the weapons shop in the northeastern part
of town and buy the best weapons and armor upgrades that are available (you'll
want to do this routine at every town.)  Now it's time to find Ivan, the one
that Master Hammet said lost his rod.  Head to the house on the hill in the
northwest part of the town.  In the northwest corner of the house stands Ivan. 
Talk with him and he'll start to read your mind.  You tell him about psynergy
and the works, and decide that you can use his Mind Read to find who stole the
rod.  Ivan will then join your party, and you're off to the inn in the south
part of town.  If you talk with the people in the downstairs floor of the inn
you'll discover that the two people upstairs were gone during volcanic eruption
at the Sol Sanctum.  So, head upstairs to find the two men with incredibly bad
Beatles-esque haircuts.  They'll be scared of you, and no matter how hard you
try you won't be able to corner one of them to mind read them.  So, leave the
room and Ivan will suggest that you split up to corner them.  You and Ivan will
now easily corner one of them and he'll read the criminal's mind.  You end up
outside of their room and Ivan concludes that the people upstairs are the
criminals.  He also reveals that the stolen goods are somewhere in the inn. 
Head outside the inn and climb up the ladder going up to the roof of the inn. 
Walk over the hole in the roof to fall into the hidden cellar where the
criminals are hiding the stolen goods!   Use your psynergy to move the large
box blocking the door, then jump across the gap and go into the room.  Talk to
the kid tied up to have the three bandits come in and start talking about
Lupna.  To keep you from "ratting" them out, the criminals attack you.  Get
ready for your first boss fight of the game!

These guys are very easy to beat.  Have Ivan and Garet use their Psynergy on
them, while Isaac uses Flint's attack and the Mercury Summon them.  You
shouldn't even have to use any health boosting substances to defeat these easy
evil do-ers.  Now the mayor will come and get back his stolen Precious Urn. 
Ivan also finds Master Hammet's stolen rod in one of the chests.  Climb back
out of the cellar and head back to the house where you found Ivan at (it's in
the Northwestern part of town up on a hill.)  The Mayor will give you some
Water of Life that can revive a downed character.  Before you leave town, stop
back at the inn to get your HP and PP recovered once more.

------
On The Road To Bilibin
------

Note: If you have not yet completed your tasks in Vault, you will not be able
to pass through the cave because Ivan won't follow you up there.  Please see
the section above for more information.

From Vault you want to head east.  Keep heading east until you cross the
bridge, and from there you want to start heading north.  Keep progressing this
way until you find a cave entrance.  Make your way up the ladders until you get
to a gap with a tree stump covered by leaves.  Your psynergy isn't going to
help you for this one, so try jumping over.  When you try this, Garet comes out
and tells you that your Psynergy isn't going to work.  By totally random
coincidence here comes Ivan who will blow the leaves off of the stump thanks to
his new rod.  He now wants to join your quest, and you're back in command. 
Now, move the stump, jump across and use Ivan's Whirlwind psynergy to clear the
leaves at the gate to get in the cave.

In this cave you'll find a lot of ghosts and skeletons which aren't too tough. 
Primarily, you should use group attacking Psynergy that hits multiple enemies
at once (like Ivan's lightening attack.)  Inside the cave head up until you get
to a stopping point (as in a cave wall.)  Hop over the stepping stone there and
head down.  Next, head up the stairs and through the door.  Head down the
stairs and to the right.  Here you'll see a traveler on the ground a Djinn on a
ledge.  Push the wood tree stump as high as it goes and so that it's in the
middle of the two ledges.  Now, head back from whence you came (3), but instead
of going back up the staircases, head south and hop across a small stream. 
Continue along the path going through the various doorways.  Eventually you'll
get to a stepping stone that you'll want to hop across and to the other side. 
Go up the staircases and start ledge hopping.  When you arrive at a ledge with
a large tree stump, use Move to push it to the right.  Hop onto this ledge then
the ledge to the south, then Move the stump back to the left.  Hop over and
then over and to the right to obtain the treasure chest.  Make your way back
from whence you came (up to 4) and get back to the ledge surrounded by water. 
Go to the stepping stone to the right of the stairs, hop across and go up the
stairs there.  From here jump across the stump that you placed earlier to get a
battle the Mars Djinn on the ledge.  This Djinn is harder than your normal
enemy, but he's not too tough.  Use your existing Djinn on him, and also use
your lone summon plus Psynergy attacks to beat him pretty Handily.  Once he's
defeated you will obtain this Mars Djinn, Forge.  Head back to the ledge with
the staircases and proceed upwards.  You'll see a stump blocking the ledge that
you have to hop to, so use Move to push that into the water.  Hop across, go up
and across the bridge and at the end of the hallway you'll be out of the
tunnel.  3 seconds of moving right later and you'll be in...

------
Bilibin
------

When you first enter this town you'll find a tree that looks like a man and is
spooking everyone in the town out.  Well, the deal about the tree is that it
was cursed by the big, evil, dieing tree in the forest that you'll travel to
later.  Head into the Inn to restore all your stats, then to the weapons shop
not too far from there.  If you were clever you would have noticed that there's
a statue in the center of town that you can move.  This statue leads to an
underground tunnel.  However, you're not going to be able to get the Djinn down
there by this entrance.  Instead, head to the Northeastern part of town and
take a walk on the wooden logs that make up the fence of the town.  Make your
way all the way to the western part of the town and whirlwind a leaf covered
entrance.  Go down the ladder, and move the statue back using Psynergy, then
hop across and press A to the Djinn to get it (no battle required this time.) 
You now have the wind Djinn, Gust.

Come back all the way from whence you came (5) and proceed to the north part of
town.  Go up the large stairs and arrive at the town castle.  Talk to the guard
on the left and he'll let you in.  Keep heading forward to arrive at Lord
McCoy's chambers.  He'll offer you the key to get past the Barricade he set up
to block passengers from going to Kolima forest, but then he decides that he
doesn't want to send warriors so young to their "deaths" so he retracts his
offer.  However, thanks to another guard leaking some information you discover
that the barricade was very hastily built.  Head out of town and you're now on
your way to Kolima forest.

------
To Kolima/Forest
------

Head southeast until you get to the Barricade.  Here, go up to the box on the
far left and use your Move psynergy.  Tada!  The Barricade has been broken, and
you're now off Northeast to Kolima.

At this point you have a few options in the game.  You can go either to the
town of Kolima, to Kolima Forest, or to Imil to the north.  This guide
recommends you go to Kolima first to obtain the Djinn there and then to Kolima
Forest because it will be much easier than Imil.

Kolima, as it turns out, has been completely turned into a log-person town. 
The opening cinematic shows how the people of Kolima were turned into
log-people, and explains the instinctive Psynergy that occurs only when it's
needed and can't be controlled.  After the particularly long and dull
explanation, you can start exploring Kolima.  However, the only way to figure
out what's going on in Kolima is Ivan's handy mind-read function, but it really
isn't too useful.  in fact, the only thing to do in Kolima right now is head to
the eastern part of town where there is a Tree-House with a Djinn surrounded by
a fence.  Go in the non-visible door in the back of the Tree-House and travel
around the especially long basement to end up in fenced-in area.  Here you will
obtain an Earth Djinn, Granite without a battle.  Head back form whence you
came (5) and out of the town completely.

------
Kolima Forest
------

Kolima forest is not a long walk away from Kolima.  Head northwest and you'll
see on the map a forest with a gold entrance to it.  Go up to it and prepare to
enter Kolima forest.  The enemies in Kolima forest will start to become more
plentiful and a little more difficult than usual.  They're still nothing to be
afraid of, but make sure that you don't run out of PP on Isaac and get left
without a heal.

Head due north to get to the first easy puzzle of Kolima forest.  Head
northeast and go across the river using the log path that's already there. 
Head west, push the log that's in your way west and then go around it to the
north.  Keep going west until you get to the next screen.  Here you want to
head south and then west, pushing the log in your way to the left.  Keep
heading north along that trail until the path pulls a U-turn that will take you
to the next stage.  On the next screen, hang to the right and go up.  Push the
vertical log towards the west, then head north around all the stumps.  Push the
horizontal log down, then the vertical log east, then go down to the log on the
bottom and push that one down.  Push the horizontal log above it back up, and
then push the vertical log all the way back to the west.  This will place the
log in the water, so jump across it.  Head up the stairs and to the east to get
to the next stage.  This next screen is a little tricky, but at least there
aren't any monsters on it.  Go east until you see a switch that a sign says do
not touch.  Obviously you have to switch that, so press A when you're next to
it to lower the water level.  Now, head down the stairs and push the topmost
vertical log to the left.  Go back to the switch and hit it again to fill up
the water level, then hop across the logs to get to the ledge on the other
side.

On the next screen you will find Tret and his lady counterpart.  Head over to
the east to find Tret, and climb the vine on the front of him to enter in the
door above his head.  The main objective of the Tret "Dungeon" is to get to the
top floor where you will then proceed to fall down on a leaf in the middle, and
continue to fall through those open holes in the middle of each screen to reach
the basement where Tret is.  So, when you first enter the tree give it a nice
save incase you die later on.  Now, head to the right, then proceed north and
then to the left.  Climb the vine to reach the next floor.  On this floor, head
all the way to the bottom most part of the ledge.  Now, jump across the three
leaves on the bottom to reach the other side.  Note: jumping back over a leaf
you've already jumped on means falling down at least 1 floor.  Head out the
door on the right to end up in one of Tret's branches.  Head east without
deviating from the main branch to find a vine to climb up to.  Do so, and then
start heading back west.  Once you're back in the tree, head around the tree
clockwise, until you can reach an inner ledge.  Note: You can jump for the Psy
Crystal at the north part of the screen, but you really shouldn't need it. 
Jump to the leaf and continue north, as you don't especially need the treasure
chest (it contains a healing ring that will restore 70 HP (thanks to Josh Moore
for that correction) when equipped, although it gets worn out reasonably
quickly.)

On the next floor, head out the bottom door and go east until you get to a
branch which you should climb up.  Follow the branch until you get to the main
one, and here head left just a little and then up the first branch to the
north.  Here you'll find a Djinn that you're going to have to battle, so save
and heal before you fight him.  This guy is a little harder than usual, so make
sure that you keep your health up using herbs and Isaac's Cure Psynergy.  When
you're in the battle, use Flint to his best abilities, also try to summon any
elements that you have.  This Djinn doesn't like to be captured, so unless you
beat him substantially he will run.  If he does run, head back to another
screen and then back to where he was.  He should show up again and you can give
another shot at him.  Once you defeat him you'll get the Jupiter Djinni Breeze.
 Head back into the tree using the main branch to get a treasure chest that has
a nut in it.  Then you'll want to intentionally drop down to the previous
level.  Now that you're on the previous floor, head counter clockwise and out
the door on the left.  Go off the first deviant to the south and up the vine. 
From here, go back east until you get back in the room.  Here, go to the
southern most part of the room and hop to the middle leaf.  Once there, hop one
to the right and then back to the middle leaf to fall down the center and into
the basement.

Now that you're in the basement, it's time to fight Tret.  Save before you do
this and inactivate all your Djinn.  Make sure you have full health, as well. 
Tret has about 350-450 HP, so it's going to take you a few rounds to get him. 
Your best bet is using Summons, then Flint with Isaac, and using Psynergy with
the others.  Tret's attacks aren't too great, so you shouldn't have too much of
a health problem.  Once he's dead Tret will come to, realizing that he
shouldn't have turned people into trees.  However, he no long has the strength
to cure Kolima, so you need to begin a trek to get an item to heal him (more on
that later.)  Once Tret is done talking the talk, use retreat to get to the
entrance of the tree, then use retreat again to end up back at the start of the
forest.

------
Heading North
------

The next village that you'll have to go to is the plague infected Imil.  Head
back west to Bilbin Barricade.  Here you will find several trees scattered. 
Hop up on the stepping stone and use Move to move the trees back to the land. 
You'll get a "Hard Nut" (let's not make any bad jokes about that one ;) which
boosts defense after you complete your tasks in Imil.  Thanks to Thomas Kim
[tdkim@umich.edu] for that information.  First you'll want to head back west to
Bilibin to stop at the inn and heal all of your party members.  Once you're
done, head out of Bilibin and start heading northwest.  You'll cross over a
bridge and have to go due west for a while, fighting a few easy monsters on the
way.  Cross the other bridge and continue along the white dirt path.  Finally
you'll reach the Bilibin Cave entrance.  Hop the waterfall and enter in the
open cave door there.  Head right at the first fork and continue that way until
you can go down the stairs.  Do so and head east through a room with lots of
ice cylinders around (it's getting colder.)  Follow that straight through to
get to the exit door and arrive very close to Imil.  Start traveling north and
then to the west and gradually you'll end up in the town of...

------
Imil
------

Imil is being plagued by a terrible cold, and the only one who can save them is
Mia.  The first house you want to enter is the first one directly ahead of you
when you first enter town.  First, go to the treasure chest and get the empty
bottle.  This is very important for later on!  Now, talk with the old man and
he suddenly becomes very ill (what did you do to him? ;-] )  You're told to go
find Mia right away, so head out and take a rest at the inn.  Hey, Mia can wait
for you to regain health.  Once you're done sleeping, head to the northwest
part of town, go up the stairs and then head south.  Proceed to the church and
talk to the girl near the entrance inside the building.  She'll say that Mia
had just gone back to the old people's home and you must have missed her.  So,
go back to their home to find Mia curing the old man in bed.  Suddenly there's
a flash at the lighthouse and Mia runs off.  Before following her to the
lighthouse, let's get another Djinn!  Go up the bridge in the north part of
town, and go to the stairs on the right.  Right before going down the stairs,
go up and on the snow face the snowman there and move him to the left using
your Psynergy.  Now, go across the bridge to the left, and head down until you
get to the first opening of ice.  Here's the exact movement that you have to do
now: Right, Up, Left, Up, Left, Up, Right, Up, Left, Up, Right, Up and you'll
now find yourself in an ice cave.  You'll automatically slide right up to the
Mars Djinn Fever, and without a battle you've obtained another Djinn!  Head out
of the cave and to towards the graves in the town.  Press A against the
northwest grave to find a Lucky Medal.  Thanks to kent smith
[apocalypse155@hotmail.com] for that information.  Now, head to the east part
of town and leave that way.  Proceed the few steps to the large lighthouse on
the coast.

------
Mercury Lighthouse
------
Go up the stairs and talk to Mia.  Once she's done talking, go up the ledge to
the right of the statue and use Move to move the statue out of the way
revealing a portal.  We now learn that Mia is an adept and part of the Mercury
clan.  Using Ply Mia opens the door and you're now free to follow her.  Go up
to the large lizard blocking Mia's way, press A and get ready for a battle. 
The Lizard Man isn't anything to worry about, he's just a little stronger than
your standard enemy.  Head the either door in the next room, and then the door
in the center in the following room.  Now, jump across the stone directly in
front of you and go up the staircase.  Down the hallway in this room you'll
find Mia who once again has had her path stuck.  Move the statue towards you to
clear the boundary and have Mia join your party!  Here's an interesting note
about Mia: In this lighthouse she has infinite PP so feel free to use her
Psynergy to the fullest extent.  Hop over the statue and proceed to the next
room to find several waterfalls.  Unlike later waterfalls, you can't go through
any of these so just move east and go through the door there.  In this room you
will find a series of pipes that roll just like logs, only this time you'll
want to connect pipes to make water flow.  Move the first vertical pipe that's
in your way right to connect it and start the water flow.  Now move down and
then go down and then up the stair case.  Go down again, and the around
clockwise to another down-and-up staircase.  Go all the way up the right wall
to find yet another down-and-up staircase.  Here you will find a discolored
pipe on your left, so push that to your left.  Go down and then through another
staircase until you can finally go south to a door.  Go directly down, jump the
gap and then stay on the ledge (read: don't go down the ladder.)  Go all the
way around until you get to a statue.  You'll notice a LONG dotted line path
and a square on the other end.  Taking about 57 seconds, push the statue all
the way from where it originally was to the square on the western side.  Once
that's been dong, head back all the way from whence you came (6 I think) and
head down the ladder.  Travel back west once you're down the ladder, through
door, up the ladder and into the next room.  In the next room slide down into
the hole to land in the middle of the room with water surrounding a plank and a
goddess on the wall.  Hop over the goddess and use Mia's Ply Psynergy on her. 
Now, jump back on the square.

Now that you're on this square you have a special power to jump 3 times over
water, and then one last time to a safe place.  So, jump to your right and then
head up the door.  From here go to the right, and using the water hopping
ability you just got, jump over to a ledge and then down into the door.  In
this room there will be three waterfalls.  In this room there will be a
treasure chest in the right corner.  Watch out!  It contains a powerful Mimic! 
If you did get this chest, though, use your powerful one person attacks,
Psynergies and your summons.  While Mimic doesn't attack very hard, he has a
ton of health and has the ability to drain PP from a character.  When you beat
him you'll get a handy Water of Life which will revive fallen characters.  Any
ways, head through the third waterfall by pressing up on it and across the
water to get Psynergy Armor, which you should equip on a character.  Head back
out from whence you came (7) and into the center door.  Hop onto the only
square you can get onto, then move east making sure to end up on another
square.  Head east again, then go north.  Continue along the side wall,
remembering that you have exactly four hops to get where you want to go.  Head
counterclockwise around the corner, and then keep heading south until you reach
a door.  You'll end up to the left of the door where you entered the large room
with all of the hopping.  Head through the door and then through the center
waterfall.  Head straight the next door and into the door to the north.  In
this room go to the northern most horizontal pipe and push that up.  Now, push
the other horizontal pipe up, and then push the vertical pipe to the left. 
This will fill the water up in the other room, allowing you to now hop over the
water using your water hopping ability.  So, go back and hop over and go up the
stairs.  Head up the stairs twice, ignoring the switch.  Head all of the way
along the left wall, and go through the down-then-up staircase.  The objective
of this room is to push the statue with flowing water in the hole below.  Push
the discolored vertical pipe all the way to the left, then move the horizontal
pipe so that the vertical pipe can only move back to the right once.  Do so and
get the water moving the statue in the first out of three directions.  Now,
move the horizontal pipe out of the way and push the vertical pipe all the way
to the right.  Finally, move the pipe back to the left and the statue will be
dropped below onto the floor below.  Head back from whence you came (8) all the
way down the stairs and then push the statue onto the switch.  Now, head
through the open door.  This room will have a series of statues that,
surprise!, have hidden doors behind them.  Head all the way to the right, then
go down the ladder and up the ladder all the way to the right.  Use Move
Psynergy to move the statue here.  Now, jump through the door and push the pipe
into connection to reveal a door in this room.  Head through this door to enter
*another* waterfall room.  Go through the 4th waterfall in this room to find
another Djinn.  This time you're going to have to battle, so save before you
fight it.  Watch out for this Djinn, because he has a very powerful Water of
Life.  Your best strategy is to throw everything you have at him as fast as you
can before he can attack you very much.  Once you beat him you'll get Sleet, a
Wind Djinn.

Now, head to the west and through the door.  Go down the hallway and go to the
next room.  Go down this hallway, and hop the gaps present.  The next room has
still more waterfalls, jeez.  Go in the very last waterfall and go
counterclockwise along the bottom and right walls in the new room you just got
in.  Move the statue using Psynergy, hop across and go up the staircase.  Head
down the hallway, and you'll end up a room or two later in front of a waterfall
with a statue there.  Use Ply on that statue to float up the waterfall and end
up on the top of the statue.  Note: Before going up this waterfall you may want
to level up to around Level 9 or 10 as the upcoming boss is very difficult.

As soon as you can here, save.  You'll also get a handy Psynergy Crystal, so
heal up before you use that.  Jump across the ledges and head up the stairs to
find none other than Saturos, Jenna, Felix, Kraden and the rest.  After some
rambling back and forth Saturos will finally challenge you to a battle. 
Saturos is not going to be a pushover, so you're going to need to work out a
good strategy to beat them.  One good one that I used was to pummel Saturos
with Flint/Summons with Isaac, use regular attacks and occasionally fire
psynergy with Garet, use plasma and occasionally impact with Ivan, and keep
using Ply with Mia.  After a long time, you should be able to "fell" Saturos. 
Remember, his AI is pretty bad and you'll have some luck in keeping characters
alive.

Once you finally defeat Saturos, it's revealed that no, it wasn't a fair battle
and his powers were weekend by the Mercury Tower's strength.  Don't worry, you
don't have to fight him again (yet ;-])  After a particularly long and
repetitive conversation, you'll finally be able to hitch a ride back down the
light house.  Also, Mia will permanently join your party!  So, when you finally
get command of your character again, head west and watch as the elevator comes
back up.  Hop across the stepping stones and onto the elevator that will take
you down to the now overflowing fountain.  This fountain water has the power to
heal whomever it's used on, so the town no longer needs Mia.  The water also
has the power to heal Tret, so go up to the fountain and use your Empty Bottle
item on it to fill it up.  If you do not yet have the empty bottle, exit the
Lighthouse and go to the house with the two sick old people in the southern
part of Imil.  The bottle is located in a chest in the northwest part of that
house.  If you for some reason dropped the empty bottle, I believe you can pick
it up in the "Artifacts" menu in the Item Shop in Imil.  Now that you have
Herme's Water, save your game and head down and out of the Mercury Lighthouse. 
Congratulations, you've now beat this dungeon of sorts!

------
Back To Kolima Forest
------

Head out of the light house and go to Imil.  Heal all of your characters at the
Inn, and if you want to see a little optional story head to the monasteries to
say your good byes to the two children there. Next, head back to Bilibin cave. 
Backtrack your way in the Bilibin cave and head back to Bilibin.  Next, keep
heading east through the barricade and into Kolima forest.  You'll want to head
back to Tret, and if you need help with that refer to the Kolima forest walk
through earlier in this FAQ.  Once you get to Tret talk to him then give him
Hermes' Water that you got from Imil.  Suddenly the forest will light up and
Tret will realize what he's doing.  He will now revive the people of Kolima to
their original state.  The other lady tree will also use her powers to deduce
that the monsters that you fight now were once monsters and that they exist in
more horrible forms elsewhere (who would have figured?)  Once you're back in
command, retreat out of the forest and head to Kolima.  Here you can buy the
latest upgraded weapons and armor, but there's not much else to do in the town.

Now head all the way back west to Bilibin and give Lord McCoy a visit.  The
guards will actually call you "Sir" before arresting you.  Don't worry, though,
you'll just be taken to Lord McCoy.  He'll tell you how he's gracious of you
restoring Kolima to its original state and lets you pick from one of four of
his treasure chests.  Thanks to altrongundamcustom of the GameFAQ's message
boards for this information: The chests contain, from left to right, Vail,
Potion, Psy Crystal, Water of Life.  I for one would take Water of Life because
you'll find it to be a little more useful than a Psy Crystal later in the game.
 Now, exit the city and start heading east once again towards Kolima.  This
time you won't go to Kolima, but instead go well past it.  Follow the dirt path
around until you get to a bridge.  A guard will now open it (he wouldn't open
it if you had gone before).  On the opposite side of the bridge you still want
to continue along the dirt path.

------
Fuschin Temple
------

You'll see Fuschin Temple wedged between two mountains to the north of a dirt
path.  Once you get in, head up the stairs and go into the lone building in
Fuschin Temple.  Use Ivan's Mind Read Psynergy on the main monk there and he'll
talk about you taking a test.  In order to mind read him you have to either set
Mind Read as a hot key (hold L or R when you have it highlighted in the
psynergy menu) or press Select to bring up the in-game menu.  Talk with him
afterwards and he'll tell you to go talk to the monk down in the waterfalls. 
Before, doing that, check around the barrels behind the monk to find a Unicorn
Ring that un dues poison (thanks to Thomas Kim [tdkim@umich.edu] for this
information.)  Do as he says, go down the stairs and hop the stones to talk
with the monk at the waterfalls.  He'll step aside and you'll be able to pass
through the waterfall into the Fuschin Temple Cave.

In this cave there will be logs that you can move to cross water gaps.  Right
as you get in you'll notice a relatively easy treasure chest to get.  However,
this treasure chest is really a trap!  Yes, if you try to open that chest
you'll be attacked by a Mimic.  Where you want to go is on the log to the left
and then advance up to the next screen.  Here you'll have to hop across
different wooden stumps in water.  You'll want to make your way to the western
part of the screen, as you don't really need to go in the doors to the east and
north.  Once you've hopped the hop to the western door, enter it and proceed
north through the hallway until you get to another door.  In this room there's
a "secret path" that you'll need to cross to get force.  However, you won't be
able to get across without guessing and checking until you find the Dragon Eye.

So, instead of taking the secret path, head to the staircase on the left hand
side of the room that's also near the bottom.  Go down this staircase and
you'll arrive in a room with two logs.  Head across the vertical log to the
south to find a treasure chest with an Arctic Blade which can be very useful. 
Now, head back across that log and roll down on the horizontal log that was
near the door.  Go through the door in here.  In this room hug the left wall
and go down until you reach a vertical log.  Take this log across, go north and
then east and down the door.  You'll now find yourself in the starting room,
but this time you'll be all the way to the west.  Take the vertical log east
and enter the door on the other side.  Hug the wall here going down to avoid
taking damage in the spiky rocks.  Here you'll want to take the horizontal log
down, then take the vertical log to the left.  Head down on the ledge below and
take the horizontal log back up.  Hop over the stone from one log to the next
and head east.  Now take the horizontal log that you can now get to all the way
north to get to a new door.  In this room you'll see two horizontal logs in a
row a little north of the door.  Ride this log all the way up to the northern
part of the screen, then take the vertical log there west.  Hop on the
horizontal log and bring that one up, then head all the way around clockwise
hugging the wall and take the horizontal log up.  Head across the stone and
down the stairs to get the dragons eye.  Now, hop north along all of the logs
and then quickly into the next room to the north.  Now you can use your
dragon's eye item you just go on this dragon to light the room.

Along this path you'll find a Djinn that's not very hard to fight and beat. 
It's a Mercury Djinn called Zephyr.  Here's one of the descriptions I got from
macserv@home.com: Hop over the stone from one log to the next and head east. 
To the north you'll find a Mercury djinn, and he wants a fight.  He has some
speed and power, but it's not a very difficult fight.  Once you've beaten
Zephyr, head due south and take the horizontal log all the way north to get to
a new door.  I'll revise this when I have a chance.

Once you've put the dragon's eye in the dragon, start heading back from whence
you came into the room with the three logs.  Head all the way down and across
the small log at the southern part of the screen to get near the entrance. 
Make your way back into the dark room.  Now that the dragon eye has been put in
place, a shadow of a bridge is revealed.  Head 1 square above this bridge in
order to find a path that leads you to a ledge in the northern-middle part of
the room.  Enter it, and continue into the next room.  Here you want to jump
across the water and get the treasure chest.  Held within it is force!

Use retreat to get to the entrance of the waterfall.  From here just backtrack,
go out of the waterfall and up to the temple.  Here the monk will talk to you
about the powers of Force you just got.  It turns out that it will show all of
the monsters in the upcoming forest, and they'll run away from you if they're
seen.  So, Force is basically just a monster repellent.

------
Mogall Forest
------

Note: It is not possible to go back through Mogall Forest.  However, it still
is possible to make your way through Mogall Forest without Force (just follow
the directions to go in this walkthrough.)

No, not Muggles from Harry Pottery but Mogall.  Here you'll see a green monster
climb into a tree.  Use force on this tree to see the Djinn run out to the
south.  On this screen you'll see another big stump, but you don't want to use
force on this or you'll have to fight an Ape.  Push the vertical log to your
right, the horizontal log down, the vertical log back to the left, and then the
horizontal log up.  This will land the horizontal log in the water and you
should jump across it.  Use Force on the stump you're now next to in order to
see the monster escape the east.  Follow him!  Use Force on the western most
stump to see that pesky monster run south, so yet again follow him.  On this
screen head east to arrive at a horizontal log that's being constricted from
moving due to a rock.  Use your Move Psynergy on this rock to push it in a hole
and move the horizontal rock down.  Roll the next horizontal log in your way
down, then move the vertical log to the right.  Move the horizontal log all the
way up, then once again move the vertical log west into the water.  Before you
hop over to the next part, go to the southwest part of the grass section you're
currently on to find a Djinn!  Save before you fight this guy, because you'll
need to battle him.  He's not very tough to beat, so you don't need to worry
too much as long as you have your Djinn inactive before hand to hit him with
summons.  Now, hop across the log and use Force on the stump there.  The
monster will jump across the island gap, but you won't be able to jump across
that.  So, head back from whence you came (9 I think) to the northern part of
the screen.  Walk across the log path that was already there, and go through
some trees to arrive at the big stump.  Force on the stump to have the monster
run off to the west.  Follow him and go through the screen going west.  You'll
now arrive at a place with three stumps.  Here you'll want to use Force on the
middle screen to have the monster run south.

Here is a tip from Benjamin Baker <baker@cms-stl.com>:
"Using Force on the stump on the right will cause an Ape to attack you.
After I used force on the middle stump to cause the monster to run
south, I went ahead and used force on the left stump.  Another monster
came out and ran west.  I followed west and you come to a screen with a
treasure chest on top in the middle, a vertical log and a rock that you
have to use Move on three times, once to push it east, once to push it
north, and then once to push it east again into it's hole.  This allows
the vertical log to be moved out of the way and you can get to the
treasure chest.  It contains the Elven Shirt, which boosts agility.
Defense +22, Agility +49.  It is best to equip it on Ivan, who should
have the highest agility of the group already, so this just makes him
super agile.  Isaac should have the Psynery Armor at this point and
Garet and Mia are left with Adept's Clothes, provided that you are
keeping your characters in the best stuff available.  After getting the
Elven Shirt, there is one one way out, to the east, so go back from
whence you came and you will be back at the three stumps."

Head west and then down the log over water path there.  You'll see a vertical
log blocked by a rock here, so use Move to move the rock into the hole.  Once
you've done this, push the vertical log right and jump across the water to the
island in the middle.  Use force on this stump to have the monster jump across
to the water to the south.  Jump back across to the west and head around the
mini-stumps counter clockwise.  Push the vertical log east, then the horizontal
log south.  Head around counter clockwise again and push the vertical log east
into the water.  Save before you hop across this log, because you're about to
get a boss battle.  Use your Force Psynergy once again to force the monster out
of the stump and to the south.  Follow him and make your way towards the stump
in the middle on the next screen.  When you walk towards the log in the center
you'll see the monster jump to the south.  Follow him, but get ready for his
BIG counterpart to ambush you.

It's now time for a boss battle against Killer Ape.  This guy has a lot of
health, and his attacks aren't too shabby.  The first thing you want to do is
cast all of your summons against him to do a good deal of damage (by now you
should have at least one 3-Summon) to him.  Now, Isaac should also have a nice
new attack called Ragnarok that packs a huge wallop (it's my favorite looking
attack in the game.)  Have Garet use his normal attack (I equipped that Arctic
Blade on him that I liked pretty much for this point in the game), use Ivan's
Plasma and occasionally Impact on Isaac, and keep using Ply with Mia to keep
your other party members alive.  When you beat this Ape you'll get 1500 coins
and Douse Drop that's required much later in the game.  Head south once more to
find yourself out of Mogall forest.  Note: You can't go back through Mogall
forest no matter how hard your try.

Head east and go north over a bridge to reach Xian.

------
Xian
------

Note: If you do not have Force, do not bother about knocking over the log in
Master Feizhi's temple, as you can't do it.  Simply continue along on your
quest, it will not affect your game in the long run.

It may not look like it, but the building just north of you when you enter town
is an inn.  Stop there and heal up all of your characters.  Right away you
should notice a Djinn on a cliff in the eastern part of town.  In order to get
this, you're going to need Frost.  Mia should have this if you equip two
Mercury Djinn on her.  Now, you want to talk to the girl walking back and forth
between the docks and near the cliff.  Where you want her is 1 from the top and
1 from the right in order to be able to jump on the pillar once you freeze it
from one side of the garbage blocking your way to the other.  So freeze it, go
up the stairs and hop over to the eastern cliff.  You won't need to battle this
Mercury Djinn, Mist.  Now, head back across the ice and into the building right
there on the cliff.  Here you'll see a tree stump surrounded by a white line. 
Get *right* up next to that white line without physically touching it and use
force to knock it down.  If you didn't hit the white line the door will open
and out come Feizhi and her father, Master Feizhi, discussing her visions. 
They also mention that Hsu is late and Feizhi will run out to find him.  Now,
Master Feizhi will come over and make you use Force on the log again.  When you
do this Master Feizhi goes into a long conversation about how you use Chi from
your mind (aka Psynergy) instead of Chi from you hand like him.  All of this
doesn't really do anything for you, as you don't get any items or anything
important, but you do get a little more feel for the plot.  Now, head to the
weapons shop in the northwestern part of the town and buy the latest and
greatest weapons.  You're now done in Xian, so head out of town.

------
On The Road Again...
------

The first thing you want to do is to go due north of Xian.  Continue going past
a forest and over a few bridges until you get to a small island.  On just about
all islands like this you'll find Djinn, and this is no exception.  Here you'll
find a Djinn in a random battle, so get ready for a fight.  When you defeat him
you'll get the Mars Djinn, Corona!  Head back south until you get past the
forest area and then head northwest over a bridge to arrive at Alpine Crossing.
 Here Feizhi will meet up with you and will start moaning about how Silk Road
is blocked due to a boulder.  Before heading north, fine a puddle in which
you'll want to use Freeze on (equip only Mercury Djinni on Mia).  Then, you'll
want to use growth (equip a Mars Djinni on Isaac) on the small beanstalk plant
in plain site.  Climb the plant, and slide down the ledge once you get up
there.  Hop across the Ice Pillar and head down the ledge to a treasure chest
that contains Power Bread.  Once you're done that, head north at Altin Crossing
and you'll see the town of Altin.

Note: If you're having trouble going north at Altin Crossing STOP USING THE ROM
AND BUY THE REAL GAME YOU CHEAPSKATE.

------
Altin
------

You arrive in Altin and things are a mess.  The water is overflowing and
flooding most of the homes in the village.  Head west a little and you'll see a
statue that you can move.  Use Move on it to enter a small cave with a treasure
chest in it.  This chest will give you a useful Psy Crystal that you'll want to
hold onto for later.  Head to the inn to rest up, then go down the ladder right
in front of the inn.  Head south to find a Water Monster who's spitting water
into the lake that was once a town.  He'll flee into the cave and you should
follow him.  Go a little north in the cave to find the monster hopping very
slowly up a ledge and to the other part of the cave.  You'll probably want to
save this point and inactivate all of your Djinn.  Hop across the ice and then
slide down the cliff and press A to battle the Living Statue.  These guys are
hard core water, so fire attacks are simply devastating against them.  Like
most of the earlier bosses, he has a lot of health but his attacks aren't all
that powerful.  As always, cast all of your summons against him off the bat,
then hit him with Ragnarok with Isaac, Heat Wave with Garet, Plasma with Ivan
and either attack or Ply with Mia.  Once he's been defeated, you'll obtain a
frost jewel that lets you use Frost when equipped (note: Mia should already
know Frost.  If she doesn't, make sure that you only have Water Djinn on her.) 
Go down the ladder and frost the puddle.  Now, jump across the ice pillar and
go out of the cave.

You'll now notice that the water level is a little lower than it once was, but
it's still not what it should be.  Head to the east part of the town and go
down the two ladders there.  You'll now be able to go into the Mine Shaft
called...

------
Altin Peak
------

To find the first Water Monster in Altin Peak you're going to want to follow
the mine track for several screens.  Eventually you'll arrive at a screen that
has a large lake with another one of those Living Statues there.  In order to
get this guy, you're going to have to take the mine cart, so head around the
bottom and Left walls clockwise to find the mine cart.  However, you'll need to
flip the switch a little east of the mine cart first in order to have the track
go the correct direction to reach this water monster.  After a roller coaster
ride of sorts, you'll end up right next to the Living Statue, so save your game
and inactivate all of your Djinn.  Approach the Living Statue and press A when
next to it to challenge it to a battle.  See above for my strategy to beat this
enemy.  When you beat him you'll get a Vial that restores 500 HP and the water
level will drain a little again.  You'll now want to head back from whence you
came (8) on the mine cart, then go east followed by south towards a ladder and
a door.  There is a treasure chest in this door, but it's blocked by a large
rock that you'll need lift to get past (more on that later.)  Head up the other
ladder, and go clockwise until you get back at the door.  Continue back along
the track until you get to the next screen.  On this screen continue going
along the track until you see a door to the north that you haven't gone in yet.
 Proceed through this door and climb down the ladder in this room.  Go through
the door and head west.  You'll see a train track going south when you get to
the western wall, so go down from there.  Here you'll want to change the switch
to go west as opposed to east, then head north along the train track.  When you
reach the mine cart head in and find yourself across the lake next to a door. 
Proceed through this door.  In this room head west until there's a fork where
you'll want to head south.  In the next room, don't go up the ladder until you
freeze the puddle of water in between two ledges.  Now that you've done that,
head up the ladder and jump over the ice pillar to the other side.  Go through
the door to find a room with a mine cart and a Living Statue visible.  Hrmmm, I
wonder if you'll have to use the mine cart to get this living statue? ;-] 
Climb down the ladder from the ledge you were on and head west.  When you see
another ladder going up to a connecting piece of mine track (it's got jumps on
either end) head north just to the west of this and freeze the puddle there. 
Don't go up that ladder just yet, though.  Instead, go west some more and go up
the ladder there.  Flip the switch from left to right, then go down that ladder
and up the ladder in the middle.  Jump across the ice pillar and hop in the
mine cart.  You'll end up on a ledge northwest of the lake.  Here you should
climb down the ladder, save your game and standby all of your Djinn and get
ready for another Living Statue battle.  See above for strategies.  By this
time you may even be able to beat him in one round ;-].  Now, use retreat and
head out of the cave and stop by the inn and weapons shops.

Now, you want to go to the lowest entrance of the mine and follow the mine
tracks.  When you get to a fork near the beginning of the track, head right and
continue until the track ends a few screens later.  When the track ends, go
clockwise in that room and then head south.  In this part, you'll want to head
east then start heading north.  Keep going along the path to eventually end up
a door that you want to go through.  In this room, you'll see a Djinn on a
ledge.  Let's go get another Djinn!  Go to the eastern part of the room where
you'll see a stump and a puddle of water.  Move the stump one square to the
left and freeze the puddle.  Head north and climb up the ladder.  Change the
switch when you get up there and head south along the mine cart.  Hop across
the ice pillar and stump and into the mine cart.  You'll first go in the
apparent wrong direction off to the right, but hop in the cart again to land
just north of the Djinn.  Head south and prepare for a battle.  By this point
Djinn really shouldn't be posing much of a challenge to you, especially if you
use the right attacks against them.  For example, fire attacks wreck havoc on
this Mercury Djinn, Spiritz.  Now, head back in the mine cart and get out. 
Head west to find a water puddle that, surprise, you'll have to freeze.  Don't
climb up the ladder quite yet, as there's another puddle you have to freeze a
little further west.  Now, go back east and head up the ladder.  Ledge hop and
go through the door.  In this new room, take a left and head south for a long
time until you reach a door.  In this room, go north through a rock filled
tunnel until you find a sign and a dead end.  Read the sign that talks about
falling rocks.  If you didn't have Force by now Garet would get angry and kick
the tree causes a boulder to come after you.  If Garet does not kick down the
log, try using Psynergy on the log, getting as close to it as possible, reading
the sign again, etc.  He will eventually kick it.  If you do have Force, line
up facing the tree stump and use force on it.  A giant rock will fall and
you'll automatically run away.  It will cause a giant hole in the middle of the
rail road tracks.  Climb down the ladder then slide down the mountainside. 
Now, head to the north part of the hole and climb down the broken track as if
it was a ladder.  Head west to find a paved area that apparently was a secret
buried deep beneath the mines.  At this point you'll want to save your game
because it's just about boss time.

It's time to fight the final boss of Altin Peak.  As always put all your Djinn
on standby.  Cast all of your summons against this boss to do a substantial
amount of damage.  Now, use Ragnarok with Isaac, Heat Wave with Garet, Impact
on Garet and Storm Ray with Ivan, and Ply with Mia.  This boss has a really bad
attack and the fear of dieing really shouldn't be there.  On his death you get
2400 coins and a Lucky Medal.  Plus, you'll get a treasure chest behind the
boss that contains the Lifting Gem that lets you lift large rocks in your way. 
Now, use retreat and heal your wounds in the Inn.  If you haven't done so yet,
get the latest weapons and armor from the shops in town.

Once more enter the mine entrance at the lowest possible point.  Go along the
mine tracks until you reach the fork.  Here you'll want to go forward at the
fork, and use the Lift Psynergy that you got from that Lifting Gem on the brown
rock there.  The rock will now hover over your head allowing you to pass to the
door.  In this screen head left, but don't go to the far left unless you're
really interested in getting a Vial behind a statue.  When you head up the
middle path there will be another rock there that, surprise, you have to lift. 
Continue along this path, and the next door you go through will put you back on
the world map, this time near...

------
Lama Temple
------

There's not a lot of things to do in Lama Temple except go up to the main
building in the northwestern part of town.  Before you get there, however,
there's a Psynergy stone that you really don't need but can get if you really
want it.  Walk in the temple to start talking with Master Hama (who is a girl
by the way.)  She apparently has the power of anticipation.  After a lengthy
conversation she'll reveal to you how to make Ivan use reveal (bad pun.) 
Reveal is a very useful tool to find hidden objects, doors and other things in
the game and is required crossing the Lamakan Desert.  During this conversation
Feizhi who was off to find Hsu and the others earlier will pop in and said that
the transfer did work.  Then Master Hama and Feizhi will rush off to Alpine
Crossing where Hsu is trapped.  You'll want to follow them, but before you
leave town jump the small stream to end up on the east part of town.  Use your
new Reveal Psynergy to reveal a chest that contains some Water of Life.

Head directly east of Lama Temple to reach Alpine Crossing and to see the
trapped Hsu.  At first it appears there's no way to get to him besides going
back through Altin, but once again use Reveal to open up a secret door.  Pass
through the small temple to reach the other side.  Go up the rock and use Lift
on it to free Hsu from the boulder.  When you come back later the rocks will
now be cleared and you can freely pass through Alpine Crossing.  Once you save
him you'll end up back in Lama Temple where the characters go on and on and on
about whether or not Master Hama looked at Ivan.  Sheesh, what bad
storytelling.  Leave the Temple Area and head southwest to reach...

------
Lamarkan Desert
------

When you first enter Lamarkan Desert you'll notice something different.  There
is a heat bar on the left, and if it reaches the top you will lose about 1/4 of
your health on all the characters.  To make the heat bar go down, you must find
Oasases which are pulls of water surrounded by a circle of rocks.  In order to
find these pulls of water you'll need to use reveal.  However, some of the
rocks are traps, so use reveal when you're well away from them or you risk
getting sucked into one and fighting a difficult monster.

Head along the path for a while until you reach the first circle of rocks.  Use
reveal on this to reveal a pool of water that you should jump into.  Continue
along the path and at the first branch off go up it to find another rock circle
that has water in it.  Head northwest up the narrow path, and take the eastern
path over the western one.  Don't go in the rock circle at the beginning of
this path because it contains a crab ready to attack you.  Instead, continue
along in that direction to find a rock circle after the path starts heading
north that contains much needed water.  After cooling down, continue up to
reach the next screen.  This screen is much more open than the other screen, so
you have to know which way to go.  Stay south, finding in the first rock group
a treasure box with a potion in it and in the next one a pool of water.  After
cooling down, head north a little and go around the cliff there.  Shortly after
going around that cliff you'll find another pool, this one containing a water
hole.  Just northwest of there is the entrance to the next zone.  However,
don't go there quite yet, as we have a Djinn to get!  Head all of the way north
and the start heading east.  You're not going to be able to get enough water to
sustain yourself, so be prepared to do some healing.  Once you get to the
eastern wall, head one group of stones south then start heading back West. 
You'll see a rock formation that has a full circle with a semi-circle on its
side (it looks like this: c0)  In the small semi-circle you'll find the Jupiter
Djinn Smog, who you'll get without a battle.  Now, start making your way back
north, then keep heading west until you get to the wall where you'll want to
head south.  Once you can move left to the next screen do so, and you'll find
yourself in an area with several sand waterfalls.  Simply run across these sand
waterfalls to the other side and they won't cause much trouble.  Keep your
bearings along that trail until you reach a "dead end" with a sand waterfall
where you'll want to use Reveal to reveal a hidden door to a cave entrance. 
Head around this cave and come out the other side.  Cross the sand waterfalls
and get ready for a tough boss battle.  Here you'll see another "dead end", but
before using reveal save your game!

Now, use reveal on the sand waterfall to expose Manticore, who will scare you
off.  Approach him, press A and get ready for battle.  As always use all of
your summons against him right off the bat to inflict major damage.  You have
to watch out, though, as Manticore attacks twice every turn.  So, you'll
definitely want to just use Ply and Ply
Well with Mia each turn (if you have Wish or Wish Well you will want to use
that instead of Ply and Ply Well).  As always, use Ragnarok with Isaac, use
regular attacks with Garet, and use Plasma and occasionally impact on Isaac
with Ivan.  Manticore has some pretty lethal attacks that pack a whollop even
after the initial attack has been done.  Watch out for his pesky poison and
curse attacks that will take health away from you each time that character
attacks.  If a character is poisoned, have Mia use Cure Poison on him, and use
a healing item or Isaac's heal on that character to keep him alive.  Manticore
has about 1500-1800 HP, so don't expect to beat him in the second round as you
may done with previous bosses.  As long as all of your party members stay alive
you should be able to squeak past Manticore.  When you beat him you'll get a
load of coins, a Psy crystal and you'll be able to pass through the hidden
passage that he was blocking thanks to Reveal.

Head through the tunnel going through the linear path.  Head out of the door to
get back on the world map.  Head due north for a little, then cross a bridge to
reach a small island.  On this island is a new Djinn that you'll encounter in a
random battle.  Defeat him to get Vine, the Venus Djinn.  Now, head south and
cross the bridge going west.  Continue going west until you reach the town of
Kalay.

------
Kalay
------

Kalay is just bustling with tourists who are eager to board the ship at Kalay
Docks that's heading towards Collosso.  Head to the inn and buy the latest
weapons and armor as usual.  Once you're done with that, head to the north part
of the town and up the stairs to reach Lord Hammet's castle.  The guards won't
let you in at first, but the Ivan (remember, he was originally Lord Hammet's
servant) will persuade the guards to let you in.  You then go meet with Lady
Lana and engage in an exciting (sarcasm alert) emotiocon conversation with her.
 She talks about how she can't declare war on Lupna or they will kill Lord
Hammet.  Once she's done talking the talk (which, by the way, will take a very
long time) head out of the castle and down the castle stairs.  Head into the
inn, but instead of taking a rest talk with *everyone* in the inn in all of the
floors of it.  Now, head out of the inn and out of town.  But before you can
leave the tour guide summons everyone up and in a very pointless and very long
conversation the tourists will finally make their way to Kalay Docks where the
ship to Tolbi will be.  Once that's all over, head out of town and start
heading north.

You'll reach the bridge that was broken earlier when Lord Hammet tried to cross
it with his caravan before heading to Lupna.  Now that the bridge is fixed,
freely cross over it and the bridge just north of it to find yourself back in
Vault.  In most of these old towns there are now Djinn to get that you couldn't
get before.

------
Vault...Again
------

Head to the northwestern part of vault and go up the stairs there.  Continue
past the graves and over the bridge.  Keep going counterclockwise until you
reach a large tower where you should climb up.  Ring the bell on this tower to
have the Djinn jump to the ledge to the east.  Now, head clockwise back around
the town until you get to a bunch of graves with a dog near them.  Use reveal
on this area to expose a secret ladder in the middle of the graves that leads
to the Vault caves.  Head down this ladder, and don't fight the treasure chest
that you see immediately because it's actually a Mimic.  Instead, head west and
then north and go through the door.  The next room you'll enter has some water
in it with several underwater doors and ladders.  Head east and then go down
the stairs to find a room with a movable torch.  Move this onto the Flame
square on the ground to open the gate there.  Head through the door to find a
room with a *lot* of water drops in it.  Head north to find a door obstructed
by a group of leaves.  Use Ivan's Whirlwind Psynergy to open up this door.  In
here there's a treasure chest that has an item that will boost your attack when
equipped, which is quite useful.  Head back down and climb down the ladder. 
Freeze all of the water drops here expect for the eastern most drop, then head
back up the ladder.  Hop across all of the ice pillars you just made and enter
the next room.  In this room head down the one ladder and then up the ladder to
the left of it.  Head into the door, then go east a little and up the stairs. 
Flip the switch here to force the water into the room you were just in with the
two ladders.  Head back into the previous room and go down the stairs in the
south part of that room.  Go down the stairs again to find a room with several
torches.  Push the torch that has a flame on it on the flame switch to open the
gate.  Now, go through the gate and through the door.  Take the stairs to the
west and continue south through this room.  You'll now be able to go down the
ladder that once was drowned by water.  Do so and proceed through the door into
the next room.  In here hop over the gap and up the ladder.  Go to the next
room and out the door to find yourself right under the Djinn.  Go up the stairs
to get the Venus Djinn Sap without a battle.  Head back into the cave and use
retreat to go back to the beginning.  Climb up the ladder and then proceed out
of Vault.

------
Bilibin Cave...Again
------

While there are not any Djinni in Bilibin Cave, there is are some useful items.
 Head northeast of Vault to find this cave.  Here's a description from Thomas
Kim [tdkim@umich.edu] on a good way to get a few items:
"Enter the cave from the normal entrance. In the room with ice pillars, use
douse on the fire that's not on a pillar. An ice column should automatically
form. Exit the cave from the entrance you came in, and then take the alternate
entrance (the one after climbing the vine). Where the open treasure chest is,
use Reveal where the suspicious stone formation is and a door will appear. Use
douse on the fire in the next room. Now you should be back in the ice pillar
room. Go left and jump towards the ledge on the left side of the screen and
proceed to the next door. Inside, you will get a water of life and Psy crystal.
If you decide to head back towards the lighthouse, you can get Herme's Water
again. You can use Herme's Water like a potion or sell it for extra cash."
Once you're done with this task, head back towards your home town of Vale
(located to the west incase you forgot.)

------
Vale...Again
------

Yes, there is a Djinn in your home town as well.  However, before you go get
this Djinn go get a power bread that's located in a cave behind the Shop in
town.  You'll need to use Ivan's Whirlwind Psynergy on this (equip just Wind
Djinn on Ivan to get this Psynergy) bush blocking the entrance.  Thanks to
Michael Sutton (suttmi@selwyn.ca) for this tip.

Now, go west from Vault across the bridge, then go north to find yourself back
in Vale.  The Djinn in Vale is in the far western part of town, behind the
fenced in area next to Kraden's house.  So, climb up the staircases then start
making your way west across the bridge.  When you get to the fence next to
Kraden's house you'll notice a large, brown rock.  Guess what, it's time to use
that Lift Psynergy (!)  Lift up the rock and proceed north to the next screen
and then into the cave.

Head north as soon as you get into the cave and you'll notice a circle of
stepping stones on your left.  At first it appears it's impossible to cross
these stepping stones, but a true RPG gamer knows that rarely are there
complete dead ends in RPGs.  So, use your Reveal Psynergy to reveal a hidden
square in the middle and hop across to the other side.  Climb up the ladder and
go through the door.  In this room jump across the stepping stones and hop onto
the platform to the west.  Face the large box and move it into the water to
create a makeshift stepping stone that you can use to jump to the log above
you.  Roll this log all the way east go through the door here.  In this room
take the western path and head north.  Keep following the path all the way
until it gets to a door.  Go through the door and push down the logs on either
side into the river.  Now, slide down the cliff via the indentation on the
western cliff and push the horizontal log north.  It will slide across the two
logs and allow you to hop to the ledge to the north.  Proceed along the hallway
until you get to the next room.  In here you'll see the Djinn you're after. 
There's also another very important item that you'll need to get another Djinn
*much* later in the game, along with this Djinn, the Halt Gem that's in a
treasure just right after you climb the ladder to the north of the door.  Once
you get the gem, head south towards the Djinn who will slide down the cliff. 
Follow him and he will continue to run away.  So, head down the cliff and use
the Halt Psynergy that you get by equipping the Halt Gem on the Djinn.  This
will freeze him in his place, and simply go up to him to get Kite, a Jupiter
Djinn.  Head through the door and continue south eventually getting out of the
cave.

Before you head back to Kalay, take this time to round up any Djinn that you
may have forgotten to get earlier in the game.  If you have all the Djinn, head
back from whence you came (hrmm, I haven't said that in a while... I think it's
9 now) all the way back to Kalay.  When you get back to Kalay heal in the Inn
and then proceed to Kalay Docks which you can get to by simply going around the
south pole of the caves.

------
Kalay Docks
------

Note: If you have not yet talked with the tourists in Kalay and went through
the cut scene with the missing passenger, please go back to Kalay and read the
topic about the tourists in that section.

Second Note: Before going on the ship, I recommend going back and getting all
of the Djinn that you don't have up until this point.  Not only is it more
convenient to get these Djinn now, but you will definitely need a good bit of
Djinn for the boss battle on the ship.  See the previous sections for more
information.

As soon as you reach Kalay Docks Garet will run out and look at the Sea that's
not really an Ocean.  Someone in town will correct him, and so unfolds another
pointless plot development.  Once Garet is done, head into the building
directly north of you.  Talk to the lady at the counter to buy your ticket for
going to Tolbi for 800 coins.  Once you've bought it, head out of the house and
go west to the docks to board your ship.  When you get onto the ship head over
to the captain to find a crew mate and the captain talking about not setting
sail due to monsters.  The captain will come around and decide that the ship
should sail, but a crewman won't agree with him.  You'll notice that he's up to
something as he runs off into the Captain's Quarters.  Follow him and he'll
uneasily sneak back to the top of the ship.  Jee, could he have done something
wrong?  any ways, head into the room at the northern part of the ship and head
to the northern part of that room.  Several warriors /passengers will start to
get impatient about the ship not setting sail and will rush to the captains
quarters to persuade him.  Follow them down and enter the room in the southern
part of the ship.  Climb up the ladder here and talk with the guy blocking your
path.  In this (like always) pointless and dull conversation the captain will
realize that his Anchor Charm is gone.  Also, there will be discussion about
the sea being a dangerous place due to the monsters, and it's going to take
passengers to help row incase some of the rowers get hurt.  Once you get
command back of your character, head out of the room and go to the observation
deck which you can get to by climbing up a ladder in the middle of the ship. 
Press A when you get up on the plank up here to find the Captain's Anchor
Charm.  Now, go back in the Captain's Quarters and give him the charm.  After
doing that it's time for *another* conversation where you'll be volunteered for
helping to protect the rowers down below decks.  Once you're back in command
head to the crew quarters (the room at the top part of the ship) and head down
the *very* hard to see stairs that are directly behind where the tour guide is
standing.  Once the crewman stops talking down here you will finally set sail.

Sailing, at first, is pretty interesting.  It cuts back between the different
people doing different jobs and the actually try to avoid the monsters. 
However, this sequence is going to repeat 3 times, so it starts to get tedious
after a while.  Each time a monster attacks, 1 of the row men will go down and
you'll want to head upstairs and pick a member of the passengers to replace
him.  It really doesn't matter who you pick, although you can actually get to
Crossbone Island as a detour is you pick the following people in this order
(thanks to dbzman@ptd.net):  The lady with the green skirt, then the lady with
the blonde hair and a brown skirt, the old, bad guy, then finally the Merchant
who is not near the staircase.
According to Camelot's Japanese web site, you need to have a "weakness of
power" on the right side of the ship in order to visit the island early.  So,
stick strong people on the left and weak people like the Chef on the right.

The first enemy that you encounter will be three Man O' War squids.  These guys
are basically just normal enemies and you shouldn't have many problems against
them.  Once those squids are defeated, the crewmen will come down and realize
that a rower is unconscious.  So, go upstairs and talk to someone to make them
a replacement.  Pick someone, head downstairs, and get ready for the process of
setting sail to begin again.  The next group of monsters to attack are the
Lizard Monster and two rabid bats.  If you used any summons in the previous
round, walk back and forth along the top part of the rowing deck to get your
Djinn able to set inactive again.  Then, head down and get ready for a battle. 
These guys are a little tougher than regular monsters because that Lizard Man
has a little more HP than usual.  However, one summon should beat them pretty
handily, or just regular attacking.  Now, go replace another oarsmen and get
ready to set sail.  Before you pick a passenger to row, I'd recommend healing
all of your characters.  Once the ship gets sailing again you'll be attacked by
two Man O' Wars and a flying blue bird called a Virago (sort of sounds like
Viagra).  Once again, these enemies are pretty easy.  One summon or just a few
psynergy attacks will take them down pretty handily.  Go replace *another*
crewman and get ready to set sail again.  Suddenly it will be attacked again,
this time by a monster that actually means business.

Here's some information on Krarken from Aditya Durgam [adurgam777@hotmail.com]:
"I have some info on the HP power of Kraken, the water demon you encounter on
your way to Tolbi on the ship. Kraken is the fourth monster/ beast you
encounter while sailing.
-He knows Ply Well, so be carefully.
-He has approx. 2447 HP. It would be best if you used all the appropriate
summons with the respective elemental adept (Thor with Ivan, Judgment with
Isaac, etc.). I works better that way (duh)."

Head up to the deck of the ship to fight Kraken.  However, make sure you're all
healed up and have all of your Djinn inactive for this battle, because you will
probably need them.  Kraken, just like the last boss you faced, will attack
twice each round, so you have to be prepared for taking twice the damage.  Once
you've cast all of your summons, start using Ragnarok with Isaac, Heat Wave
with Garet, Impact on Garet with Ivan, and Ply Well then Wish (get this when
the four water Djinn on her get set after a summon) with Mia.  As long as you
don't let your party members die, you should be able to defeat Kraden without
that much trouble, although he is tough.  When you defeat him you'll be awarded
5200 coins and some Water of Life.  Now, go select another oarsmen and get
ready for the ship to set sail.  This time, though, instead of seeing a
monster, the guy on top of the mast will spot land and you'll arrive at Tolbi.

Once everyone's said thank you and the likes, head off the ship to arrive at
Tolbi Docks.

------
Tolbi Docks
------

There isn't a whole lot to do in Tolbi Docks.  There's a simple puzzle to solve
that involves moving those boxes at the northwestern part of down so that they
allow you to jump from the ledge next to the house to the ledge 4 spaces down. 
When you hop across them and go up you can find a treasure chest that has a
potion.  Now, head out of Tolbi Docks and go into Tolbi.

------
Tolbi
------

Tolbi is a bustling town that's loaded with tourists getting ready for
Collosso, an event sort of like the Roman Gladiator games where warriors battle
one each other in front of crowds of cheering people.  Usually in a town you'd
head for the inn, but because the town is so packed there are no rooms
available for you to sleep!  Instead, head to the weapons and armor shop in the
southwestern part of town to buy the latest upgrades.  Now, remember all of
those game tickets and lucky medals that you go earlier in the game?  It's now
time to cash them in the gambling capital of the world, Tolbi.  Head to the
fountain in the middle of the city and throw in a lucky medal.  If you can get
it to stay in the bulls eye you'll win some handy armor.  Here's a little more
information from Weird Ed [weirded_79@hotmail.com].
"The most imortant (and the hardest to get) is the Grievous Mace, a strong
weapon that both Isaac and Mia can equip. It's not as powerful as the Assassin
Blade, but it's great for Mia (in this point of the game, it's a true
blessing), and it performs a special attack that's very similiar to earthquake
spell.  To get this weapon you should throw your medal in the top-left part of
the fountain, outside the circle... and have luck ^_^.  Other good items are:
the Glittering Tiara, the Guardian Amulet (second blue circle or clear circle,
boosts your defense) and the Battle Gloves (boost attack)."

Next, head to the shop with a die on top of it (that's singular for dice) which
is located in the northeastern part of the town.  In here, talk to the man on
the left to start playing craps.  This game is *insanely* easy to win coins at,
so you shouldn't have any problem scoring a good deal of money if you play it
for a while.  Once you're done there, head for the large stairs located at the
northwestern part of the town.  Two guards will stop you and ask if you've seen
Babi.  They'll go on their way and you should keep going up the stairs to
arrive at Babi's palace.  Head to the door along the north wall that's all the
way on the left to enter a room with a lot of beds.  Talk with the lady at the
desk and she'll get you beds to sleep in, which will restore all your health
and PP just like an inn.  Once she's shown you the beds, simply press A when
facing one of them to go to sleep.  Once you're done sleeping, go out the door
of the room with the beds in it, and go up one of the large staircases on the
left or right.  Head north through the hallway to overhear a conversation
talking about how Lord Babi is somewhere in Altimer Cave, but no one can find
him.  Naturally, it will be up to you to find him, but let's save that for just
a little later.  Now, head out of the castle and go to the second floor of the
inn which is located in the northeastern part of town.  Here you'll see a
Djinn, but we won't get that one quite yet.  First, take you shots at the slot
machine here.  Thanks to AlphabetMan of the GameFAQs.com message boards for

Here's some additional information from Rotevni:  You can also get a Ninja
Hood, and a Burning Axe.  The stuff you get varies depending on how many of the
crabs or turtles you bank off of.
Note: there are other items to get but these are the most valuable ones.  Once
you're done in there, head outside and let's go get that Djinn.  Head south and
out of the gate in town, but don't go out of the city so that the world map
would come up.  Instead, stay very close to the outer cliff of the city and
proceed counterclockwise until you come to a vine.  Use Growth on this and
climb up it.  Once you climb up the vine you'll see a pool of water.  Surprise,
surprise, you have to freeze that puddle of water.  Do so, then head down the
vine and go back into town.  Go up two stairs facing east to find that ice
pillar you made.  Hop across it to get the Mars Djinn Ember without a battle. 
It's now time to exit the town and start looking for Babi in Altimer Caves.

------
To Altimer Caves
------

From Tolbi, start heading northwest along the dirt path.  Eventually you'll
start heading in more of a due north direction, and there will be a bridge
going west.  Take this bridge and run around in this location trying to draw
random battles.  In this forresty area should be a Mercury Djinn.  He's really
not very hard to beat, especially if you've defeated Kraken on the ship. 
Simply use fire attacks with Garet and do what you always do with the other
characters to beat him and get the Mercury Jinn, Hail.  Head back northeast
from this area and across the bridge.  Continue heading east for quite a while
until you see a bridge to the north of you.  Don't go up this bridge quite yet,
because there's another Djinn to get.  Keep going east hugging the coast line
until you get to the Northern Parts of Kalay Docks.  Simply walk down to get
the Venus Djinn Ground without a fight.  Now, head back north to that bridge
and cross it.  Keep heading north until you enter...

------
Altimer Cave
------

Head north along the hallway and notice how the cave starts to get darker. 
This can be a hassle later on when you have to solve moving around rock puzzles
with only a small amount of light.  One way to combat this problem is to use
Reveal which will expose a large area of ground being lit.  any ways, keep
heading along the hallway as it does a U-Turn.  Go through the door when you
get to it to reach a room with several rocks blocking your path.  Use reveal to
get a better view, or simply go left, then up a square, then go to the right,
then up to the stairs.  The next room you enter will have a few lighted spots,
which can be helpful.  Head west in this room and head along the hallway.  At
the fork head left to find an outline of a man.  Talk to him and get very angry
at your stupid party members for not realizing that this invisible man is
actually Babi.  The invisible man talks about how he can't move because he's
out of Draught and it's up to you to go find him some.  He'll go into a really
confusing explanation on how to get the draught from the puzzle below.  Just
disregard it because I'll reveal the information later on ;-].  Once you get
back in command head past the invisible man and go down the staircase there.

Head west and then south along the hallway.  Keep heading along the wall even
though there appears to be a path going north that you can take.  When you get
to a fork head right and when you get to the top wall start heading west.  Go
down the door when you get to it.  Someone let there be light in the next room,
which is quite helpful.  Head down the steps and then up the stairs to the
north to get another Djinn.  Before you get that Djinn, however, you'll have to
solve a log rolling puzzle.  Push the vertical log in your way right, then push
the horizontal log at the bottom north.  Now, freeze that puzzle in the middle
and head around the rocks on the bottom.  Push the vertical log back left. 
Now, you have to push the lower of the two horizontal logs down by going behind
the log that's sticking up on the western part of the screen.  After pushing
this down, push down the top horizontal log and continue on to the Djinn. 
Warning: You will have to battle this Djinn, although it won't be too hard. 
Once you defeat him you'll get the Jupiter Djinn Squall.  Now, head back east. 
Push the logs out of your way so that you can get east and push the wooden
stump into the gap in order to jump across to the ledge and the door. 
Unfortunately, the light that was once there is now gone, and you'll have to
operate in the dark again.  Head south along the hallway and then start heading
west.  Keep heading west until you reach a large wall of rocks.  You can get
through this rock maze by heading south, then head north when you see a rock
break (try using reveal for a better view.)  Head east, and then north when you
get back into the hallway.  Start heading west until you get to a staircase and
go down it.  This next room will be lighted, which is nice, but you do have a
log maze to solve.  Push the first vertical log left, then go southwest until
you find a staircase.  Go up the stairs and head counterclockwise all around
the wall and slide down the cliff.  Push the vertical log to the left and enter
the door.

You'll enter a room with 5 rocks.  Use reveal to find out the colors of them. 
The correct rock that you want is the rock that makes a chime sound when you
press it.  So, press the left most rock, then the right most rock to reveal a
color wheel.  Press the rock that's color is on top of the color wheel three
different times until you solve the puzzle.  The color wheel will pseudo  and
reveal a door.  Enter it and open the treasure chest in it.  Inside of the
treasure chest is, you guessed it, the draught that the invisible man wanted
you to retrieve.  Now, use your Reveal psynergy then go back to the invisible
man.  Talk to him and give him the draught.  He will eagerly drink it and
reveal himself as Babi (didn't guess that one a lot earlier.)  Lots of talk
will ensue about Babi using Lamarkian powers to keep himself alive, and
eventually the guards will come and inform Babi that the finals have begun.  As
he starts to walk off, he'll invite you (as in Isaac alone) to enter in the
finals of Collosso.  Once you finally get command of your character again,
retreat out of the cave and start heading back southwest to Tolbi.

------
Collosso
------

Before I start discussing Collosso, here is how to get the general Psynergies
listed below:
Growth - Equip an Earth Djinn on Garet
Frost - Have only Water Djinn active on Mia.  Also try equipping the Frost Gem.

When you get back to Tolbi, head to the castle which you can get to by going up
the stairs in the northwestern part of the town.  Head into the room with the
beds that, if you remember, you can get to by entering the small door on the
left.  Once you're all rested, head out of the castle and go north up the main
path in the middle of the town.  Here you will reach the stadium.  Head up the
stairs on the right to have the guards recognize you and take you to the
briefing room.  Here you'll be told that only Isaac is entering the finals, and
the rest of your party members can only cheer Isaac on.  However, the other
party members will have important roles.  Before each round begins, there is an
obstacle course that you have to get through quickly in order to get the best
weapon in the center rink.  There are also nuts and oil drops in treasure
chests that you can get that will help you a little in battle.  So, the
characters get to use 1 Psynergy before the match begins and can do useful
things such as grow vines to find shortcuts and freeze ice to hop over easily. 
Once all the guards stop talking in the preparation room you'll be taken to the
stands of Collosso.  He'll explain the rules of the obstacle course.  Now, go
up to the first guard and get him to explain what the first event is like. 
He'll show you a snippet of what the first leg is like, then ask if you want a
friend to cheer you on.  Select Garet for this task.  The next stage you'll
want Mia to go cheer.  The following one you'll want Ivan, but make sure that
he has a growth spell on him.  Take a look at the 4th and final leg of the
course, although you won't need anyone to cheer for you there.  Now, go all the
way back to the guard who's along the south wall.  Talk to him to go back to
the Preparation room.

In this room go over to the circle that's all the way to the right.  Step on it
and watch as the contestants are told that the matches are about to begin. 
Once you leave the preparation room, you'll take command of Garet in the
stands.  Use his Move Psynergy to move the stump to the left.  Have Ivan use
grow on the vine, and have Mia just talk to the guard to say that she's ready
for the match to begin.  Now you will take command of Isaac.  As soon as you
can save your game in case you lose against the competitor you're facing.  In
this first round simply jump over the gap thanks to the stump that Garet moved.
 Right after there you'll see a stump that's in the way of a path.  Move that
to the right and go up to get the treasure chest.  The next leg has a pipe that
you need to push west to make the water flow.  Once you do that, jump across
the gap thanks to the now elevated platform.  Now, go further right and climb
up the vine that Ivan grew.  When you get up here you'll see a path going north
that gets to a treasure chest that you'll want to get.  The next screen has two
logs.  If you just want to get across and don't want to get the nut this is
very simple.  However, if you want to get the nut (I recommend it because the
other guy is slow getting there) take the vertical log right, then go up and
take the horizontal log down.  Get off that and take the vertical log back
left.  Now, climb back up the ladder, take the vertical log right and hopefully
you'll get there before the other player.  If you get there first you'll get
the iron shield which will help in your defense.

Your first enemy will be Azart.  The first thing you'll want to do, like
always, is cast your one and only summon against him.  Judgment will do about
315 damage to him.  Now you'll want to use Ragnarok against him for the next
round.  You'll now be down to about 50 or less HP, so you'll want to use Cure
Well on yourself.  Continue using Ragnarok and Cure Well on him, with the
occasional helpful Djinn if you need it.  After he wastes both his nuts just
keep pounding him until he goes down.  He really shouldn't be overly tough, and
you should get an easy first round victory.

Once you win you'll be taken to the next set of stages where once again you can
get your characters to lend a helping hand.  Take this time to put all of your
Djinn on standby.  Take a look at all of the stages first to get an idea of
what they're like.  In the first stage you can get Garet to cheer for you, but
moving the statues around isn't going to help you one way or another.  The
second stage doesn't require anyone in it either.  Put Mia in the 3rd stage. 
No one can help in the 4th stage, so don't worry about it.  Stick Ivan at the
5th place simply because you need to put him somewhere and head back to the
guard at the entrance to the stands.  In Lend A Hand mode have both Ivan and
Garet talk to the guard to say they're finished.  Have Mia freeze the western
puddle and then get ready for the match to begin.

As always save right at the beginning of the Obstacle Course.  The first screen
is very easy to solve, just head around the blocks.  On the next screen, make
sure you jump twice when the blocks are in the center.  When you get the
western most block, head up and get the treasure chest which is a nut.  Head
back down onto the block and continue left.  On the next screen take the bottom
log left.  Head down the stump to the ledge and hop over the ice pillar to the
other side.  On the next level climb the wall.  When you get to the top head
left and slide down the MIDDLE crevice.  Hop over to the next screen which is a
simple log puzzle.  Basically you just have to move each log twice, once to the
left then once to the right.  You shouldn't have that much trouble getting to
the rink first.

It's now time to fight Satrage.  This guy has a little more HP than his
predecessor and does a little more damage.  Get him with Judgment right away,
then use the Ragnarok/Cure Well strategy that you used before.  Once again he
shouldn't pose that much of a threat to you.  Once you beat him you'll once
again be taken the next set of stages.  This one is pretty dang hard, so make
sure to study all of the stages before you start.

As usual, inactivate all of your Djinn before you start placing your friends. 
In the first stage you'll want to put Mia who has freeze.  In the next stage
put Garet who has move.  Don't place anyone in stage three, nor stage four, nor
stage five, and just stick Ivan at stage 6.  However, if you have the Halt Gem
(found in Vale) stick it on Ivan and stick him in Stage 3 with the moving wedge
blocks.  Head all the way back west to go the guard to start the next match. 
When you start to Lend a Hand have Garet move the stump one to the right.  Have
Ivan use Halt on the man pressing the lever, and have Mia freeze the puddle
that's under the moving lever.

It's now time for the Final Round obstacle course.  This one is the toughest
yet.  On the first screen just run past that log and hop over the two gaps.  On
the next screen hop to the first stump, then head down to the stump that Garet
moved for you.  Keep going right until you get to the next screen.  This next
stage is pretty tricky if you didn't have Halt to freeze the man controlling
the pillars.  Take you time going past the moving traps that will push you off.
 If you get really good you can get past two at a time, but don't push your
luck.  Ignore the easy to get treasure chest because you'll need all the time
that you can get.  The next stage, the wall, is pretty straightforward.  Just
climb primarily sideways until you get to the top.  Go down the stairs and run
across the conveyer belt.  The final stage is another log maze.  On this
screen, DON'T PUSH THE LOG WHEN YOU GET THERE.  You'll lose a lot of time if
you do this.  Instead, run past and push all three logs to the top, out of the
way of the log.  Then push the vertical log into the water and hop across to
the rink.  Hopefully you'll beat your competitor and get ready for a battle.

It's now time to battle Navampa, the final Collosso competitor.  He'll have
much more health than the others and do more damage.  Use the same strategy
that you've used for the previous two, summoning firs then using Cure
Well/Ragnarok.  Even though he has more HP and does a little more damage, he's
really not too hard to beat as long as you remembered to inactivate your Djinn
so that you had a 4 Level summon available.  Once you beat him you'll collapse
from exhaustion and eventually end up in your bed in the Castle.  The
characters will be annoying as ever and start talking about how you collapsed
after Collosso.  Once you're finally done and you're back in command, head out
the door to that room and go up the stairs.  Go up the hallway and through the
big door to meet Babi once more.  He'll start talking about how he needs more
draught and that the only place to get them is an island long disappeared. 
Then he asks you to go to Babi lighthouse to find the island.  He'll also give
you the Lure Cap which you can use to encounter more monsters than you usually
do, which is useful in leveling up for bosses.

Once you finally get command back of your character, follow Babi off to the
west and down the stairs.  Go through the door and take the item on Babi's
desk.  This is Babi's sacred Cloak Ball and he says that he will lend it to
you.  It's now to time go rescue Lord Hammet from Lupna.

------
To Lupna
------

Head out of the palace and continue south out of town.  Head south along the
dirt path until the path starts going east.  Follow it east for a while until
you reach a cave.  Once you enter you'll be inside of Gonodown Cave.  At the
first fork head west and continue north through the door and into the next
room.  In here you'll find a large rock that you'll have to use the Lift
Psynergy to get past.  Keep going along this hallway and into the next room. 
In this room there will be a small amount of water in the middle with a few
stepping stones to a ledge with a treasure chest.  This chest contains a Lucky
Medal that can be useful in obtaining items back in Tolbi.  Head across the
stepping stones the north and go back west a little until you find a treasure
chest.  In here you'll get an Apple that will boost your attack.  Once you've
done that head east along the wall until you reach the next door.  Head up the
staircase and then head south to arrive a log that's in your way.  Use your
Move Psynergy to move this log to the west and get it out of your path.  Keep
heading east until you come to a tree that you have to Move into a gap so that
you can cross the path.  Hop the gap, head south and go through the door to get
out of the cave.

Head around the cliff and then start heading north to reach Kalay.  You have no
business in Kalay at the current time, so head right past it and start heading
north.  When you cross the bridge head northeast and cross another bridge to
find yourself outside of Vault.  As with Kalay, you have no business in Vault
at the present time, so keep heading past it to the north.  After going north
for about 15 seconds you'll see the town of Lupna and an entrance to a cave a
little to the west of it.  You'll want to enter the cave entrance because the
guards won't let you through the gates.  In this cave head north along the
hallway until you reach a gate.  Under this gate you should see a small puddle
of water that needs freezing.  Do so to have the gate open up allowing you to
pass through.  Keep heading along the hallway and out the door to find yourself
inside the town of Lupna.

------
Lupna
------

Note: To beat Lupna's fortress you'll need the Cloak Ball that you get on the
desk of Babi and also Catch which you get by equipping Catch Beads (you have
this even if you don't think you have this.)

Things in Lupna look pretty cheerful, and the villagers of the town won't have
any problem with you roaming around the town.  However, if you try to buy the
latest weapons and armor you'll find that they dealers have nothing to sell
because no one can get in and out of Lupna (well, except for you ;-].)  The inn
won't be much help either, because for some reason the owner of the Inn has an
attitude and won't let anyone stay rest in his beds.  There are a few items to
get in Lupna, though.  Head to the north part of town to find the northern
gate.  Here there will be a small rock in the middle that you will want to
reveal.  On revealing, you will find a puddle that you should freeze.  Then,
head up the ladder a little to the west and hop over the ice pillar.  Make sure
that you don't step out of the reveal area or the ice pillar will disappear and
you'll have to do it again.  Once you're to the other side, keep heading
clockwise until you reach an apparent dead end.  Use reveal on the cliff to
find a small sparkle that you should press A against to reveal a hidden
entrance.  Go through here to find a room with a ton of treasure chests in it. 
Here's what they have:
Water of Life  Smoke Bomb	Lucky Medal	 Antidote
		   44 Coins		Elixir
When you get all of the items you want in this room, head back counterclockwise
and slip down the crevice in the side of the cliff that's next to the Potion
shop.  Head to the southwest part of the town to find a small rock circle that
has a Psynergy stone in it.

Once you're done with everything, head to the north pat of the town to find
yourself at the Lupna Fortress Gate.  You'll notice some guards here, and the
only way to get past them is to use cloak.  So, equip the Cloak Ball that you
got from the desk of Lord Babi on one of your characters, get in the shadows
and use the Cloak Psynergy.  Why do you have to be in the shadows to use Cloak?
 Well, if you go out of the shadows it won't work, which can get quite annoying
later in this cave.  any ways, sneak around in the shadows and go into the
Fortress.  At this time you'll want to set Cloak as one of your Hot keys (the L
or R button) for quick going to in the future.

Here's some information from Aditya Durgam [adurgam777@hotmail.com]:
"I have some information on the first group of three guards you encounter in
Lunpa Fortress: Guard #1 has anywhere from 248-492 HP; Guard #2 has anywhere
from 353-704 HP; Guard #3 has anywhere from 247-493 HP. Guard #2 has a smoke
bomb. Guard #3 does approx. 81 damage with his regular attack. Guard #1 has
some weird attack called "Slice". By beating them, you get 570 coins and some
"Crystal Powder".

Also, I have info on the second battle with the other guard. Here, he has
anywhere from 402-446 HP, most likely 446 HP. He has a smoke bomb. If you beat
him, you get 190 coins and approximately 160 experience points."

Head through the first door and go off to the right.  There will be two guards
here that you have to sneak past in the shadows, so use cloak to get by them. 
Go down the stairs and as soon as you get into the next room use Cloak.  Go all
around the center rock counterclockwise to sneak past the guard.  When you get
to the top your cloak will go away, so make sure to re-Cloak or risk getting
thrown out and having to start over.  Head through the door and then stop.  Put
on cloak and wait a few seconds for the moving guard to come up.  When he
branches off to the left sneak past him south and go through the door.  In the
next room use Cloak right away and start heading south along the shadows.  Head
up the stairs here and once again turn cloak on.  Here there will be two guards
going back and forth quickly in two separate hallways.  Between the two guard's
light will be a crevice where you can hide until the top guard goes back and
you can sneak past him too.  So, when the first guard starts going west sneak
past him and into the crevice.  When the next guard goes past sneak past him as
well and go into the next room.  In this room don't go up the stairs but
instead go along the hallway until you get to a door going south.  In here
there will be three guards in red that want to battle you as opposed to the
others who would kick you out.  These guys aren't the least bit tough, and 1
4-Level summon should knock these guys out.  Once they're defeated run past
them and go the next room.  Go along the hallway in this room to come to a
guard who will, like the three before him, want to fight.  He's just as hard as
any one of the three previous guards, so you shouldn't have any problem with
him.  Once you're done with him there will be two doors, one going north and
one going south.  Head through the door going north first to reach Donpa, who's
sick in bed, and his wife by his side.  There's a door behind her that she
blocks you from entering, so simply talk to her and see what she has to say
then leave.  Go through the door to the south to find a rather tricky guard
(you may want to save prior to going in this room.)  Right as you enter this
room use Cloak and stay where you are.  When the guard reaches his highest
point on the left, wait for him to go down a little then start heading south. 
You should be able to sneak past him and get to the next room.

The next room pits you behind some jail bars with a large key on the desk in
front of you.  To get this you'll have to use the Catch Psynergy that you got
in the beginning of the game when you left Vale for the first time.  Look
around for the Catch Beads item and equip it.  Go up to the bars and press
Select to bring up the in-game menu.  Go to Psynergy and use Catch to bring
yourself the key.  As soon as you go through the gate a guard will challenge
you to a fight.  He's as easy as ever, and you shouldn't have any problem
defeating him rather handily.  Continue down the stairs to find another room
with bars in it.  You need not go through the bars as the door in there leads
you to the start of the Fortress.  Go down the stairs and find yourself in a
room with a locked door an some leaves to the west of it.  Use Ivan's Whirlwind
Psynergy to clear the leaves.  Next, use Reveal to find the hidden switch that
you have to hit which opens the door.  In the next room hop across the small
river gap and go northeast.  Here you will find a door concealed by some
shrubs, so whirlwind then reveal the door to go through it.  In this room head
through the path in the middle to find a treasure chest with some Power Bread
in it that boosts a party member's attack.  Head down the hallway to the south
and go through the door.  Go up through the jail cell and start pushing the
large box south.  This is going to be a *long* push so go grab a snack while
you hit the down button.  Once the box is finally pushed down the ledge jump to
the left and go through the jail cell.  Do the whirlwind/ reveal thing again to
open the door.  In this next room save, because you're about to fight a boss. 
Put all of your Djinn (save Mia's so that she has Wish) on Standby and head
through the jail door.  In this room you'll find Lord Hammet (finally), and
after a little bit of conversation Dodonpa will come in.  He'll pull a lever
and reveal a giant monster that you'll have to fight.  Man, what a wuss... not
even fighting his own battles.  any ways, you're about to fight another boss,
this one being Toadonpa.

As always cast all of your summons on him to have him take a huge amount of
damage.  However, he's got a lot of HP so summons alone aren't going to do it. 
Watch out for his individual attacks that really pack a whollop, so have Mia
use her Wish on everyone each turn.  Have Isaac use his Ragnarok attack, have
Garet use his Heat Wave or Nova attack and have Ivan use his most powerful
Tornado attack each turn.  As long as the characters stay alive, and you use a
few Djinn each turn to get your Summons back, this guy shouldn't be too
difficult.  When you beat him you'll get a Psy Crystal which will be helpful
later in the game.

Once the battle is over you'll find Dodonpa trapped underneath the monster you
just fought.  Hammet will make you get it off of him and then talk for a while.
 This is one of the weakest moments of the plot that makes no sense ("Dodonpa
kidnapped you, remember?" "Oh yeah") and has you do nothing to Dodonpa because
he "learned his lesson."  Donpa will eventually come in and tell you that
you'll have to sneak out of town or some of Dodonpa's loyal henchmen will hunt
you down (oh not the tough guards that you fought before, anything but them). 
You'll automatically escape to outside of the Fortress, and from there go back
into the town and back into the cave from whence you came (10).  In the cave go
back along the hallway and flip the switch that's a little north of the gate. 
Keep heading south towards the cave exit to find one of Hammet's servants
(Bunza) sneaking around.  He'll offer you a ride in his wagon which you will
want to decline (if you did take it you will eventually leave you back in
Kalay).

The reason for declining the wagon ride is to get a Djinn in Lupna Fortress. 
To do this, you'll have to revisit Lupna after the whole conversation below
finishes.  Head back into and through the cave.  Head north in Lupna to the
fortress and sneak in.  This time there will be a nice little shortcut to get
where you want to go.  Head to the door to the southeast once you get into the
first large room to find a jail door that you can go through now that you have
the Cell Key.  Go through the jail door and up the stairs to the northeast. 
Fight the guard in here and then head through the jail cell and up north
through the door.  In the next room act quick, equip cloak and then run as
quickly as you can north to evade the guard.  Go through the door and fight the
guard blocking the entrance to Donpa's room.  Once you've defeaten him, head
into Donpa's room and talk to him.  He'll get up and he'll make his wife move
from blocking the door.  In here will be the Mercury Djinni Tonic that you will
get without a fight.  You're now free to leave Lupna, so retreat out, exit, and
continue on with your quests (see below.)

------
Kalay...Again
------

Head to the Inn in Kalay to heal all of your wounds that you got in Lupna. 
Once you're all rested, head out the inn and to the castle in the north part of
the town.  In the main hallway of the castle you'll see that servant Bunza
who's wagon helped Lord Hammet and your party flee from Lupna.  He'll tell you
that he left the Secret Entrance to the castle open.  Before you go to the
secret entrance, head to Lord Hammet's room to find a *really* ungrateful and
bitter Lady Layana who says that she didn't want you to go and that Kalay
should have handled it.  Once she's done being ungrateful, head out of the
room.  Before you go to the tunnel, you may want to get the water jacket
located in a treasure chest in a room in the west-going hallway in the castle. 
Once you're done doing that, head through the door on the east and go down the
stairs.  Go through the now open gate in this room and down the stairs.  In
this room keep going south to get 4 treasure chests with a few minor items in
there.  Now, it's once again time to push a statue a long distance.  Push the
statue next the treasure chests all the way to the north and then to the west. 
The objective here is to have the statue block the water fall to empty the
water in the room.  Once you've stopped the water flow, climb down the ladder
on the east and freeze the lone drop of water still left.  Now, climb up the
ladder and hop across the ice pillar to get some handy Spirit Gloves.  Head
back up the ladder on the right and go up the long tunnel to the north.  Head
up the stairs here, and in the next room proceed south then east.  When you get
to the east wall head north and down the stairs.  In this room head south along
the hallway to find another waterfall and a Djinn.  Like the previous
waterfall, push the statue into it to block its flow and drain the water. 
Simply head down the ladder and up the other ladder to get the Mars Djinn
Scorch without a battle.  Head back up the ladder and go to the east to find a
door that will take you on top of a cliff to the east part of Kalay.

Head out of Kalay and go southeast to get to reach Gondowan Cave again.  Back
track through this cave hopping over the river via the stumps you pushed in
earlier to backtrack more quickly (you could also use Retreat.)  Once you're
outside of the cave head northwest back towards Tolbi.  Head to the castle in
Tolbi to rest and then exit Tolbi once more.

------
To the Suhulla/Desert
------

Once you've exited Tolbi, head south over the bridge to meet up with Iodem, the
servant who was going to help you get to Babi Lighthouse after Collosso.  Once
you're across the bridge, keep heading southeast until you reach Suhulla.  The
first thing you want to do in Suhulla is to head to the house with a red carpet
on the roof which is located in the southwestern part of town.  In here Iodem
will find two downed warriors who were unable to get past the monsters in
Suhulla Desert.  They'll also reveal that they lost Sheba, a girl who has some
importance to Iodem.  They also reveal an important detail for getting past the
sandstorms, which is that you can get past the sandstorms with water.  Finally,
they also reveal that Saturous, etc. got through and are at this very moment on
their way to Babi Lighthouse (dramatic music plays.)  Once Iodem's done talking
in there, you can now head out of the town and south into the Suhulla Desert.

------
Suhulla Desert
------

When you first enter the desert, you may be surprised to see that there isn't a
heat bar on the side this time like there was in the Lamarkan Desert.  Instead,
the main obstacle of this desert is small tornados that will sweep you up and
land you back in the village of Suhulla.  In order to get past these Tornados
you'll need to drench them with Douse that you get by equipping Douse Drop (you
should have this item from beating Manticore in the previous Desert.)  Set
Douse as one of your Hot keys (such as the L or R button ) and get ready to go
through the Suhulla Desert.  Besides the tornados, the random battle monsters
that you fight in this level are going to be much more difficult than what you
had experienced in the past.  Make sure to not go into random battles without
full health.  Here's a neat little thing about Suhulla Desert: If you use
reveal you can sometimes find footsteps of hints on where to go (of course, you
can also just use this walkthrough ;-] ).

Thanks to Aditya Durgam [adurgam777@hotmail.com] for this information on the
enemies in the desert:
The Tornado Lizards that dwell in the Suhalla Dessert have approximately 642
HP. After beating them, you get 477 coins and 620 experience points (may vary
from lizard to lizard). The Storm Lizard has 3123 HP. His attacks include Wing
Stroke, Impact, Tempest, Storm Ray, and Resistance. His normal attack has done
an average of 95 HP damage.  He gives you 6100 coins when you beat him.

When you enter the desert you'll want to head West until you get to a wall
where you'll want to head south.  When the path becomes very narrow it will be
time for the first sand storm to appear.  When it does, Iodem will pop out and
mention how there are so many of these in the desert and that it's unusual. 
Now, head into the sand storm and use Douse.  After the rain stops, you'll fall
down to the bottom of the Cyclone and face the large monster, Tornado Lizard. 
Tornado Lizards are much harder than regular Random Battle enemies, but they're
not quite boss like.  1 or 2 4-Level summons should be able to whipe these guys
clean off of the face of the earth.  So, before going into any tornado put all
of your Djinn on Standby (except Mia's, of course, so that you get Wish) and
get ready for a battle.  Tornado Lizard really doesn't have a devastating
attack, so you can afford to not use Wish every turn.  If you don't want to use
your Summons on him, do the simple Ragnarok/Attack/Plasma/Attack strategy
(going from Isaac to Mia) strategy with the occasional Wish and Djinn to beat
him pretty easily.

When you beat the Tornado Lizard the sand storm will disappear and you'll be
able to continue southeast.  Keep going until you get to three sandstorm paths
that you can go through.  You'll want to hit the path that's most the east and
fight another Tornado Monster.  Use the same strategy mentioned before.  Once
you defeat him, keep going along the path as it progresses to due west and end
up on the next screen.

As soon as you get to the next screen there will be another 3-Path choice each
with its own sandstorm.  The path that you want to take is the middle path. 
So, go up in the sandstorm and use Douse on it to fight another Tornado Lizard.
 Once again use the same strategy that you used before to defeat him easily. 
When you've defeated the Tornado Lizard, continue advancing north along the
hallway.  The hallway will head very linearly for quite a while.  Eventually
you'll see a pink sand storm on your right.  This pink sand storm will take you
to Crossbone Island, which I'll cover a little later in the game.  However, you
will want to head that way to get another Djinn.  In order to find the Djinn,
use Reveal to find a hidden stump to jump over to a ledge to the west.  This
ledge is a little north of the ladder leading down from the ledge.  Once you've
revealed the stump, jump across it and head down the ladder.  Here you'll find
a Mars Djinn that you will have to battle.  He'll have some reasonably powerful
fire attacks, so make sure to heal with Mia and don't be arrogant.  Once you
beat him you'll get the Mars Djinn Flash.  Flash is a *very* useful Djinn
especially later on in the game because he has the ability to block a lot of
damage taken to the whole party.

Now, head back up the ladder and go east (going through that cave will take you
to the pink sand storm which we don't want to go to yet.)  Before you head down
the ladder, you'll want to save and inactivate all of your Djinn (of course,
keep 4 of Mia's active.)  However, if you have much more than 4 Djinn for some
the characters, you may want to activate Djinn like Flint, Quartz, Scorch,
Flash and Squall.  Now, head down the ladder and go south a little.  Suddenly a
giant sand storm will come after you.  My advice is to just stay where you are
and let it get you to avoid random attacks.  Once you're in it, use Douse like
usual to drop down and fight the monster.

This monster isn't just another Tornado Lizard.  The monster that you now face
is a Storm Lizard and he's a mean mama-jama (a la Shaft.)  Storm Lizard has a
Sonic Slash attack that's simply devastating.  It will attack all of your Party
Members and do at least 150 damage to all of them.  First things first, cast
all of your Summons.  For each round use Wish with Mia.  With Isaac, use
Ragnarok and occasionally Flint.  Also, if a player goes down use Quartz that
you should have active by now to restore that player.  With Garet you'll want
to use Heat Wave unless the party is hurting when you'll want to use the Djinn
Flash who will reduce damage taken to each character in that round to about 8. 
With Ivan you should use primarily Djinn that attack or do some sort of status
change to Storm Lizard in hopes to stunning him.  Another good Djinn to use
with Ivan is Zephyr which will boost party agility.  If you use a lot of Djinn,
it's possible to cast another high level summon on the Storm Lizard which will
really help you out.  Generally by the time you cast another Summon, Storm
Lizard will be under 500 HP and you should be able to kill him with it.  When
you kill him you'll get 1300 experience and 6100 coins in addition to a handy
Psy Crystal (keep saving these.)  If you are unable to beat Tornado Lizard,
here a few tips to help you out:  Try running south to a rock circle similar to
that in the Lamarkan desert with a Psy Crystal in it.  You can also outrun the
tornado all together if you're quick, because you really don't need to fight it
(although I recommend doing it for the experience and Psy Crystal.)

any ways, once you've defeated the Storm Lizard, head south and grad the
Psynergy Stone in the rock circle.  Keep going along the sole path to finally
spot an exit going east.  Iodem will jump out and mention how they didn't find
Sheba.  Don't worry about her, you'll meet up with her later.  Instead, keep
going out the desert and head east to enter Suhulla Gate.

------
Suhulla Gate
------

Head up all of the stairs at Suhulla Gate to find two guards injured on the
ground.  They'll tell of a strange group of people who came through without any
papers (wonder who they could be?)  Once Iodem is done talking , head north
through the gate to find a small door that contains a minister that will revive
downed characters.  Once you're done with him, head east to get to the next
screen.  On this screen you'll see an area where you can slide down the side of
the mountain almost immediately.  Slide down to find a treasure chest with a
mint in it.  Climb back up all of the vines and advance to the next screen.  On
this screen you'll see several areas that you an slide down the mountain in a
row.  The one that you want to slide down is the third from the left.  This
will land you right next to a Mercury Djinn who you'll have to battle.  Use the
typical Ragnarok/Attack/Plasma/Wish strategy with optional summons in the
beginning of the battle.  Defeat him to get the Mercury Djinn Dew.  Now, slide
down the cliff you're on and head east.  Head up one vine to find a cave that
you need not enter at this point in time (this leads to a ship that you'll use
much later in the game.)  Keep heading up the vines until you get to the top of
the cliff once more and head east.  Keep going east past the downed guard and
down the stairs.  Eventually you'll find yourself back on the world map.  Start
heading northeast towards the Venus Lighthouse.

------
Venus Lighthouse Part 1
------

When you get close to Venus lighthouse you will get out of the world map and
into the Venus Lighthouse entrance.  Head past all of the downed guards (you
don't need to read what they say) and keep going along the path until you get
to Venus Lighthouse.  Enter the lighthouse and go through the first room which
is just a hallway.  In this next room you'll see a large tree on the ground. 
Use reveal when standing on this tree to expose a hidden door in the wall just
above you.  Head down this door and open the treasure chest to get the Carry
Stone which gives you the Carry psynergy.  The Carry psynergy allows you to
pick up small blocks and place them in different positions.  Head out of this
room and back into the room with the tree on the floor.  Go through the door to
the north.  Here there will be two paths.  The first one you should take is the
path to the east.  Head down the stairs and into a room with several stepping
stones.  Head west, then southeast to reach the south part of the room.  Head
up the stairs here to find the Lucky Cap.  Now, head back and you'll want to
take the path on the west in the room past the tree room.  Go through the door
and into the next room.  In this room there will be stairs leading up that you
need not take.  Instead, head through the door in the northeast part of the
room.  In the next room you will find a small block preventing you from
entering the other staircase in this room.  So, use your new Carry Psynergy on
it and carry it south to drop the block out of the way.  Now, go up the stairs
and into the next room.  In here you will see several bands of electricity that
you can not pass.  So, use the Reveal Psynergy to find a new, secret staircase
right next to the one you just came from.  Proceed up the staircase and in the
next room go north along that long, narrow passage way.  Here you will come to
a room with a miniature lighthouse and a statue of a women at the northern part
of the room.  Go talk with the statue to have her speak to your soul and reveal
a path on the ground.  This path should have one light in the center with a
different color from all the rest.  Once you've done this, use retreat and head
out of the lighthouse.

Head out the Venus Lighthouse entrance area to the east to arrive back at the
World Map.  Head north and then west along the dirt path to arrive at the next
town which is...

------
Lalivero
------

As soon as you enter Lalivero, you'll find two guards to the city lying on the
ground injured.  Iodem will talk to them and discover that Sheba was with
Saturous and the rest and that they went through town destroying whoever was in
their path.  Once that's over with, head to the Inn in the northwestern part of
town to heal all of your party members.  Once you're done, head out the inn and
locate the weapons and armor shop in the southeastern part of town.  Buy the
latest upgrades for all of your characters, but don't exit the shop.  See that
ladder in the back?  Head up that to arrive on the roof.  When you arrive on
the roof, hop over the gate on the right.  From here start to head north until
you reach the northeastern corner.  Jump the building a little south of that
and across the next building.  Go up the vine and check the jar on the left to
get some Water of Life.  Now head back down the vine and back across the gap
and onto the gate again.  Go around the northeast corner and start heading
west. You'll see the Djinn on top of the roof, but go a little past that to the
next building where you can hop onto.  Do so and then hop across to the
building with the Djinn and then up the vine.  Go up the Djinn to get the Mars
Djinn Torch without a battle.  Now, head back from whence you came (11) all the
way around the city gate and back down the ladder in the weapons shop.  Now,
head to the building in the southwestern part of town that also has a ladder on
top of it.  Go in the building and climb up the ladder to arrive on the roof. 
Hop onto the gate and start moving counterclockwise.  After going over the gate
the city you should see a vine going down leading to a treasure chest.  Open
this treasure chest to get a Warrior's Helm.  Head back to the building and go
down the ladder and out of the building.  Now, head out of Lavlivero via the
path to the north.  Right above Lalivero is Babi's Lighthouse.
Note: If you ever need it there is a Psy Crystal hidden in the Pointed Statue
on a small island in the middle of the town.  You shouldn't need it, however,
since there is an inn in this town.  Thanks to Alan Quirino
[grayfox_2510@hotmail.com] for that information.

------
Babi Lighthouse
------

Note: If you have not yet visited Venus Lighthouse, please go back and do so
(see Venus Lighthouse Part 1 topic above.)  You will need to talk to the statue
in there to avoid a dead end in Babi's Lighthouse.

Babi's Lighthouse is under construction, and you don't actually enter the tower
in this game.  Instead, you're going to want to find the hidden entrance to
Venus Lighthouse through the ruins that Babi Lighthouse were built on.  Head
north along the west part of the screen along the orange logs until you reach
the next screen.  UPDATED: Keep going north and go down the ladder next to the
statue.  In the dungeon down here you'll see two large pillars.  Move the left
most pillar to the left, then go back from whence you came (12).  Go east to
find another statue.  Move this to expose another ladder which you want to go
down.  Move the pillar on the right to the left and now hop across the gap to
the other side.  Keep going north and head up the ladder here.  You'll arrive
outside of Babi's Lighthouse on top of a ledge.  Use Grow on the vine near you,
and climb up it.  Head down the Crevice hear and go through the door.  Now,
head down the crevice here to land right next to a Jupiter Djinn who you'll
have to battle.  Once you defeat him you'll get the Jupiter Djinn, Luff.  Head
down the crevice.  In this room head around the gap clockwise and go through
the door to the north.  Go up the stairs once more to arrive in a room with
three crevices to drop down.  You want to drop down the first crevice that you
can get to, heading just south.  You'll fall *all* the way down past the first
floor that you entered to a dirt cave with a door blocking the path.  There
will also be several archeologists who mention that Saturos and company went
through this door that they had not been able to open prior to Saturos and
company coming through.  Once they're all done talking, go up the door and use
Reveal.  A switch will appear where the sign once was.  Flip this to open up
the door.  The others in the room will be amazed that you solved such a
"complex" puzzle and try to run through on their own.  The door will close shut
because non-adepts are not allowed through the door.  So, Iodem will now leave
your party (he didn't do too much any ways) while you continue through the
door.  Head down the stairs to find yourself in the Temple Ruins.

In this room you'll see another statue exactly like the one that you saw in
Venus Lighthouse.  You don't need to touch this one, because it will just throw
you off saying it's not going to open your path.  any ways, go through the door
going south to arrive in the next room.  In this room you'll see two large
pillars that you'll have to move to jump from the main ledge to the next ledge.
 Move the pillars in such a fashion so that the first pillar is all the way
against the right wall and 1 square from the top.  The next pillar should be 2
squares under if so that you can jump from the gap to the two pillars and to
the ledge.  Do so and continue to the next room.  This next room is the
crossing into Venus lighthouse, and the formation of the stepping stones you
hop depends on which pattern the statue in Venus Lighthouse part 1 showed.

------
Venus Lighthouse Part 2
------

This walkthrough is now going to fork depending on the path that you take (your
path is determined by the tiles on the floor that you can change by talking
with the statue in Venus Lighthouse.)  This first part is the guide for going
West:

In this next room there will be another similar pillar puzzle.  Move one of the
pillars one down and directly left and another pillar 2 squares below it to
allow you to hop from the top ledge to the ledge to the west.  Head down this
ledge and into the next door.  Yet another pillar moving puzzle awaits you in
the next room where you should push 1 of the pillars all the way to the left,
and another two squares to the east of it.  Cast Ivan's Whirlwind against the
large plant and then do it again to the other side to reveal another pillar. 
Now, push one of the original pillars all the way back to the east and push the
next pillar 2 squares directly south of it.  Now, head back up the stairs and
hop over the pillars onto the ledge.  Whirlwind the brush there and head
through the door.  Head all of the way south through the narrow hallway in the
room to arrive at a door.  Head through to find a room with three small
pillars.  Push one of them directly above the little white ledge and use Carry
to put the statue down there.  Repeat the process to bring the ledge on the
left all of the way up allowing you to jump the large ledge to the left.  Head
through the hallway and through the door.  In this room you'll have two paths
to take.  Take the path to the left to find a large statue on an elevated
platform.  Head up the stairs south of the platform and use reveal to expose a
treasure chest with an Oracle's Robe in it.  Head out of the room and hop
across to the ledge on the right now.  Go south to enter a room with 5
different color statues.  This is where this path meets the Southern past, so
skip past the following section to continue with this guide.

Here is the guide for going South:

Once you get into the room after the stepping stones you will see a pillar with
water in it and a path leading to a water drop.  Push the pillar onto the water
drop to make another pillar come up.  Hop across this pillar to the ledge on
the west.  Head south and do the same pushing to water drop thing you just did
with the pillar down there.  However, this time you're going to have to use
Douse (equip Douse Drop on a character) to cause this pillar to be heavy enough
to bring the pillar up.  Then, head across the pillar and into the next room. 
This next room contains more stepping stones, with a fork in the path.  Head
west to find a room with a statue and apparently a dead end.  Use Reveal to
expose a treasure chest with Asura's Armor in it.  Once you get the armor, head
back out of the room and head to the ledge in the southwest part of the room. 
This room is a little tricky, so pay attention.  Head down the southern most
part that you can get to.  Get as close are you can to a 1 square gap between
you and the pillar.  Move the pillar south and then start pushing it to the
northeastern most point.  Now, use Douse on this pillar and head up the stairs.
 Stand facing the pillar and use Frost on it.  Now, go up the final set of
stairs and head from the top ledge to the ice pillar to the ledge to the east. 
Head south and out of the room.  In the next room, head left across the
stepping stone and continue south into a room with 5 colored statues.

In order to open the door in this room with 5 colored statues, you'll have to
mind read the statues, or you can just put them in this order:
Red	Blue
   Gold
Green Violet
Once all of the statues are on their squares head through the now open door to
find a room with a tree in it.  No secret rooms this time, just head up the
stairs.  In this room there will be a Psynergy stone, so heal and use any other
spells you want to use before getting the stone.

Head into the room to the north and go to the first door on your left.  Here
you have to use carry on the small block to put it into the gap.  Now, hop over
it and go through the door.  Head up the narrow hallway and then cross the sand
going east.  Head up the stairs to find a room with several small sand
waterfalls.  Head through the sand waterfall to the far right to find yourself
in the next room.  Head west to get to a stepping stone path where you'll want
to head along the right wall.  Head all the way down to the door there to find
a room with a statue and an elevated piece that looks like this: [ | ].  That
solid line in the middle is for flowing electricity, so put that in the empty
hole in the room to have electricity come from the statue and open the door. 
Head through it and step on the small purple switch in the next room to change
around the sand waterfalls.  Continue counterclockwise around this room until
you get to the next door going south.  This will get you back to a room you
were in earlier.  Here you'll want to head down the ladder and up the ladder to
the north of it.  Head across the sand waterfall and go through the door.  Head
to the southeast part of the room and go down the ladder.  Move the two pillars
there to expose a doorway leading to the other pillar to the north.  Push that
pillar all the way to the west and then head back and up the ladder.  Hop from
the ledge to the west onto the pillar and then onto the ledge to the north and
up the stairs.  Go down the ladder and under the bridge in the next room then
up the other ladder.  Go up the stairs here and through the door to get to the
next room.

It's now time for another one of those electric current puzzles.  Push the
right most block into the southwestern hole, push the left most block into the
northwestern hole and push the north most block into the northeastern hole. 
Leave the southeastern hole without a block in it.  If you did this correctly
there should be a solid line for the electric current to go through and it will
open the door.  Proceed through the door to reach another room with a sand
waterfall in it.  Hop over the pillar here and go up when you get to the ledge
directly east of the sand waterfall, then cross the sand waterfall and hop over
the gap to the northwestern ledge via a pillar.  Head through the south door to
find another room with many sand waterfalls.  Head through the eastern most
sand waterfall to find the Dragon Scales.  Head through the sand waterfall on
the left and up the stairs.  In this room you'll have to use Carry to drop 2
small blocks on the western white ledge.  Doing so will allow you to hop across
the eastern white block and to the ledge to the east.  Go through the door and
step on the purple switch to change around sand waterfall locations again. 
Head directly north from the switch across a gap and go down the stairs to
arrive in the room with the large sand waterfalls.  Now that the waterfall on
the left is flowing, go down it and to the ledge in the southwestern part of
the room.  Head up the staircase on this ledge to get to the next room.

In this next room head south through a door to find a new room with moving sand
currents.  The objective of this room is to get to the ledge to the east and to
get the treasure chest in the south which contains the best weapon in the game,
the Gaia Blade, so you're going to have to time your movements well.  There
really isn't too much to right about, it's more about execution in this room. 
One thing to try, however, is running to get a little more control (you need to
know where you're going, though)  Head to the door to your right to find
yourself in yet another electric current puzzle.  This is the toughest puzzle
yet, and it took me a few trial and errors to figure out the correct way. 
Rather than describing this I drew a picture.  Go to
http://comicsoft.hypermart.net/gsa/w_001.gif for the solution to the puzzle. 
It's not great, but you should be able to figure it out.  The tan squares with
lines drawn through them correspond to what shape you want to put where.  Once
you've done that the door will open and you should head through it.  In the
next room, head west a little bit to expose a purple switch that you'll have to
press to once again mix up and create new sand waterfalls.  Hop directly north
from the switch and continue along the path.  In the middle of some empty space
will be a blue and white colored pad hovering in mid air.  This will be the pad
that you'll fall down to just a little bit later.  For now, head north across
the gap and down the stairs.  Head south through the next door to find yourself
slipping down the middle waterfall.  Head to the ledge to the right, then move
all the way north and head east across the sand.  If you're having trouble
getting across the sand waterfall, remember to hold B to run, the direction
you're going and up at the same time so that you won't fall.  Head up the
stairs on this ledge and then up the stairs again.  ABSOLUTELY FOR THE LOVE OF
GOD SAVE YOUR GAME IN A DIFFERENT PLACE THAN YOUR NORMAL GAME.  TRUST ME, IT
WILL BE HELPFUL TO YOU LATER ON.

On this floor you will find a Psynergy stone (don't take this yet) and a
crevice leading down to that blue and white floating elevator that you saw
earlier.  Do not head down the ledge until you are ready to go to the top of
the lighthouse and fight the boss of the game.  At this point, I would equip my
Lure Cap and start leveling up if you're under about Level 24 or so.  This
probably won't take a lot of leveling up, but do make sure to conserve your
Psynergy.  Try to use only your Djinn and normal attacks reserving Psynergy for
only healing attacks.  You may also want to use Herbs and Nuts at this time to
save yourself from wasting Psynergy (you won't be needing these against the
boss.)  Save frequently here, as the monsters are very tough and occasionally
they can get one or more of your character's down.  Alternatively, another way
to level up is to use Retreat and backtrack to Crossbone Island.

------
What!?  We're Backtracking!?
------

Yes, it's time to go *back* to Suhulla Desert to get to Crossbone Island.  Why
didn't we just go earlier, when we were in Suhulla Desert?  This is because you
needed to get Carry to solve a few of the puzzles in Crossbone Island and it
would be trivial to go earlier because you'd just have to go back from
Crossbone Island when you got stuck.  Nevertheless, head out Venus Tower via
Retreat and make your way out of Lalivero and start heading southwest.  If
you're trying to level up, stop at the inn, put on the Lure Cap and start
fighting enemies in the base of Babi tower.  Go west through Venus Lighthouse
entrance and keep going west until you reach Suhulla Gate again.  Backtrack
from there all the way until you get outside of the gate and back into the over
world map.  Keep going west until you reach the Suhulla Desert.  At this point
you'll want to make a separate save game different from the save game that you
have at Lalivero.  When you get into Suhulla Desert, head west around the
hallway and up the steps.  Remember the hidden pillar that you had to reveal to
get the Djinn a little earlier?  Well, reveal this again and hop across.  Head
down the ladder here and this time go through the cave.

Head east along the long passage way and up the stairs when you get to them. 
Head south out of the next room to find yourself right next to a pink sand
storm (I wonder if Isaac sees pink sand storms when he's drunk as opposed to
pink elephants ;-] ).  Go into the sand storm, but DO NOT DOUSE THIS TORNADO or
you'll have to go out of Suhulla Desert and then back in.  Instead, let it
sweep you up and take you to...

------
Crossbone Island
------

When you get to Crossbone Island, head to the southern part of it.  You'll see
an indentation in the mountains when you get to the southern part of the
island, so head north to it to find the entrance to Crossbone Island.  When the
world map disappears, go to the west to find a vine that you have to use growth
on.  Repeat this process two times until you're at the top of the cliff.  There
will be three crevices to fall down here.  The crevice on the left will take
you to the north of those tree stumps and next to a shrub that you should
whirlwind to expose the entrance to Crossbone Island Cave.  The middle crevice
leads to a chest with 1 coin, and the right crevice leads to a chest with a
mint in it.  When you go down the crevice on the left and whirlwind the door,
enter it to enter the cave.  Head north along the hallway until you get to a
large staircase to go down.  Do so and arrive at the first floor of Crossbone
Island Cave.

On each floor in Crossbone Island there are several treasure chests.  In this
guide I will mention how to beat the boss in the first paragraph, how to get
the treasure chests in the second paragraph, and in the third paragraph I will
mention how to actually solve the room and get to the next one.

One thing to note about Crossbone Island is that there aren't random battle
encounters, which is quite nice.  Instead, there are "Door Enemies" that you'll
have to fight before you can enter in a door.

Also, whenever you come out of a door in Crossbone Island make sure that you
push the stump down so that you'll have easy access past rooms you've already
gone through if you need to head out of the cave and then back in for any
reason.

-Floor 1-

The first of these Door Enemies is a Hobgoblin and a Virago.  These guys aren't
all too tough, because you'll be free to cast all of your summons right off the
bat (remember, there aren't any random battle encounters in Crossbone Island.) 
3 Level-4 Summons should wipe these guys out of the cave, giving you a Lucky
Medal and access to the first floor.

CHEST 1:
Location: Southwest corner of the room.
Item: 111 Coins.
Directions: Hop onto the ledge right below the stump and push it to the left. 
Head counterclockwise across the gaps to get to the treasure chest.
Notes Before Obtaining the Next One: Head out of the room.
CHEST 2:
Location: Southeast corner of the room.
Item: Nut.
Directions: Hop onto the ledge below the stump and move it to the left.  Jump
onto the platform with the stump and head right.  The chest is directly east of
the platform.
Notes.....: Head out of the room.
CHEST 3:
Location: Northwest corner of the room.
Item: Hard Nut
Directions: Hop onto the ledge below the stump and move it to the right.  From
the ledge head to the left and move the stump to the north and move the log
there to the right.  Head north along the stepping stone path on the left.
Notes: Head off of the platform but you need not go out of the room.
CHEST 4:
Location: North-center part of the room, not on a stepping stone.
Item: Antidote
Direction: Head counterclockwise all of the way around the outer ledge.

To get out of the room you'll need to make sure that you haven't moved any
stumps yet (head out of the room if you have.)  Hop onto the small stepping
stone below the only log visible.  Move the log to the right and head northwest
to the next stump on a ledge.  Move this log to the left and start making your
way east until you can't go east any further.  Once you're there, head north
until you reach the northeast corner.  Start heading west until you come to a
ledge with a stump to the left.  Move this stump east one square, then start
heading back from whence you came (13?)  Make your way to the stump in the
middle that you haven't moved yet.  Move this to the right and jump onto it. 
Now you'll want to make your way to the log you moved earlier northwest of the
log you just moved.  Move this log to the east, hop on to the platform and make
your way to the long outer ledge.  Head all the way down this ledge and out the
door.  When you exit the room there will be a treasure chest here that's
actually a Mimic.  You probably will want to fight him at this point for his
experience points.

-Floor 2-

The next enemies that you'll have to face are two Grislys and a Sucubus
(reminds me of a South Park episode.)  As always, put all the Djinn on standby
(even Mia's at this point) and just let the Summons Rip.  These guys will die
to approximately three Level-4 summons, so you really don't have anything to
worry about.

CHEST 1:
Location: Just north of you when you enter the room.
Item: Elixir
Directions: Just head north, this isn't head to get.
Notes: None.
CHEST 2:
Location: Northeast of Chest 1.
Item: 222 Coins.
Directions: Simply head around the blocks counterclockwise from Chest 1 to find
Chest 2 without having to roll and logs.
Notes: None.
CHEST 3:
Location: Northeast corner of the screen.
Item: Lucky Pepper
Directions: From Chest 2, head around the block and head to the east most point
then go up.  No rolling required.
Notes: None.
CHEST 4:
Location: Northwest from Chest 1.
Item: Mystery Blade
Directions: Push the log above Chest 1 up, then head to near Chest 3 in the
northeast part of the screen and push the vertical log to the left.  Head down
and around the broken pillar and go next to Chest 2.  Push the horizontal log
there up, and then push the horizontal log that was right below it up as well. 
Now, head northwest of Chest 1 and push the vertical log to the right and the
horizontal log up.
Notes: None.

To get out of Room 2, simply follow the directions for Chest 4 and just head
south along the west corner of the screen to find the exit.

-Floor 3-

The next door enemies that you'll have to face are a Lich and two Fiendish
Ghouls.  These guys still aren't very tough and three Level-4 summons should
get them.  When they're defeated you'll get a handy Psy Crystal for use in
battles later in the game.

CHEST 1: (Left Most)
Gem Location: Just a little northeast of the door.
Item: 333 Coins.
Directions: Equip Catch Beads and use Catch when facing the blue gem on the
part of the original platform that you were on when you entered the room that's
the most northeast.
Notes: To get to the Blue Door where you need to use this game, simply go back
to the main platform and then head along the northwest stepping stone path to
get to the top ledge (the same applies for getting to all of the blue doors.)
CHEST 2: (2nd to the Left)
Gem Location: Due east of Gem 1.
Item: Fairy Ring
Directions: From the northwest corner of the original platform start hopping
southeast.  Eventually when you get to the eastern wall the stepping stones
will allow you to make a U-Turn and arrive directly east of the gem.  Use Catch
on it to get the second Gem.
Notes: See Chest 1's Notes.
CHEST 3: (2nd from the Right)
Gem Location: Northeast of Gem 1.
Item: Cookie.
Directions: Head along the western stepping stones as if you were going to the
blue doors, but head one square to the east when you can.  Start moving north
until you arrive at a row with two long platforms with a small platform in
between them.  Face south towards the gem and use Catch to obtain it.
Notes: See Chest 1's Notes.
CHEST 4: (Right Most)
Gem Location: North-northeast of Gem 3.
Item: Smoke Bomb
Directions: From the main platform head northeast, then due north when it
starts to straighten out.  You'll find yourself right underneath Gem 4 which
you should use Catch to get.
Notes: See Chest 1's Notes.

From Chest 4 (not Gem 4) Head directly south to land on the northern most
square of a circle.  Use reveal to expose a hidden Red Gem in the middle which
you should use Catch on.  Once you get the gem start heading west along the
north ledge when there blue doors were and head down the stepping stones on the
western side of the screen.  About three from the south you'll be able to jump
west to the ledge with the red door.  Do so and continue through it, then head
south and out of Floor 3.

-Floor 4-

The door enemies for Floor 4 are two Gryphon birds.  As always, use all of your
Summons against them.  This may or may not kill all of them, and if there's one
remaining just use Ragnarok with Isaac, attack with Garet, defend with Ivan and
Wish with Mia.  The Grpyhons shouldn't have too much HP after getting hit by
four Level-4 Summons, so don't worry about dieing too much.

CHEST 1:
Location: North and a little east of the center of the screen.
Item: 444 Coins
Directions: Go up to the second statue that you reach when going east from the
door.  Use Halt on this statue when you have it up against a wall to sneak by
it.  Once you get into the shadows use cloak to sneak by another concealed
statue and use reveal to figure out where you're going.  This statue can be
obtained by heading to the north wall and going west a little.
Notes: Head back outside the statue.
CHEST 2:
Location: Due north of the first statue that you get to going east from the
door.
Item: Sleep Bomb
Directions: Go up to the first statue that you get to when going east from the
door.  Move to the right on it and halt it, then sneak past and use reveal to
find a treasure chest at the northern most part of this hallway.
Notes: Go back south once you're done.
CHEST 3:
Location: Northeast corner of the screen.
Item: Storm Gear
Directions: Go up the second statue that you reach when going east from the
door and halt it.  Go north and put on cloak to sneak past the first statue. 
Use reveal to find out where you're going.  A little past the statue in the
dark take a right to arrive near a statue in pure daylight.  Sneak past this
statue by staying in the shadows and head clockwise past the statue to get to
the treasure chest.
Notes: Head back out to near the entrance door when you're done.
CHEST 4:
Location: Near the exit door.
Item: Psy Crystal.
Directions: See exiting the room in the next paragraph.
Notes: None.

To exit the room, head west from the entrance door and go up the narrow passage
way.  Put on cloak when you get to the shadows, and stay in the shadows for as
long as possible to get past the statue here.

-Floor 5-

The next door enemies are a Lizard King, a Harridan and two stone soldiers.  As
always summon the hell out of 'em (make sure the big arrow falls on the
Lizard.)  After one or two summons everything but the Lizard King will be gone,
but he'll stay alive through four summons.  The Lizard King also deals a pretty
good blow, and if you're not careful Ivan might get hurt (you may actually want
to defend him in the first round and do a 4-Summon in the next round if you're
afraid of him dieing.)

CHEST 1:
Location: Northeast corner of the screen, near the stairs.
Item: 555 Coins
Directions: Just head around the ledge counterclockwise to find this Chest. 
It's near the stairs.
Notes: None.
CHEST 2:
Location: North-center part of the screen
Item: Lucky Medal
Directions: Head down the stairs located at the northeast part of the screen. 
Move the first vertical log that you seen to the left and move the horizontal
log directly southeast of that up.  Move the vertical log back to the right,
and head out of the lower area and flip the switch to bring water in.  Hop
across the log pattern you just set up to reach the chest.
Notes: Head out of the room when you've completed this.
CHEST 3:
Location: Southwest part of the screen.
Item: Ninja Garb
Directions: Head down the stairs into the lower area of the screen.  Head west
until you see two vertical logs with the edge of a horizontal log in between
them.  Push the lower vertical log to the east, then push the horizontal log
south.  Push the lower vertical log west, then push the horizontal log to the
right of the upper vertical log south.  Now, push the lower vertical log that's
to the west back east, then push the horizontal log you just pushed back up. 
Now, go back to the switch to fill the area up with water, and hop across the
path you made to get the chest.
Notes: Go out of the room when you've completed this.
CHEST 4:
Location: Northwest part of the screen
Item: Potion
Directions: See exiting the room in the next paragraph, it will be directly
west of when you hop off the logs in the pattern below.
Notes: None.

To get out of the room, head down the stairs in the northeast part of the
screen.  Push the 2nd east most horizontal log south, then move the
northeastern most vertical log east.  Move the horizontal log one square
southwest of it north.  Push the northern most vertical log west, then push the
horizontal log you moved south earlier back north.  Push the vertical log
that's now up against the west wall back east, then push the horizontal log
directly north of it south.  Now, flood the area by hitting the switch, and
head across the path you've created.  Hop to the ledge and head all of the way
south and out of the door.

-Floor 6-

The door enemies for this floor are two Chimeras, which are three-headed lion
type creatures.  As always, unleash all of the summons on them in the first
round.  One of them will probably die to four Level-4 summons, with the other
being badly damaged.  Ragnarok with Isaac, Attack with Garet, Defend with Ivan
and use Ply Well with Mia to get this guy.  If you have a Level-3 Summon
available at this point (by having 7 Djinn) use it and you'll almost certainly
wipe out the last Chimera.  When you defeat him you'll get a potion and advance
through the next door.

CHEST 1:
Location: North-northeast of the door.
Item: Elixir
Directions: Move stumps that you see when you enter the door so that 1 is all
the way to the left and another is one from the right.  Hop across the stumps
to get the treasure chest to the north.
Notes: None.
DJINN:
Location: Northwest corner of the screen (initially)
Directions: From Chest 1, head north until you get to the north wall.  Head
down the ladder and then up the ladder to the west.  Keep going west along the
northern ledge until you get near the Djinn.  He'll run away, and you'll have
to keep going around the corner until you get to a movable stump with a crevice
on the side of the ledge.  Push the stump down the crevice, then go down the
crevice yourself.  Head down the ladder and freeze the puddle a little east of
the ladder.  Head back up the ladder and jump across the pillars and go north
along this ledge.  Here you will find Chest 2.  Keep going north and the Djinn
will flee.  Push the stump to the right and go up the ladder.  Go east to find
the Djinn in the northeast corner.  He'll flee once more, and you should go
down the large ladder and up the smaller one.  Head south, then jump across the
two stumps you had moved earlier and go up the ladder.  Go directly south of
the Djinn (there will be a block in your way) and use Halt on it.  You can now
go up to it and get the Venus Djinn Bane!  Jeez, that was pretty complicated.
CHEST 2:
Location: Go up the northern ledge towards the second location of the Djinn
(see Djinn step.)
Item: 666 coins (how evil)
Directions: See Djinn Directions.
CHEST 3: (Get the Djinn before doing this, but don't go out of the door)
Location: The middle of the screen on top of a stump.
Item: Demon Axe
Directions: Go to the middle of the screen without climbing up any ladders and
push the stump with the chest on top of it as far north as it will go (make
sure it's still in the center.)  Now, head back south and go up the ladder on
the east.  Hop across the two stumps you had moved earlier and start heading
north.  When you get to a small ladder, head down it and go up the large ladder
to the west of it.  Go west past the large ladder until you get to a small
ladder.  Go down this ladder and push the stump to the east.  Climb down the
ladder and Move the log all of the way to the east.  Go back up the two smaller
ladders and then go down the large ladder.  Hop from the stump onto the ledge
in the middle and get the Chest.
Notes: None.
CHEST 4:
Location: Middle-southern part of the screen.
Item: Water of Life
Directions: From Chest 3, head back to the stump and up the large ladder. 
Then, go down one small ladder but not the other and start heading south.  Keep
going until you reach the Ice Pillar that you freezed, and hop across that to
the stump and then down the ladder.  Now, move the stump all of the way to the
east.  However, before moving it into its final position north, you'll have to
get north of it and use Move Psynergy so that you don't get trapped behind it. 
Head back up north and go up the small ladder.  Then, head south and jump from
the ice pillar to the stump to the next platform.  The treasure chest is right
on top of here.
Notes: None.

To get out to the level (these directions are from after getting Chest 4) head
back across the two pillars and start going north.  Head down the small ladder
when you get to it and go south until you reach the stump that you had moved to
get Chest 4.  Use Move Psynergy to move this south and then west.  Keep heading
south to find your way out of the door.

-Floor 7-

At the door this time will be two Earth Lizards.  This time, for a change, try
activating all of your Djinn to have your stats boosted up a *ton*.  Use
Ragnarok with Isaac, Attack and Impair with Garet, Plasma and High Impact with
Garet and Wish Well with Mia.  It will take a lot longer but there's less risk
of a character going down thanks to more health and more defense.  When you
eventually defeat them you'll get some Water of Life and access to the next
room.

CHEST 1:
Location: Northeast part of the screen.
Item: Lucky Medal.
Directions: Head northeast along the hallway and across the gap to the west
when you get to it.  Keep going west until you reach a small block that you'll
have to move all the way to the right and then all of the way north.  Now, use
the Carry Psynergy that you got in Venus Lighthouse to place to block 1 square
north on the ledge.  Now, climb up the ladder and keep going east until you
reach the chest.
Notes: Head out of the room before attempting Chest 2.
CHEST 2:
Location: North-center part of the screen up on a large single platform.
Item: Psy Crystal
Directions: Head back to where that small block was when obtaining Chest 1. 
This time, move the block all of the way to the left without changing its
vertical position, and use Carry on it to bring it up the ledge to the left. 
Now, jump the gap and head up the ladder and down the one to the east of it. 
Move the block one square to the north and use Carry on it to move it up to the
ledge above.  Head back up the ladder and jump to the pillar you just made to
get the chest.
Notes: Head out of the room before attempting Chest 3.
CHEST 3:
Location: Almost dead center portion of the screen.
Item: Wicked Mace
Directions: Head back to where that small block was
in getting the previous chests.  Move it west just like you did in getting
Chest 2 and Carry it onto the ledge.  Hop the gap and go up the large ladder
and then down the small one.  Move the block all of the way to the left of the
platform and push it off.  Now, move the block so that it is 2 squares to the
left of the bottom most square of the ledge.  Now, go up the large ladder and
down the small one and jump across the small pillar to the platform against the
west wall.  Head southeast on this platform to get the chest.
Notes: None.
CHEST 4:
Location: East of the exit door.
Item: 777 Coins
Directions: Thanks to Peter Mentink for this information: It's real easy, you
can just jump on the ledge where the chest is (jump below the chest).The square
you jump to is only not visible because off the walls!
Notes: None.

From Chest 3 head back across the gap and up and then down the large ladder. 
Jump across the gap and start heading south at the narrow passageway.  Hop to
the west when you come to the end of this platform to find another small block.
 Move this down as far as it will go and then all of the way to the left.  Use
Carry to place this block on the ledge to the north of it, then climb up the
ladder and hop across the gap.  Head down the ladder to the west and go south
to go out of the door.

-Floor 8-

The next group of enemies are a Poison Toad, and two Thunder Lizards.  These
guys are pretty tough because they have the ability to stun your entire party
which wont' allow them to attack.  I'd go into this with 4 of each type of
Djinn on standby with the rest of the active.  This is a compromise between
stats and having Summons (although you may want to keep all of Mia's Djinn
active for Wish Well).  Three Level-4 summons will take care of the Thunder
Lizards, leaving only the Poison Toad.  Here you will probably want to use
status changing Djinn that will paralyze or put Poison Toad to sleep.  Once
he's injured, blast the hell out of it with regular attacks to defat it.  On
defeating the group you'll earn some Water of Life.  If you're running low on
PP, instead of wasting Psy Crystals, just run around for a while to restore PP
(you don't have to worry about random battles.)

CHEST 1:
Location: Northeast part of the screen.
Item: Smoke Bomb.
Directions: Head north along the hallway until you reach a white platform with
a puddle of water underneath it.  Freeze this puddle and head north up the
ladder.  Once you're up on the cliff, head south to get the chest.
Notes: None.
CHEST 2:
Location: North-Center part of the screen.  This chest is the top one.
Item: 888 coins.
Directions: From Chest 1 head down the ladder and freeze the puddle in your
way.  Now, head back north and up the ladder.  Cross the gap to be right next
to this chest.
Notes: Head out of the room before attempting Chest 3.
CHEST 3:
Location: Directly below Chest 2.
Item: Cleric's Ring
Directions: Make your way to Chest 2, freezing the puddle south of the ladder
leading up to the cliff on the east.  Do *not* freeze the puddle under the
platform or you'll have to start over.  From Chest 2, slide down the crevice on
the side of the mountain and make your way around the logs so that you can now
push the small black rock east.  Do so, then head up the ladder northwest of it
and back across the gap towards the dragon.  Head down the crevice, push the
horizontal log down, and freeze the puddle under the white platform.  This will
now have the dragon burn down the ice pillar in your way to the ladder to the
north, so hop across the puddle and refreeze it when you're north of it.  Head
up the ladder and across the gap.  Head down the crevice on this cliff and push
the horizontal log down.  You can now get up the ladder and get the chest.
Notes: None.
CHEST 4:
Location: Along the northwest wall.
Item: Potion.
Directions: From Chest 3, head down the ladder and head northwest.  Hop over
the puddle, then freeze it and go up the ladder.  Jump across the ice pillar to
the cliff to get the item.
Notes: None.

After you get the 4th Chest, head down the crevice and go out of the room via
the door to the south.

-Floor 9-

The door enemies for this floor are two Cerebuses.  Go into the battle with 4
inactive Djinn for Isaac, Garet and Ivan and all of the Djinn active for Mia. 
Cast all of the summons for Isaac, Garet and Ivan in the first round.  Have Mia
use Wish or Wish Well throughout the battle.  Once the summons have been cast,
have Isaac start to use Ragnarok, have Garet use the Djinni Flash or re-summon
Flash, and have Ivan use High-Impact then Plasma in the following rounds. 
Defeat them to get a handy Psy Crystal.

CHEST 1:
Location: East-center part of the screen in the middle of the lake.
Item: 999 Coins
Directions: Head north to get to the lake with many logs to cross.  Take the
horizontal log to the west of the lake up north.  Now, take the vertical log
right above it to the east.  Head off onto the eastern ledge and head south. 
Take the horizontal log here up north, then hop east to the double vertical
logs.  Head down to the south and take the vertical log in the southeastern
corner of the lake west to reach the island in the center.
Notes: Head out of the room before attempting to get the next Chest.
CHEST 2:
Location: Northwestern part of the lake.
Item: Sleep bomb.
Directions: Head up the eastern ledge of the lake and take the northern most
vertical log west.  Hop north to get the treasure chest.
Notes: Head out the room before attempting to get the next chest.
CHEST 3:
Location: Middle of the room in between the two lakes.
Item: Water of Life
Directions: Take the western most horizontal log in the first lake you come to
north, then take the vertical log above it east.  Head onto the cliff on the
east and head south.  Bring the horizontal log here north, then hop east to the
vertical log.  Move that west, then hop south to the vertical log below it. 
Head all of the way to the west to reach the platform with this treasure chest
on it.
Notes: None.
CHEST 4:
Location: Northwest past of the screen.
Item: Muramasa (a sword)
Directions: From Chest 3, head southwest.  Take all of the horizontal logs
north.  Now, go and take the lowest vertical log west, and then take the
horizontal log above it south.  Go back and take the middle Vertical log west,
then take the horizontal log above that south.  Go all the way back from whence
you came (13) and take the final vertical log at the northern part of the
screen west.  Jump up north to get the item.

From Chest 4, simply take the vertical log back east and head south down the
ledge to find the exit door.

-Floor 10-

When you get to floor ten, you'll be thrilled to know that there are no longer
anymore puzzles to solve.  However, you're about to face one mother of a boss. 
Save your game, inactivate 4 Djinn for everyone but Mia, and make sure
everyone's healed.  It's time for the battle of your life (you meaning Isaac
and company.)  Head west up the dock to find a treasure chest.  This chest is
actually a mimic that you may want to fight for the experience.  Now, head up
the deck the ship (to the north) to encounter Deathbeard in a random battle.

If you're around level 25-26 and have at least 6 Djinn for each character (If
you've been following this walkthrough you should by now), then Deathbeard
shouldn't be that difficult of an enemy.  In the first round, Cast your three
Level-4 summons on him, and have Mia use Wish Well on the whole party.  Once
the first round is done, start using Ragnarok with Isaac.  With Garet you'll
want to use the Djinn Flash *each* turn whether you're casting him or setting
him to be active again.  This will provide a heat barrier that frees your party
from almost all damage that Deathbeard dishes out.  With Ivan, use his Impact
spell on Isaac (you'll pretty much use this throughout the whole match because
Deathbeard will occasionally use Break which will decrease all of your party
member's stats down to normal.)  With Mia use Ply Well throughout the battle to
keep healing stats.  Whenever someone's PP starts to get down, use a Psy
Crystal on him or her (you'll only had to use about 2 or 3 throughout the whole
match...when Ivan's PP starts to get low don't worry about it, just have him
defend or use his Djinn.)  Try to time using Psy Crystals to when you're being
defended by a Flash heat barrier.  Also, whenever a character goes down, wait
until you're under a Flash heat barrier to revive that character with Isaac's
revive.  While this strategy is pretty boring, you should be able to defeat
Deathbeard in about 10 minutes.  This strategy works because you'll have a lot
of HP, PP and defense thanks to having lots of Djinn active.  When you finally
defeat Deathbeard you will get 8,000 experience points, 9,000 coins and some
Water of Life.  You'll also be able to get the treasure chest at the very north
part of the ship.  This box contains the Demon Mail that's unfortunately
cursed.

Congratulations!  You're now done Crossbone Island!  Save your game and use
Retreat to head out of the cave.  Head back northwest towards the pink tornado
to arrive back at Suhulla.  Head all of the way back to Babi's tower where you
want to go through the entrance there.  Also, you will probably want to take a
rest in the inn at Lalivero before you enter the tower.

------
Venus Lighthouse Part 3
------

Go through the Babi Lighthouse entrance to the tower.  Now, keep making your
way through the tower using the guide earlier in this game.  For the most part,
you're going to have to re-do all of the puzzles in the tower.  When you
*finally* make your way to the top room, save your game, heal all of your
characters and grab the Psy Crystal.  Put 4 Djinn on standby for everyone but
Mia just like you did with Deathbeard, and slide down the crevice.

You'll now get an elevator ride up to the top of the lighthouse where you'll
find Menardi and Saturos talking about lighting the beacon.  Suddenly, Felix
will come up and get in a fight with Saturous and Menardi.  He talks about how
he doesn't trust them with Sheba (remember her?)  When you finally get your
command back, SAVE YOUR GAME BUT WITH A DIFFERENT SAVE FILE THAN THE ONE YOU
SAVED BEFORE GOING DOWN THE CREVICE!  You will not be able to return to the
rest of the game without losing to Saturos and Menardi after this point.  Make
any final adjustments and head over the blue and white gaps, up the stairs and
get ready to find Saturos and Menardi!  Well, after 3 minutes of conversation
at least ;-]

In this battle, don't be afraid to use any valuable items that you may be
saving, as this is the final battle.  Cast all of your summons at the beginning
and have Mia use Wish Well throughout the battle.  You're the most vulnerable
at the beginning of this battle because characters such as Ivan will have very
little HP until he regains some of his HP.  If he goes down at any point, use
Water of Life or Revive with Isaac to bring him back to life.  Otherwise, use
Ragnarok with Ivan, Flash each turn with Garet (be it summoning or using), and
High Impact and Ivan's most expensive attack PP wise for each round.  Saturos
and Menardi will start to become less and less effective against you, and
eventually you'll destroy them.

Once Saturos and Menardi go down, Felix will mysteriously not let Sheba go and
mention that he himself wants to light all of the towers.  Then, out of
nowhere, Saturos and Menardi will get up and throw an elemental stone into the
tower.  Felix will leave and Saturos and Menardi will merge into one GIANT
Fusion Dragon.  This Fusion Dragon really isn't as difficult as it seems, and
the same strategy that you used against Saturos and Menardi will work very well
against this boss.  The only problem is that you don't have any Summons this
time, so it will take much longer to kill this guy.  After about 20 minutes of
fighting you'll finally be able to defeat the dragon if you've stuck to the
strategy.  Saturos and Menardi will fall into the Lighthouse (not much of a
death, I bet they'll be back.)  You'll talk with Felix again and suddenly the
Lighthouse will break in half.  Sheba will fall to here death and Felix will
jump after her.

------
Ending
------

You'll find yourself somewhere in Lalivero talking with Iodem.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!Absolutey Do Not Save Over Your Pre-Boss Battle File While In Lalivero!
!It is not possible to get out of Lalivero at this point.              !
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In here you'll learn that Sheba and Jenna have not been found, and that Idejema
has been washed out to see along with Sheba and the rest (apparently Sheba
didn't die.)  You'll all say your farewells, although Iodem will want to talk
to you a little more.  Head out of the house to have Iodem come and talk to you
about how you saw Iodem.  He'll give you the Black Orb that has the power to
raise the sunken ship from the sea.  Once you get command back, head to the
northwest part of the town to the building where the soldier is guarding.  Talk
to him and he'll let you through.  Head west along the bottom ledge and north
along the dock.  Use the Black Orb when you get to the northern most part of
the dock to raise the Ship from the sea.  Your friends will start talking about
how this is the Lemurian Ship and that the quests are just beginning.  The ship
will set sail and the credits will start to roll.  Once they're all done a To
Be Continued message will appear.  What does this mean?  It means that another
Golden Sun is on the way for GameBoy Advance and it's coming out by Christmas
2002.

But it doesn't end quite there.  After this you will see a short cinematic
scene which explains what happened to Sheba, Felix, Kraden, Jenna and Alex. 
Makes you thristy for a sequel, doesn't it?

=============
Chapter 7: Boss Strategies
=============

This section features alternate strategies than are listed in the walkthrough,
and also features Boss HP, how many coins they give, and how much experience
points they give.  If you've got a very well described Boss Strategy, please
send it to me at gsa@comicsoft.zzn.com or post them at my forums at
http://www.nin-gaming.com/~comicsoft/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi.  Also, if
you have stats on bosses, please also send them to me ASAP.  Those who
contribute will be credited.

Here's a general strategy from Tim Stankiss [jedimstr@sdf.lonestar.org]:
"I found that a really easy way to beat the most bosses *excluding* saturos,
menardi, and the fusion dragon is to equip all venus djinn on Issac (or
whatever you named him).  You get a power called curse that makes the spirit of
death embrace somebody.  After the spirit of death embraces somebody, they have

From MysticDragon2100: These guys give 66 EXP and 127 Gold.

------
Tret Tree
------

From Ben Rechter [weirdo007@hotmail.com]:
"This guy isn't that tough, so it doesn't really matter if you do him before or
after the Mercury Lighthouse.
Tret will just do a normal hit attack, while you can use your Psynergy. If
you're going well around this time, Isaac should have Ragnarok, which will be
useful. If Mia has enough Water Djinn, then she should be able to use Wish.
Ivan's best attack at this stage would be Plasma, so use that and with Garet
use Heat Wave."

------
Saturos on Top of Mercury Lighthouse
------

Here is Saturos' breakdown of stats:


From lotaion on the GameFAQ's message boards:
"Make sure that you have all of the Djinn up to this point, and that you're
around Level 10.  Keep all of your characters healed by distributing herbs and
nuts evenly to all characters.  Take in mind that Mia has slow agility and let
Isaac do some healing work.  Put all of your Djinni on standby and unleash the
summons.  Then use attacking Djinn like Gust, Flint and Fever.
As for attacks don't use any Psynergy with Garet, and with Ivan use Plasma."
From Flumens on the GameFAQs message boards:
"Saturos is easy this fight. Have all your Mars Djinn on Isaac (stand-by), all
your Jupiter Djinn on Garet (set), all your Venus Djinn on Ivan, and all your
Mercury Djinn on Mia. This way, Isaac and Ivan both have Cure and Mia has her
ply, making recovering from Saturos' Fireball easier. Attack with everybody
each turn with Garet using his Djinn and summoning them when they are all on
stand-by. When HP is low, cure, but be careful not to let anybody's HP drop too
low as a Fireball will finish them off. The best bet is to use Mia's Ply every
single turn. As she recovers 4 PP every turn anyway, she will never run out. If
no one was hurt, I generally healed Ivan as he is always hit by the Fireball,
and since Mia was slower than Saturos (can't remember agility or level), she
would heal after the fireball, reducing the number of people I had to heal next
turn. Healing all the time is a bit slow, but it encourages survival. Garet
should attack every turn regardless."
From Aethereal on the GameFAQs message boards:
"I beat him rather easily by equipping (and setting) the Djinni that match the
characters (i.e. Flint and Granite on Isaac, Forge and Fever on Garet, etc.). I
started by having Isaac, Garet, and Ivan cast their Assist Djinni (Granite for
defense, Forge for attack, and Breeze for resistance) and Mia used Sleet,
dealing the first dose of damage. Then I used the attacking Djinni and used
Fizz on Ivan, and always Ivan (because Saturos always does Heat Flash and then
Fireball on the first two turns). After that, unless someone was *really* about
to die (i.e. had less than 35 HP), I had everyone summon. Then I focused on
healing and casting spells such as Spire (I had yet to acquire Ragnarok by this
battle), Tundra, Plasma, and having Garet attack and use items...Mia and Isaac
assisted with the healing as well. I found the fight pretty easy as long as
Saturos didn't attack Ivan practically every round :)"

------
Hydros Statue
------

From Ben Rechter [weirdo007@hotmail.com]:
"By now, you should have at least two of Each Djinni, so use your summons-
Neried, Ramses, Tiamat and Atlanta. If that doesn't work, then keep using
Ragnarok, Heat wave, impact and taundra. After a while he should die so that
you can get the Lift Stone."

------
Manticore
------

From Ben Rechter [weirdo007@hotmail.com]:
"This guy shouldn't be too hard if you have done enough training up to here. In
the Lamakan Desert, use Reveal on the big Sand Fall and the Manticore
will be blocking a cave. Press A on it to get started.
With Ivan use Storm Ray, Ragnarok with Isaac, Ice Horn with Mia and Heat
Wave with Garet. If you want, using Summons could also be useful."

------
Kraken
------

Here's some information on Krarken from Aditya Durgam [adurgam777@hotmail.com]:
"I have some info on the HP power of Kraken, the water demon you encounter on
your way to Tolbi on the ship. Kraken is the fourth monster/ beast you
encounter while sailing.
-He knows Ply Well, so be carefully.
-He has approx. 2447 HP. It would be best if you used all the appropriate
summons with the respective elemental adept (Thor with Ivan, Judgment with
Isaac, etc.). I works better that way (duh)."

------
Toadonpa
------

From Dumont [ajdumont@sympatico.ca]:
Toadonpa has approx. 3500 HP.

------
Storm Lizard
------

Jarrod M: "If you want to get rid of the storm lizard quickly all you need to
do is go to Tolbi and use your lucky medals and aim for the center you'll
usually get a weapon called the "Assassin Blade" it's special abilities can
kill enemy even at full HP then get 3 of these and just go and fight him if
your lucky you can kill him in one hit with one of the blades although it may
be a glitch i couldn't tell you for sure."

------
Deathbeard
------

Here is information from Ben Rechter [weirdo007@hotmail.com]:
"When you find the pirate ship, go to the front of the ship and Deadbeard
will appear.
The best attacks to use are Destruct Ray with Ivan (though if you don't have
it use Tornado or Shine Plasma). With Isaac use your Ragnarok. Every turn with
Mia it would be safe to use Wish or Wish Well. With Garet
use Heat Wave.
Deadbeard will attack you will fire attacks like Fireball and Inferno.
Although if you use High Impact with Ivan about 3 times, he will use Break.
Deadbeard is and extremely tough boss, so i suggest you take a few nuts, Psy
Crystals, Water of Hermes and always try to keep Mia and Isaac alive- Isaac
to attack and Mia to heal. It could be an extremely long fight, so be
prepared."
Here's some information from UnrealBlizzard@aol.com:
"i have some info on deadbeard on Crossbone Island. When i fough him, my
characters were at level 28 (Ivan was 27). He had approxamately 6023 HP and he
liked to use Impact and Break. All my characters fell except for Mia, and i
killed him when she had 27 HP left. I just summoned the hell out of him and
then used Ragnorak with Isaac, Heat Wave and Djinni with Garet, Djinni with
Ivan, and Wish Well with Mia. Watch out, because, like most bosses, Deadbeard
attacks twice per round."

From "Chris Pestak" <cpestak@core.com>:
"When I fought deathbeard I used wishwell almost every turn with either my
dragoon Garet at lv 30 or White Mage Ivan. Issac's Samurai attacks are good and
don't be afraid to use his status-changing Psyenergy. The ultimate weapon,
however, against Deathbeard is by far and away Earth Summons. Regular old
'VENUS' will do between 200-300 damage. I did over 1000 damage with Judgement.
I had Mia doing the summoning just because the other characters were busy
attacking or wishing in the well. Good Luck!"
------
Saturos, Menardi, Fusion Dragon
------

According to RaGiNGTDRaGoN@aol.com, The Fusion Dragon has between 5200-5300 HP.

From Paratroopa1 on the GameFAQ's message boards:
"With Ivan, do whatever you want. Some people like to use Impact on Isaac.
Myself, I prefer to use a lot of Djinni and then summon Thor to get a lot of
damage done.
Isaac should attack with the Gaia Blade, use Ragnarok, or use Djinni and then
Summon. Don't use Djinni too often or his stats will fall. Be careful."

From TennisPro6988@aol.com:
"Start out with all the earth Djinni on Isaac, all the Fire Djinni on Garet,
etc. Go into battle and use all the defensive djinni first. The main thing in
this fight is to get rid of Saturos. His attacks will do at least 100 to all
your people, while Menardi just heals and does 40 damage (if your level 25). So
keep on using your Djinni's special abilities until you finally have enough on
standby to use four level 4 summons. Remember to concentrate the attack on
Saturos. A few more attacks after that and he should go down. Now you just have
to deal with Menardi. She won't have that much HP(because of the summons you
used) so just do regular attacks and remember to heal. After that you get
really happy and say " Yay I finally beat the game!"........ NO. just NO. Your
characters will get happy to until suddenly Saturos lights the light house(
c'mon you knew it was gonna happen) Then somehow him and Mernardi fuse into a
big ugly rabid Dragon. Just use the same tactics and you should beat him."

From Syk0224@aol.com:
"This may vary from other people's strategies, but when I used this one, I beat
it easily:
First off, put all the djinn on standby, except for Granite, Flash, and any
other djinn you would like to use in battle. (only set up to 3 djinn for each
person, because the summon would be weakened, if you have all of them--28 djinn
total). Then, in the first round of attacks, use Granite and Flash. Then, tell
Ivan to use djinn or summon Thor. Definitely, and I mean DEFINITELY, summon
Boreas.
Second round of attacks
Tell Isaac to heal whoever needs healing, (Probably Ivan.) Garet--Summon
Meteor. Ivan--summon Thor or cast most powerful spells. Mia--aid in healing.
Third round of attacks
Tell Isaac to continue healing, but if everyone has enough HP, summon Judgment.
(And no, judgment is not spelled wrong!!) Garet--Same as b4. Ivan--Cast most
powerful spell. Mia--if has enough djinn, use Wish or Wish Well on party often.
Fourth round of attacks, and so on (press A and watch the pretty colors)
OK, now you have it sort of easy, unless the dragon keeps using Outer Space.
Isaac--Use djinn often to put in Standby, and cast most powerful spells.
Garet--Same as Isaac.
Ivan--Same as Isaac.
Mia--Use Wish Well often, cast most powerful spells.
Last few attacks
Now, you should be low on PP. Use the items to regain PP. Everyone should do
the same things as before, and if a lot of the djinn are on Standby, SUMMON!!
The Fusion Dragon should collapse soon, and watch the close-to-ending
cinematics...
"

From Ben Rechter [weirdo007@hotmail.com]:
"Use Level 4 summons first of all. With Mia use a level 3 so that she can
still do Wish Well. After Summons have been done, use your Djinni to hold
Saturos because he is the stronger fighter although Menardi has more health.
Use your strongest attacks (like Destruct Ray, Galcier, Inferno, Mother
Gaia) until they die.
Now the fusion dragon isnt much stronger than Menardi and Saturos, but this
time it should be easier because u can use stron ger attacks like Ragnarok
and Heat Wave. Don't worry if Isaac and Garet are on low pp after fighting
Saturos and Menardi, their pp will get restored. Keep fighting, using High
Impact with Ivan and Wish Well with Mia. After dieing, Saturos and Menardi
will fall into the lighthouse, which probably means that they will come
back, Felix and Sheba will fall into the sea and the lighthouse will split."

From HiddenFlame@aol.com:
"1st, before entereing the battle make sure everyone is at full HP and PP. The
set all of your Djinn except Ground(On Isaac) and Flash(On Garet). When you
start off send all damage to Menardi with this combo: summon Judgement with
Isaac, use the Flash Djinn with Garet, then Thor with Ivan, and Boreas with
Mia. On the second go round, use the Ground Djinn with Isaac on Saturos, then
Meteor with Garet but with it directed at Saturos, summon Procne with Ivan
directed at Menardi, and Neptune with Mia directed at Menardi. This second
round combo should fell Menardi if you're on a high enough level, and/or have
all Djinn set to the users by type. On the third round, use Ragnarok w/ Isaac,
then Inferno or set Flash w/ Garet, then Destruct Ray w/ Ivan, and anything you
want with Mia. With that, they should have beaten and you hadn't taken any real
damage. "

From "Bonnizzio" <hbonnizzio@qwest.net>:
"I found an easy (but long) way to defeat the 3 final bosses. Just equip all
the Djinn the characters are good at. Isaac= 7 Venus, Garet= 7 Mars, Ivan= 7
Jupiter, Mia= 7 Mercury. Put them all on stanby except Granite, Corona, Flash,
Kite, Zephyr, Fizz, and Spritz. As soon as you start battling the duo, have
Isaac unleash Granite, Garet summon Meteor, Ivan summon Thor, and Mia summon
Boreas. Make surem the larger arrow is on Menardi. After the duo attacks, have
Isaac summon Judgment, Garet unleash Flash, Ivan unleash Kite*, and Mia unleash
Spritz. After the duo attacks, have Isaac cast Ragnarok or Clay Spire, then the
other I just mentioned. After this, just unleash any Djiini that are
status-changing or attacking. Have Mia summon Mercury, Neried, Neptune, or
Boreas whenever possible. This should also get Fusion Dragon after about 5-10
minutes of battling."

=============
Chapter 8: The Arena
=============

The Arena in Golden Sun has a handful of uses.  To get to it, choose Battle
instead of the usual Load Saved Game when you press A from the Main Menu
screen.  In this mode you'll notice that you can use your "Clear Data" file
that contains the save you made once you beat the game if you have one (this
leads me to believe that you will be transferring your data via a link cable as
opposed to another method.)

When you select a file to load you'll find yourself in the lobby area.  You'll
notice that in this lobby none of your Psynergy works, but this doesn't matter
because there won't be any monsters or puzzles to fight in the lobby.  You also
won't take home any experience points, items or health that you may get as a
result of fighting in the Lobby.  The Lobby is more of just a practice area
where you can battle other monsters or a friend.  So, you want to head to the
girl at the counter north-northwest of the door to set up either a Monster
Battle (single player) or a Linked Battle against another player.

------
Monster Battles
------

Talk with the lady at the counter and step onto the circle in the middle of the
two desks.  In here the bars to the stairs will open and you'll start to head
up it.  These monster battles won't give you any experience points, but they
can be reasonably fun.  In here you'll find any monster or monster-type boss
that you've already faced in the save file you have loaded.  When you defeat a
monster you'll arrive back in the circle in the Lobby and you'll be asked if
you want to fight another battle.  You won't have time to change around Djinn,
so make sure that you stick with a solid plan before staring your first monster
battle.  Take note, however, that if you quit your consecutive monster battle
tally will be stopped and you'll have to start over again.

If you've beaten the game expect to see several odd monsters that you usually
aren't used to seeing in regular random encounters.  Some of these monsters
include Bosses, Mimics and tough monsters from Crossbone Island.  If you're
struggling to defeat some of these monsters, try leveling up in one of your
games, saving it, and then playing again.  This should make monster battles a
lot easier.

The Monster Battle Consecutive Win Record doesn't seem to affect anything in
the game, although I could be mistaken.  Has anyone gotten anything special by
winning a *lot* of monster battles in a row?  If so, e-mail me at
gsa@comicsoft.zzn.com

------
Linked Battles
------

Linked Battles are probably the best part of Golden Sun once you've beaten the
game.  They offer a great deal of challenge (pending that you can actually find
a friend with another Game Boy Advance and who has this game) and are generally
very exciting.  Before I go into strategies, here is some general information
on Linked Battles
ïThe 3 left-most characters will participate in the battle.  To change the
order of the characters, go to Status, and press L and R to swap around
character order.
ïTalk with the lady at the counter when linked to propose a linked battle, then
talk with her again once your friend accepts your offer.  Next, head into the
white circle to enter the arena.
ïIn the battle you will have as long as your rival takes to make his or her
move and 15 seconds afterwards.  If you fail to choose a command for any
character before the clock runs out, those characters will be assigned to
defend.
ïFeel free to use any items in the battle as these won't transfer over to your
normal game (read: you won't lose your items that you consumed in the battle.)
ïAgree with your friend to OUTLAW PSY CRYSTALS.  This is for the best because
if both you and your friend are at high levels and have many Psy Crystals the
battles will go on for a *long* time.

Now, here are a few strategies for Linked Battles:
ïTurn your sound all of the way down, even before the battle.  This will
prevent your friend from listening in on what you're doing and planning a
counter strike against you.  Alternatively, if you hear your friend
inactivating all of his or her Djinn, be prepared for an onslaught of summons
at the beginning of the battle.
ïIn your first battle, put enough Djinn on standby so that you have 3 Level-4
Summons.  Unleash these your first time to catch your friend off guard.
ïIn the remaining battles, don't try the same Summon-First strategy for a
while.  Instead, try faking your friend out by turning up your volume before
the battle and having him listen to your putting all of your Djinn on standby. 
Then, as soon as the battle begins, simply do stat boosting spells while your
friend uses his defensive Djinn, etc.  If it works you should be able to catch
him or her off guard in the next round and blast him with summons.
ïEven if you're going for a normal battle, you will probably want to have at
least 1 Level-4 summon handy.  These will do 200-350 damage against your
opponent which is a sure-fire way to hurt him when he's down.  Since the
battles are usually long, you should be able to get back the stats by regaining
Djinn after casting the summon any ways.
ïDjinn like Kite and Flash are your friends during this battle.  Make sure that
you have these Djinn active at all times.
ïI like Mia over Ivan, but you may have your own preference.
ïThe Spell "Break" is one of the best spells in this battle.  If your friend
spends all of his time boosting his stats, simply cast 1 Break spell on him to
return his stats back to normal.

=============
Chapter 9: Leveling and Character Classes
=============

This section is for those who like to level up at the end of games for not much
reason at all (although, with a sequel on the horizon it may be of some use.) 
It also will provide help to finding the best Djinn combinations to fit your
needs.  any ways, in this section I will hope to cover all Attacks gained by
characters in their various classes.  This will take a very long time, so bare
with me as this section is updated quite slowly.

Here are a few pointers for use when leveling up:  The fastest way to level up
is to have all of your Djinn Active so that they have the best stats.  This
seems to require less experience points to get to the next level than when you
don't have your Djinn active.  Naturally, you should have the Lure Cap that you
got from Babi after winning Collosso.  Here are a few other items that you want
to have equipped:
ïYour best equipment for all of the characters except...
ïAny equipment that replenishes PP for the character with Wish Well

Here's a general break down of class changing:
ïThe best Djinn combinations seem to be with all of one type of Djinn early on
in the game.
ïCharacters are a little stronger with their class of Djinn as opposed to
another class (for example: Isaac is best with Earth Djinn)
ïCharacters are by far much better when they have all of their Djinn equipped
as opposed to when they don't have any Djinn equipped.
ïCombinations that mix up many Djinn aren't as strong as pure Djinn
combinations unless you have enough Djinn (which would be 7 of each type) to
get the Ninja, White Mage, etc. classes (see below.)
ïWhen leveling up try to have as much "Luck" as possible in order to get the
best items.
ïThe "Pink Tornado" strategy of attacking the Storm Lizard in the Pink Tornado
on Crossbone Island and then re-entering Crossbone Island's entrance and
fighting it again is not an effective strategy.  I recommend sticking to the
top floors of Venus Lighthouse.

New: If you're not at the end of the game, here's a method from Chris R.
(Wallkill, NY) for leveling up your characters:
Go to Altimer Cave (northwest of Tolbi, it's where you first find Babi).  In
Altimer Cave, walk around getting in battles until you encounter an enemy party
with atleast 1 Worm.  Kill all the of the enemies except the Worm and let it
start to call for help.  If a worm shows up, let it live.  However, if anything
but a worm is called kill it.  Ideally, you want worms in positions 1,2,5,6
(from left to right.)  Kill everything in the middle, repeating this for
several minutes.  You'll get about 9,000 expererience points if you keep it up
for 20 minutes with a good deal of coins.

The first section in this chapter deals with when characters learn their
Psynergy at their pure classes (only Earth Djinn on Isaac, only Fire on Garet,
etc.)  Most of the information is from Levatation 0 and Koop from my message
boards.  If you have something to add to this section, feel free to e-mail me
at gsa@comicsoft.zzn.com.

Here are a few suggestions for good classes for Mia from Rommel O Morales
[romax12@edsamail.com.ph]:
"Give Mia 6 Fire Djinn and 1 Water Djinn to have a Water Monk
Give Mia 6 Earth Djinn and 1 Water Djinn to have a Druid
Give Mia 6 Wind Djinn and 1 Water Djinn to have a Sage
Give Mia 6 Wind Djinn and 1 Fire/Earth or all Wind Djinn to have a Savant"

=============
Chapter 10: Weaknesses and the 'Dark Panther' Mehtod
=============

Before I get into the details, here is a breakdown of this section:  It has
been recently discovered by 'Dark Panther' on the GameFAQs.com Message Boards
that attacking enemies with the opposing Djinn types will generate at the very
least a special "flashing death" and more experience points.  Other players,
while not all, have found it also greatly increases the chance of recieving an
item dropped.

Now, the first section of this Chapter deals with how to execute the 'Dark
Panther' Method.  The next section lists a great deal of enemy weaknesses and
was created by Alex on the message boards at my site, Golden Sun Anonymous
(http://www.nin-gaming.com/~comicsoft/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi).

Now, here are the instructions for executing the 'Dark Panther' Method:
ïIf you're trying to get rare item drops on the top floors of Venus Lighthouse,
here's a method on how to have a greater chance on getting rares (note: This
method is not guaranteed to work):
ïGet into a random battle, making sure that you have all of your Djinn set. 
Instead of attacking like usual, simply use Attacking Djinni of the opposite
type of your enemy.  For example, if you're against a Fire (Mars) type enemy,
use Venus (Earth) type Djinn like Flint on the enemy.  Do not attack or use
Psynergy that will hurt the enemy (note: you can still use defensive Psynergy
and Djinn).  Once you've defeated the enemy, you should notice a series of
flashing colors (as seen at
http://www.nin-gaming.com/~comicsoft/gsa/FenrirColors.gif).  This means that
you did it correctly.
ïOnce you've defeated all of the enemies, you should notice that you've
obtained more experience points (this is guaranteed to happen.)
ïIf you're lucky, you will also have a good chance of recieving an item dropped
by the enemy.  However, this is not guaranteed to work.  For some unknown
reason, certain people get item after item after item, whilst (I said whilst)
others only recieve items very rarely, or not at all.

Here is a Weakness Guide by Alex from the message boards at my site, Golden Sun

Chapter 11: Golden Sun 2: The Lost Age

------
Information
------

It's impractical to update the whole guide every time new information from the
new Golden Sun game, the Lost Age, comes out.  So, I have put all of the
information, screenshots, movies and speculation on my site Golden Sun
Anonymous (http://goldensuna.tk).

------
Sending Data To the Lost Age
------

Here is how to send your data to the Lost Age.  Note: You will need a Clear
Data file that you get when you beat the game.  This DOES NOT mean an empty
slot for saving.

ïTurn on your GameBoy Advance with Golden Sun in it.
ïProceed to the menu where you choose to make a New
File/Save/Battle/Copy/Erase.
ïHold the Shoulder Buttons (L and R), Hold Left, press B once.  Note: You
should still be holding L, R and Left after pressing B.
ïThe menu will disapear for about a second.  When it reapears you can release
L, R, and Left.  You should now see an option to Send data if you were
successful.

In the Send option you will have the option of sending your Clear Data via a
link cable to another GameBoy Advance with the Lost Age in it or you can write
down a password.  The passwords go from Gold to Bronze, with Gold being the
longest and Bronze being the shortest.

=============
Chapter 12: Codes, Secrets and Tips
=============

Welcome to the Codes, Secrets and Tips section.  In this section are all of the
known codes, secrets and tips that I have for Golden Sun (hence the title of
this chapter.)

Name Other Party Members:
When you are naming your characters at the start of the game, press select
three times to name your other characters.

Name Enemies:
Source: midgetjackietran.
After pushing select three times, push up, down, up, down, left, right, left,
right, up, right, down, left, up, and select to name Felix, Jenna, and Sheba.

Restore HP Without Using Psynergy:
Thanks to Michael Sutton [suttmi@selwyn.ca] for this information:
"I have a good tip for when healing party members. For example, if Garet has
500/700 hp, you do not have to spend pp on curing 200 hp for him. Instead, you
just have to put all of his djinn on standby first and then his hp will be at a
lower number but with less damage. The percent of damage according to his hp
stays the same but it is a smaller number than the original number of hp
missing. This means that now instead of having to heal 200 hp you will only
have to heal about 100 hp. After he is healed, set back all of his djinn and he
will be at full health. So, you saved pp by only having to cure 100 hp instead
of 200 hp. You can do this for all party members. It is a way to save pp with
Mia or Isaac, but it does take a few minutes."

See Chapter 10, Weaknesses and the 'Dark Panther' Method, for a description of
a possible way to have better chances of getting rare item drops.

See Chapter 11, Golden Sun: The Lost Age, to see how to access the secret Send
Data mode.
