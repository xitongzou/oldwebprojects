<b>What if Napa had survived and left with Vegeta?  By:<a href="mailto:sss_vegetta@hotmail.com">jason liberty</a> </b>
<br>
Well Napa would leave and they would go to Nameck and try to find the 
dragonballs. Gohon, Krillin and Bulma would still go and fight the 2 
henchmen. Napa and Vegeta would kill Dadoria. Vegeta would still be able to 
sense power levels but not Napa. They would encounter Zabon and be beaten 
up. Then Zarbon would bring them back and they would excape and throw the 
dragonballs and then they kill Zarbon like it hapen in the seris. They would 
encounter Gohon and Krillin. All the dragonballs would be gathered and the 
gynu Force would show up and recoome would really beat everyone up Goku 
would show up and save everyone. Vegeta would sense Goku was a super sayain 
and tell Napa. Everything would happen like so But Freeza would kill Vegetta 
and Napa. They would be sent to Earth and they serch for Goku. They would 
train to gether and become super sayains and would return to earth and when 
Freeza shows up they go because being arrogant because they were super 
saiyans would loose to freeza and Trunks would save them and tell Goku about 
the Androids and give the heart medicine. Napa would come down with the 
heart diases and Goku would give it to  him. Trunks would come like usual 
and give Goku a spar aintodote and Vegeta and Napa would go into the 
r.o.s.t. Vegeta would be a little stronger in the cell games. Trunks 
wouldn't feel needed so he go back and fight androids for 2 more years. Napa 
would be killed by Cell and everything would go normaly but Vegetta is a bit 
stronger.

<b>What if Dr. Gero took on Vegeta after he killed Android 19? By:<a href="mailto:Jimster22@gateway.net ">Jimster22</a> </b>
<br>
Well, Vegeta would, of course start to finish him rather quickly.  He would 
probably disable him from the arms like he did with 19, and seeing this, Gero 
would flee but Vegeta would probably be able to kill him.  When Trunks 
arrives, Vegeta would brag about how easy the fights were, and Trunks, seeing 
the bodies (Or what is left of the bodies) would announce they were not the 
Androids of his period.  Bulma would then show up, and tell everyone that 20 
is actually Dr. Gero.  After thought, they would come to the conclusion  that 
the other Androids are probably in the laboratory.  So Vegeta would get 
excited about testing his strength on a worthy adversary, as usual, and fly 
off.  The others would try to get there first to stop him.  Vegeta would most 
likely get there first, and blast the doors away.  Trunks would arrive soon 
after, followed by the other Z Warriors.  Vegeta would see the Androids, and 
try to think of a way to get them out.  First, he would stumble on Android 
16, which he would open, and take on.  16, wanting only to fight Goku, would 
not attack, and Vegeta would probably annihilate him.   Trunks again tells 
him that that Android is not one from his time, and notices them.  When he 
does, so does Vegeta.  The other Warriors notice it too, and they all blast 
the chambers at the same time, which would blow the Androids up, considering 
they are not activated.  Vegeta would get mad, and everyone else would go 
check on Goku.  Goku would be able to stay at his house, since the Androids 
are not around.  Soon, Bulma would call about Cell, and they would eventually 
find him.  Since everyone is together, and Piccolo did not need to fuse with 
Kami, then Cell would be overmatched with everyone there.  He would probably 
explain his life story, and they would announce the Androids are dead and 
blow Cell up.  Goku would then quickly recover, and everything will be fine 
until the later series when no intense training would have happened for the 
Cell Games.  Everyone would most likely be absorbed by Buu, and he would be 
an almighty ruler.

<b>What If Trunks only gave the Z Warriors One Year to Train? By:<a href="mailto:Jimster22@gateway.net ">Jimster22</a> </b>
<br>
Well, let's start at Trunks' arrival.  When Frieza lands on earth with 
King Kold, the Z Warriors realize that Frieza is too strong.  They would get 
ready to take him on, but he would send out his elites to battle them.   
Krillin and Gohan could easily take control of the field with Piccolo, and 
Tien would also give some help.  Vegeta would say he won't waste his energy 
on such pathetic life forms, and he would wait to fight Frieza.  Yamcha would 
still be afraid, since he didn't want to fight, and Bulma would get board and 
have Yamcha take her away.  The henchman would be easily destroyed. <BR><BR>
    Meanwhile, in space, Goku would feel all of his friends energy, and 
figure he might as well lend a hand.  So he would go Super Saiyan, and begin 
to charge a Kamehameha.  He would then use Instant Transmission, much like he 
did against Cell later in the series.  <BR><BR> 
    Frieza would be toying with everyone, laughing and pushing them around.   
Vegeta would get mad and attack him.  Frieza would take him, but realize 
Vegeta's power had risen since there last encounter.  Frieza would jump up 
onto a cliff to charge a blast, and right before his eyes, Goku would appear 
with a huge beam in his palms.  He would yell "HA!" to finish the blast, and 
Frieza would freak.  He would yell out, and then explode.  Everyone would 
stare in awe at Goku, and he would move right up to King Kold.  Kold would be 
scared, now seeing the beater of his son in person.  Goku would push him to a 
cliff edge, and blast his ship.  Kold would go crazy, and begin to try an 
attack.  Goku would then blast him, and Kold would be gone.  Goku would 
explain how he escaped Namek, and trained on Yadrat.  <BR><BR> 
    Two years later, Trunks would seek out Goku at his house.  He would tell 
him of the Androids.  He would leave, and Goku would explain this to 
everyone.  They would intensely train, and Vegeta would go to space. <BR><BR>
    On the day of destiny, so to speak, they would travel to the island, and 
face the Androids.  Everyone would be worried about the amount of training 
time, but the series would go normally.  Goku's only weakness was against 
nineteen, where he probably quickly lose. He would be killed, since Vegeta 
would not have had enough time to perfect his Super Saiyan self.  Everyone 
would get scared, and eventually they would all be killed.  Gohan may 
survive, but soon Gero would awaken 17 and 18 to destroy Goku's son.  Gohan 
would die, and eventually, so would Trunks. <BR><BR>
    The entire Z Warriors would be destroyed, as would Kami, so the Dragon 
Balls would not be gathered.  When Cell arrives, he would absorb the 
Androids, and take over the world, and finally complete Dr. Gero's life long 
dream.

<b>What if Vegeta went SSJ2 when Trunks was killed? By:<a href="mailto:mewkorn@yahoo.com">Justin Delle Donne </a> </b>
<br>
First, when Cell regenerates himself after self-destructing, he shots a laser blast at Trunks who dies.  Vegeta feeling like he lose his son would feel the same rage that Goku felt when Krillin was killed by Frieza.  He would become a SSJ2 and decide to take on Cell himself.  After Fighting with Cell and probably beating him half to death he would than blast him with a massive Final Flash attack, and destroy Cell.  Then after he defeated Cell, the D-balls would be used to revive all those killed by Cell.  Now since there was peace on earth, Vegeta would continue to train with little Trunks to become stronger.  When the next world Tournament came he would enter just as everyone else and when he faced Goku it would either be a tie or vegeta would comeout on top.  Vegeta's strength would increase some much that he would go SSJ3 and so would Goku.  When Buu came into the mix Vegeta and Goku would attack Buu either by themselves or by fusing together to become Vegetto.

<b>What if Gohan Wouldn't have acted all macho and killed Cell when he had the 
chance? By:<a href="mailto:Jviper045@aol.com ">Jviper045@aol.com</a> </b>
<br>
This would have turned the rest of the series around Because Goku would have 
never died so he would have never went to king kais and blew up his planet.So 
therefore he would have never trained in Hell So he Wouldn"t have reached a 
higher level as soon as he did. The cameraman would have video taped gohan 
and would have shown the whole world Gohan Won so Mr.satan wouldnt have 
gotten all the hype andthen if goku would have stayed alive they all wouldnt 
ahve separted therefore focing at least one to two more sagas in the dbz 
series.

<b>What if yamcha was trunks' father instead of vegeta? By:<a href="mailto:Kakarot675@aol.com ">Kakarot675@aol.com </a> </b>
<br>
The Saiyan saga, Frieza, and Garlic Jr. would be the same. In his time 
line the androids would kill everyone except trunks, so he would try to fight 
the androids and lose. He would then leave back in time to warn them about 
the androids. The android saga would go normally, but in the cell saga when 
he comes back after he self-destructed at king kai's, he would kill trunks, 
but since he was not vegeta's son he would not go attack cell causing him to 
defeat gohan. All the other fighters would go fight cell and lose, 18 would 
do some damage to cell but not defeat him. He would know that all the 
fighters are gone and would probably blow up the earth, ending the series. .

<b>What if when Bulma hit Goku with her car in Dragonball#1 she killed him? By:<a href="mailto:mcinnis@comteck.com">Kay Mcinnis</a> </b>
<br>
Goku would be dead.Bulma would loot his house and steal the dragonball.
Vegeta would come years later after Raditz. Vegeta,Nappa,and Raditz would use the dragoballs to wish back King Vegeta. They Would all then find the Hyperbolic time chamber(room of spirit and time)and all become Super Saiyans, beat the snot out of Frieza and rule the galaxy.

<b> What if Goku never caught the heart virus? By:<a href="mailto: cookie@cybertours.com">Keith</a> </b>
<br>
Well first of all he would beat up 19 and eventually destroy him. 
20/Gero would be come scared and run to his lab.  Since they can't sense 
his ki he would make it and 17 would kill him like in the series.  Then 
Trunks and Goku would team up and try to blast the androids to pieces. 
They wouldn't be able to destroy them but they would badly damage them. 
Then they would release 16 and a big fight would ensue between Goku and 
16 and would be beaten up very badly due to him using so much ki during 
the fight with 19.  Just when 16 was about to kill him Vegeta would kick 
him and send him flying through a few mountains.  Vegeta would then try 
to fight him and fail to kill him.  Krillen would try to give Goku a 
senzu bean but 18 would kill him.  Goku would see this and power up SSJ2 
and kill 18 easily.  17 would become enraged and attack Goku but he 
would also be killed along with 16. <BR><BR>
    3 or 4 years later cell would emerge and begin to absorb people. 
Goku would fly off with Gohan, who would have become a super saiya-jin 
when Krillen was killed, and beat the snot out of Cell.  Cell would 
become scared and try to run away but would be destroyed by Gohan. <BR><BR>
    The rest of the years would pass as usual only with Goku still alive 
and Krillen wished back with the Namekian dragon balls.  Then the 
majin-buu saga would be the same.

<b>What if the Dragonballs didn't exist By:<a href="mailto:KIDMANIA22@aol.com">Kid Mania22</a>
</b>

<br>
There really wouldn't be any show because the idea of every villain is to get 
all the Dragonballs and wish for immortality. There would be cell and the 
androids because Dr. Gero wanted to destroy Goku not to get the Dragonballs 
but they wouldn't have met Vegeta and Trunks would be permanently dead. The 
real idea of the show is the Dragonballs not the villains because there would 
be no villains if there weren't for the dragonballs. 
But which came first the Dragonball or the villain because the villain comes 
for the Dragonball but the Dragonball Helps to get rid of the villain. You 
don't destroy what you create. hmmmmm?

<b>-NEW-DBZ What If Story- Saiyan Saga By:<a href="mailto:LeonFelips@aol.com ">LeonFelips</a>
</b>

<br>
What If's in the story: <BR>
1)Tien, Yamcha, Krillin, & Chiaotzu trained in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber to <BR>
prepare for Vegeta & Nappa. <BR>
2)Goku didn't fall of Snake Way. <BR>
3)King Kai taught Goku the Instant Transmission. <BR>
4)The Z Fighters knew the Fusion Dance. <BR>
5)Vegeta returned to Earth after getting healed up. <BR>
<BR><BR>


Since there is no What If for the Raditz battle in this story, lets go 
straight to Goku going on Snake Way. Goku just met up with Kami at the gate 
house of other world & he told Goku about King Kai, the great martial arts 
master. After Kami explained to King Yamma about how Goku needs to get King 
Kai's training to fight Vegeta & Nappa, Goku starts going down the million 
mile long Snake Way. After awhile running, Goku sees a street cleaner on 
Snake Way & asks the driver if he can hitch a ride to go to King Kai's 
planet. The driver says yes & Goku takes a rest. Back on Earth, Tien, 
Krillin, Yamcha, & Chiaotzu are training with Kami to prepare for the battle. 
Kami tells the Z Fighters about the Hyperbolic Time Chamber & how they can 
get 1 years worth of training in a single day. They all agree to go in, so 
Tien, Krillin, Yamcha, & Chiaotzu train in there for a day. Mean while, the 
street sweeper stops & tells Goku, "This as far I will go." Goku now is 
around a half  of the way there & he get to King Kai's planet in less than a 
week going at his max speed. Tien, Krillin, Yamcha, & Chiaotzu finished their 
training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber & their power levels would be like 
this: <BR><BR>
Tien-3,900 <BR>v
Krillin-3,700 <BR>
Yamcha-3,100 <BR>
Chiaotzu-2,945. <BR><BR>
Kami would mention the Fusion Dance to them & the Z Fighters were eager to 
learn it. Tien & Yamcha decide they want to use it, so Kami taught them how 
to the dance correctly. In about a day, Tien & Yamcha mastered it. When they 
did the Fusion Dance infront of the others, Krillin, Chiaotzu, & Yajirobe(who 
decided not to got the Hyperbolic Time Chamber) were amazed how strong the 
fusion was, around 7,000.  The fusion said his name was Tiencha.  After a 
half-a-hour, the fusion wore off & the Z Fighters got back to training. 
Finally after a month, Goku gets to King Kai's planet.  Goku meets King Kai & 
does all the training that he does in the series, which took him around 2 
weeks to do, & now there is around 44 days left until Vegeta & Nappa arrvive. 
King Kai mentions to Goku a move that will allow him to get to Earth a lot 
faster than flying, the Instant Transmission, but Goku could only get it if 
he goes through intense training. Goku says yes & starts the training.  The 
44 days have passed & Vegeta & Nappa show up & destroy the city their space 
pods landed in like in the series.  When the fighters on Kami's Lookout sense 
the Saiyans are here, they supress their power levels to around 1,000 each.   
Nappa sense 2 power levels, one 3,000, the other 2,000, which belong to Gohan 
& Piccolo.  Thinking these are the strongest fighters on Earth, the Saiyans 
fly off towards them. Tien, Krillin, Yamcha, & Chiaotzu leave Kami's Lookout 
& go to Gohan & Piccolo. They get there at the same time the Saiyans do & the 
battle begins. Nappa releases 7 Saibaimen to attack everyone. Everyone 
easally takes care of them, but Gohan got scared & was badly hurt. before the 
Saibaiman was going to kill him, Piccolo knocked out the attacker.  Krillin 
then fired a Kamehameha that split into 8 separate blast & killed all the 
Saibaimen & with the 8th blast attacked Vegeta & Nappa. The blast didnt seem 
to have effect on the Saiyan duo.  Since the Z Fighters sensed the enormous 
energy coming from the Saiyans, Tien & Yamcha used the Fusion Dance 
& became Tiencha, who effortlessly beat Nappa.  Tiencha started to attack 
Vegeta with all his strength, but go beat up badly.  Tiencha decide to use 
his ultimate attack, the Tri-Bomb, which is powered up like Tien's Tri-Beam & 
has the same amount of power as the Tri-Beam + looks like Yamcha's Energy 
Bomb & can be controlled like it too.  After its fired, the attack blows off 
all of Vegeta's armor, but knocks Tiencha out.  Fearful for Tien, Chiaotzu 
use his Self-Destruct on Vegeta & it does minor damage.  Vegeta finds that 
Tiencha is gone, who was taken out of the way by Piccolo. Krillin gives him a 
Senzu Bean & Krillin, Piccolo, & Tiencha use Multi-Form & the 9 fighters go 
attack Vegeta. The 3 Piccolo use Special Beam Cannon, the 3 Krillin use the 
Kamehameha, the 3 Tiencha use the Tri-Beam, & create a very large blast that 
Vegeta dodges with ease.  Vegeta then sees Gohan, who's still scared to 
fight, & fires a energy blast at him, which makes Gohan freeze in fright.   
Just then Goku use the Instant Transmission to teleport from King Kai's 
planet to Gohan & deflects the blast just in time.Now there is a change, 
Goku's basic power level should be greater than Vegeta's after the training 
for the Instant Transmission.  Vegeta's scouter senses this after it explodes 
for going over 25,000, which Goku's power is 40,000 .  Vegeta tries to attack 
Goku, but Goku uses a Kaio-Ken x1 & Vegeta gets smashed around & Vegeta says 
he's going to uses his Galic Gun to destroy Earth. Goku powers up a 
Kamehameha to stop the Galic Gun, which it does with ease.  Vegeta the 
creates the artificial moon light thing & transforms into Oozaru Vegeta, 
starts to gain the upper hand but Goku uses a Kaio-Ken x6, which he can now 
withstand because of his I.T. training & brings his power up to 240,000 & 
over powers Oozaru Vegeta.  Goku cuts off Vegeta's tail & Vegeta goes back to 
normal.  With Goku maxed out & brused, the others attack Vegeta, but with no 
avail.  Gohan was the only one able to fight. With his father's advice, Gohan 
starts to attack Vegeta & does very well, but then Gohan's tail reappears . 
Gohan the looks at the artifical moon light thing, goes into his Oozaru stage 
& is uncontrollable & almost wipes out the Z Fighters before Goku gets him 
under controll.  Oozaru Gohan statrs to attack Vegeta with some mouth blasts 
& dramaticlly brings down Vegeta's power level.  Vegeta creates an energy 
disc & cuts off Gohan's tail,but is traped under Gohan giant body & falls to 
the ground.  Being beaten, Vegeta activates his space pod & leves the Earth 
to heal.   Master Roshi, Yajirobe, Bluma, & Chi-Chi in a Capsule Crop. ship & 
picks up all the Z Fighters. In the ship, they're all given Senzu Beans to 
recover & go to a hospital to get their injuries fixed up, except for 
Piccolo, who goes back to his metitation training alone.  A couple months 
pass & the Z Fighters' power levels are: <BR><BR>
Goku-66,000 <BR>
Gohan-5,000 <BR>
(their power levels went up like this because they're Saiyans) <BR>
Piccolo4,500 <BR>
Tien-4,500 <BR>
Krillin-4,000 <BR>
Yamcha-3,500 <BR>
Chiaotzu-3,300 <BR>
(he was wished back after the fight with the Saiyans) <BR>
<BR><BR>
Then they see that Vegeta has returned & has gotten stronger, around what he 
beat Zarbon, 33,000 since he was last on Earth, but is still beaten by Goku.   
Vegeta then tells them about Namek, the Dragonballs on Namek, & Frieza. They 
all decide to go to Namek on the spaceship made by Bulma's dad, Dr. Briefs.   
All of them train using the gravity generator on the ship, except for Vegeta, 
who went on to Namek in his space pod.  The Z Fighters get passed to 
Invisible Spaceship & Fake Namek because of the better navigational system & 
get to Namek in 6 days.  That's the end of the Saiyan Saga & a little intro 
to the Freiza Saga. <br><br>

<b>What if Cell had first absrobed Andriod 18  instead of 17?
By:<a href="mailto:lord_grendel_harliquin@yahoo.com">Lord Grendel and Harliquin   
</a></b>
<br>
In the aftermath of the battle between Cell and 
Android 16, Cell emerges from a crater and sucks up 
Android 18 as the others look in horror. After the 
magnificent transformation Cell comes out looking very 
different, because of 18's influence. He retains his 
thin, insect-like form, but now he possesses the white 
face and voice of perfect cell. Tien does his Tri-Beam 
technique, blasting Near-Perfect Cell into the ground, 
while 17 and 16 escape. Tien eventfully tires. Krillan 
returns with the deactivator, and finding his love, 
18, absorbed and gone has no reason not to push the 
button, which he does. 17 and 16 fall lifeless. Now, 
Cell can't absorb them. Cell in a rage, crushes the 
life out of Krillen and Tien. Goku and Gohan can take 
no more. Risking everything, they attack, teleporting 
to the battlefield(by this time, Piccolo has died of 
his injures). After a lengthy battle, Gohan and Goku 
are easily killed along with the others. Cell yells 
out his rage to the world at the injustice fate has 
handed him. To satisfy his depression he goes back to 
absorbing whole cites and perhaps looking for Trunk's 
time machine. Meanwhile, Trunks and Vegeta emerge from 
the Room of Sprit and Time. They track down Cell(by 
this time, his powerlevel has grown so much it is 
impossible to hide) and proceed to beat the crap of 
him. Vegeta is just mad because Cell killed Goku 
before he could and Trunks just hates android. 
Eventfully Cell decides he can't win and he ends it 
all with a self-destruct, destroying the Earth and 
ending the series.

<b>What if Vegeta returned to Earth instead of going on to Nemek
By:<a href="mailto: lord_grendel_harliquin@yahoo.com">Lord Grendel and Harliquin 
</a></b>
<br>
If he was told about Freeza going to Nemek, but 
didn't care, he would go back to Earth and with his 
increased power level would cause a lot of damage. 
Gohan, Bulma, and Krillan would have already left for 
Namek. Goku, healed by the Senzu Beans, would do 
battle with him again. At this point Vegeta has a 
power level of 24,000, while Goku's is around 15,000. 
Vegeta would obviously be more powerful, but Goku can 
increase his power using the Kaioken, so they would be 
about equal. They would fight for while and cause a 
lot of property damage. Vegeta would sometime try to 
blow up the planet and Goku would stop him again. 
Eventfully,after hours of fighting, both would be worn 
down and Goku would take a Sensu Bean to recover. 
Vegeta,realizing that he would lose eventfully, would 
call a truce, playing on Goku's respect for him and 
reminding him that he is a Sayian too. Vegeta would 
then tell Goku about the evil Freeza,who is even more 
evil than he is and Freeza is also the one who killed 
both their fathers and destroyed their home planet. 
After this Goku would want to fight him. Vegeta would 
tell him that accepting him as an ally to defeat 
Freeza is a good idea since he is also a Sayian. 
Together they would enter the Capsule Corp Spaceship 
and head to Namek. On the way there, the two would 
train together in 100 times Earth's gravity. The 
gravity controls would be cranked to the maximum 
setting because of Vegeta's pride and any complaints 
from Goku would be seen as weakness in Vegeta's eyes. 
This would lead to Vegeta suggesting they can become 
stronger if they spar against each other. Both would 
become more powerful,much more earlier than they would 
be normally in the regular time-line. 

Meanwhile on Namek, without the interference of 
Vegeta, Freeza would collect all but the Guru Dragon 
Ball. Things would occur normally except for Kuwi 
showing up and Vegeta slaughtering Dodroia and Zarbon. 
Dende, Gohan and Krillan would probably be able to 
escape with a combination of hiding their power levels 
and the villans' seeing them as unimportant. They 
would reach Guru's place,talk with him, meet Nails and 
go through with Guru awaking their hidden powers. 
Confident in their increased power and due to Guru's 
weakened state, they make a stand at Guru's place. 
Freeza, Zarbon, Dodoria and their minions would arrive 
at Guru's place and lay waste to it. Nails , Gohan and 
Krillan would be no match for them and be defeated, 
but they take a lot of minions out before they go 
down. Gohan would go full bore and destroy Dodoria. 
Zarbon would transform and defeat Gohan. While they 
are laying unconscious Freeza would just take the 
dragon ball from Guru and prepare to kill him. Guru 
would warn Freeza that the dragon balls would 
disappear if he does so. Freeza wouldn't risk it and 
take them all captive. Freeza , using his telekinetic 
power on them, would transport them back to the 
spaceship and put them in the rejuvenation tanks to 
prevent them from dying. Freeza would attempt to make 
his wish. Nothing happens of course. He demands an 
answer from Guru, who tells him it requires a password 
and Guru refuses to tell him it. Freeza puts Guru in 
dire straits by threatening to torture him and the 
others until the password is revealed. He laughs and 
imprisons them in the bowels of the ship. Freeza, 
finds out that Gohan is a Sayian and maybe even the 
last one, since there had been no news of Vegeta, he 
would assume he was killed on Earth. Freeza would 
offer him a position in his empire. Gohan would 
refuse. Freeza would laugh and tell him he will be 
tortured when they get back to Freeza'a home planet. 
Preparations are made to take off. But then the 
Capsule Spaceship crashes literally through the roof. 
Vegeta and Goku emerge both glowing with power. At 
this point Goku's power would be about equal to him 
after being healed from his fight with Captain Ginyu 
and Vegeta's would be about equal to when he was 
healed after Krillan's blast in the "real world". 
Zarbon challenges them, thinking them weak because 
their power levels are kept down(Note:Their more 
powerful because they were training at 100 G's from 
the very beginning and they had a partner to spar 
with). Unveiling their new power, Zarbon would be 
killed almost instantly. Freeza would take on both of 
them, transforming when he needed to.(Note:In this 
possibility, Freeza would have either no reason or no 
time to call the Ginyu for help, so they would not be 
used in this story, they still could be reserved as 
villains in future episodes) Meanwhile Dende, Gohan 
and Krillan would grab the dragon balls and wish 
Piccolo back to life. Boom, the dragon balls are 
restored back on Earth. Goku, while fighting Freeza, 
would telepathically refuse to allow Piccolo to come 
to Namek, thinking that he would only get in the way. 
So the next 
two wishes would be to restore the everyone slain by 
Freeza and his minions to life and take everyone on 
Namek except for Vegeta, Freeza and Goku, to someplace 
safer like Earth.(Note:Guru is kept in a rejuvenation 
tank, so he is prevented from dying) That done with, 
Freeza assumes final transformation and begins to play 
with both Vegeta and Goku. Goku and Vegeta both take 
the Senzu Beans they took along with them to keep up 
with Freeza, their power levels gradually increasing. 
Finally Vegeta and Freeza realize that everyone is 
gone and so are the dragon balls, depriving both 
villains of immortality. This drives Vegeta into a 
rage and he goes Super-Sayian much more earlier than 
in the series. He would than begin to kick the crap 
out of Freeza, and swears that Goku will be next. 
Freeza would then destroy Namek to win the fight. This 
would enrage Goku enough to go Super-Sayian as well. 
Vegeta, while very powerful would be worn down. Goku 
takes over while Vegeta searches for a means of 
getting off the planet. Freeza, beaten and bloody and 
driven insane by being beaten by two "stupid monkeys" 
would create two energy disks like in the original 
series. They would chase Goku around and would cut 
Freeza in half. Goku would give him a little power to 
make them able to escape. Meanwhile Vegeta would find 
the ship and with his training would be able to fly 
it. Right when Freeza is about to betray Goku by 
blasting him in the back, Vegeta swoons in and blasts 
Freeza into oblivion and finally has his revenge. He 
doesn't try to kill Goku because he wants a straight 
fight and they have to get away before the planet 
explodes. Goku gets on board and chastises Vegeta for 
doing that, like when Vegeta killed the fallen Ginyu 
Force in the series. They take off and end up on the 
alien world where they both learn the alien technique 
of "Instant Transmission". 

From then on things back on Earth occur normally. King 
Cold arrives on Earth to get revenge for the death of 
his son(who is dead). He may even bring along the 
Ginyu 
Force. Nails would join the Z fighters. Trunks would 
still arrive and defeat them. Goku and Vegeta would 
return after the fight and be told about the andriods 
and so forth. 

(Note: The only problem with this possibility would be 
focusing too much on Vegeta.)

<b>What If Goku had been on earth during the Garlic Jr.Saga? By:<a href="mailto:Lugiarules@aol.com">LugiaRules</a>

<br>
At the beginning of the saga, goku and gohan would try to get chichi to let 
them go to master roshi's party, she would say no, and thay would sneak out 
anyway. When garlic jr and the spice boys arrived at Kami's Lookout, goku 
would most likely sense them, and use the instantaneous movement to take him 
and the z fighters to kami's lookout. garlic jr would order the spice boys to 
attack goku, who would go super saiyan and kill them all easily. Garlic Jr 
would see how powerful Goku was and sneak off to get the black water mist 
while goku was distracted with the spice boys. The mist would be released, 
and everyone would become evil, except piccolo, who is immune, and goku, who, 
due to his purity, would probably not be affected by the mist either or just 
avoid it. The infected Z fighters would begin attacking Goku and Piccolo, who 
would fight them off with ease. Goku would easily get Kami and Mr. Popo away 
from Garlic Jr. Kami and popo would go to the seven air currents as normal, 
while piccolo fought the infected z warriors and goku beat Garlic jr's @$$. 
Garlic Jr would transform and still get beaten bad by goku. Kami and popo 
would release the holy water, garlic jr would get pissed and open the dead 
zone, and goku would either knock garlic jr into the dead zone or just blow 
up the makyo star, as he could do either one quite easily. The rest of the 
dbz would go as normal. Many other things are possible, but this is just my 
opinion.
