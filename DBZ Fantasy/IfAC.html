 What if Future Gohan had survived the fight with the androids?
By:<a href="mailto:Barfster001@aol.com ">Barfster001</a></b>
<br>
<br>

Sorry Stwar, but I also had these ideas too, so don't think I'm plagiarizing 
you. 
      Trunks would wake up and go to the city and see Gohan nearly dead, but 
Trunks who was surrounded by rage would think he was dead and go SS. But then 
he would see his master was alive and he would take him to Bulmas to get 
healed, because Korin was killed by the androids. Then they would train for a 
few more months and then fight the androids again. This would be in another 
city and the androids would be surprised that Trunks was a SS, and Gohan was 
alive. So Gohan would fight 17 and Trunks would fight 18. Trunks would be at 
Vegetas strength in the series, and since the androids are alot weaker in 
this time period Trunks would be nearly as strong as 18, so he would get in 
alot of good punches and kicks, and then fire a gigantic burning attack that 
would also hit 17 and distract him so Gohan could finish him off. Then they 
would team up and fight 18, who would take out Trunks, but be killed by 
Gohan. So later both would go in the time machine to save the future. When 
they arrive Gohan would kill King Kold, and Trunks would kill Freeza. Then 
when Goku comes he would take on both of them and lose, but still be OK with 
that. Then they would tell him about the future and Goku would realize Future 
Gohan was his son, and so would present Gohan, Piccolo, and Kururin. So Goku 
would ask Gohan to stay with them, and since the Future was safe he would say 
OK, and tell Trunks to come back in 3 years. So when the training starts both 
Gohans learn Gokus techniques and get very strong. Piccolo and Vegeta would 
train with them and also teach Gohan their abilities. When sparring starts 
Future Gohan is the leader until Present Gohan starts to grab hold of his 
hidden power, and turns SS. So he gets alot stronger from that and starts to 
catch up to Goku's power. When the 3 years are over the Gohans are the 
strongest except for Goku who's strength doubled after he was healed by the 
heart medicine when he was nearly killed. So when 19 and 20 show up Gohan 
wonders if these are the androids because of their appearance, but 20 states 
he and 19 are androids made by Dr. Gero. So then Trunks shows up and sees the 
androids and also wonders if they are the androids, but 20 starts to absorb 
people, and 19 fights Present(P) Gohan and Piccolo. 20's power is now growing 
abnormally large, so he gets overconfident and starts to fight Vegeta who is 
a SS and much stronger than in the series, and stronger than 20. So he kills 
20 and then moves on to 19 who has absorbed Piccolos energy and F Gohan and P 
Gohan are fighting him. Vegeta not knowing about 19 absorbing attacks fires a 
big band at 19, but it is absorbed, and 19 then absorbs both Gohans and 
Vegetas, then says he will awaken 16, 17 and 18 so Trunks knows about 17 and 
18 and runs off to stop 19. Meanwhile Goku is healing everyone. F Gohan then 
traces Trunks's energy to the lab where Trunks is being beaken by 17, 18, and 
19. He steps in and tries to kill 17, but notices he's much stronger. Then 18 
fires a hells blast at Gohan knocking him out. Then P Gohan shows up and 
fights 17 and starts gaining the upper hand, then Piccolo and Tein show up 
and fight 18, and also start winning the battle. When Goku shows up he uses a 
Kao-ken 80x which he learned during the 3 years of training and kills 19. F 
Gohan then wakes up and attacks 18 at full force and fires a masenko that 
destroys he cloths, but she is barley hurt. P Gohan is running out of energy, 
so Vegeta shows up and fights 17, but loses very quickly, so evryone floes 
off worried about the androids power. So a day after that they fight the 
androids again, and Goku uses a kao-ken 50x and causes significant damage to 
them, but is worn out by all energy he used to do that. Then Piccolo fights 
17 and uses his special beam cannon to hurt 17 but not very much, stunned by 
the androids power Trunks goes SS and fires another gigantic burning attack 
but 17 holds it for a second and tosses it at Yamcha who is then rushed to 
the hospital by Tein. Kururin uses a distructo disk on 18, but she spins it 
like pizza dough and cuts off Piccolos arm, which is regenerated. Once again 
the Z team retreats, and Piccolo goes to fuse with Kami. Kami exepts because 
the androids are becoming such a large threat. The new Piccolo then tracks 
down the androids and fights 17 and gains the upper hand for a long time, but 
when it looks like Piccolo has won 18 jumps in and they double team Piccolo. 
Then F Gohan shows up and fights 18 and uses a kao-ken 10x and holds his own 
for awhile. P Gohan also arrives and together P and F Gohan kill 18. but 17 
escapes and later that day Cell arrives and absorbs large amouts of cities 
and 17. So Piccolo again tries to fights an android, but Cells powers are 
much lager and he absobs Piccolo becoming even stronger. Tein, Yamcha, 
Kururin, and Vegeta show up and the humans are absobed so Vegeta barely 
escapes. Cell continues his absorbing spree while the two Gohan train the 
room of time and spirit. When the come out they try to kill Cell with a 
double kamehameha, but he regenerates from one brain cell left, and now he's 
reached his final form. Then he would fire a Gammit Gun and wipe out both 
Gohans. Then Vegeta and Goku would exit the room of spirit and time while 
Piccolo and Trunks enter. Vegeta being full of himself would try and take on 
Cell, he actually would hold his own because he got much stronger than in the 
series while training with Goku. Then Vegeta would go USS and start to lose 
because of the decreased speed. Cell would elbow Vegeta in the ribs, chop him 
is the neck disabeling him, then fireing  a Freeza Beam. The concentrated 
amout of energy would slice through Vegetas stomach and then he would power 
up a spirit bomb, but Goku would come in and give Vegeta a senzu and throw 
off Cells concentration and the spirit bomb would fall on Cell and the blue 
radiating heat would send shockwaves destorying mounians and wiping out many 
forests. Then Cell would talk about the Cell games, and Calling anybody to 
take him on. So both Gohans, Trunks, Vegeta, Piccolo, Tien, Yamcha, and 
Kururin would train in the room of spirit and time. Goku would take his time 
relaxing and training Chibi Trunks, and Goten, both were born earlier than in 
the series, they are both 3. Goten and Trunks would convince Goku to let them 
train for 2 days so Goku wouldn't mind. When everyone leaves on the 5th day 
everyone would be done training in the room of spirit and time so Goten and 
Chibi Trunks would enter and train so they get to the level of 2,000,000 when 
they are 5, When Chi Chi and Bulma find out what happened they go insane and   
want their babies back, but Goten and Trunks fly off to Dr. Geros Lab and 
explore and find Cell and 16. They destroy Cells lab while playing "blow up 
the really cool and expensive looking machines while trying to destroy the 
evil Cell and save the world and then get a buch of new toys and candy and 
more toys." Man those kids think up cool names. Anyway they then find 16 and 
release him. He sees Goten and thinks he's Goku and begins to attack, so they 
start to fight him, but he overpowers them so they run away to their mommys. 
So when Goku finds them because the suposidly ran away he fights 16 and 
destroys him. Goten wants Goku to train him with that cool power up 
technique-the kao-ken so Goten learns it, but Trunks wants his dad to teach 
him the loud noise attack-the big bang. After the intense training to learn 
the attacks they are at 2,500,000. Then when the Cell games start Goten and 
Trunks want to enter, so Goku and Vegeta say it's OK. When Hercule and his 
krones step up they are easily beaten. Then Cell says that he is so powerful 
that his offspring could beat the Z team. So as you could guess he made Cell 
jr.s for everybody. Goten and Trunks have a hard time fighting even one of 
them, but Goten used his best attack the kao-ken 5x and that brought him up 
to 12,500,000 and he starts to hit one of the Cell jrs. Kururin is dodging 
like mad, Yamcha is trying to hit his even one with a wolf-fang-fist, Tein is 
going all out like with 1st form Cell in the series fireing Tri-beams like 
wild, Both Gohans are doing fine, and F Gohan is taking on 2 at once, Trunks 
is also doing fine and occasionaly having enough time to fire a Burning 
attack, Vegeta is also going all out with fatal enegy blasts scaring his Cell 
jr., Goku and Piccolo are fighting together taking on theirs and Hercules and 
his crones Cell jrs. Then Cell fires a tri-beam at Goten and Trunks, which 
nearly kills them. This causes Goku, both Gohans, Trunks and Vegeta to go 
SS2. But Piccolo senses their energy and gives them senzus and when they are 
healed they are strong enough to go SS. Because Cell absorbed more people and 
the androids were stronger Cell is only a tadd bit weaker than the sayins who 
acquiered SS2. But when he is nearly beaten he steals Kururins senzus and 
heals himself getting stronger and stroner until they he is out. Then he 
orders his Cell jrs. to attack again, but F Gohan now the strongest warrior 
destroys all of them and then destroys Cell for real. So thats about all that 
happened because Babidi was to afraid to steal energy to release Buu. No 
plans were made to finish Bebi so Super 17 dosn't happen because Dr. Myuu had 
to help build him, and the Shenlong saga also dosen't happen.

<b>-NEW- What if Goku never had the heart virus in Trunks Time? 
By:<a href="mailto:Barfster001@aol.com ">Barfster001</a></b>
<br>
<br>

 Goku and the world would live in peace for a few months, and then the 
androids would strike. Goku would be the first to try, he would start off 
with a kao-ken 10x, and beat on android 18, while Piccolo, Vegeta, and Tein 
would fight 17. Goku would then start to wear down and 18 would nearly kill 
Goku, but Gohan, Yamcha, and Kururin would fire dozens of kamehamehas at the 
android, and 18 would show a small amount of pain. Piccolo and Vegeta would 
power up their strongest attacks while Tein would take a large beating from 
17, and they would unleash their attacks that would throw 17 into a few 
buildings roughing him up. So Gohan would try and fight 18 but easily be 
beaten, and make her think he was dead. So Goku would use a kao-ken 20x and 
kick android 18 in the head, then knee her in the gut, speed around her in a 
circle while firing a massive amount of energy at 18, and she would fall to 
her knees, so Goku would power up a large red beam that would shoot at her, 
and she would fake the crew into thinking she was dead. So Vegeta would be in 
a bloody heap, Piccolo and Tein would have many limbs lost. Yamcha and 
Kururin would use some weak attacks to make small cuts in 17, so 17 would 
power up a hells flash and fire it at Yamcha and Kururin, most of their bones 
would be shattered, so Tein would rush them to a hospital. Gohan would then 
get up and start firing masenkos wildly missing and destroying what was left 
of the cities populace. 17 would then fight Piccolo who was missing half his 
chest and one arm. So when he was going to deliver the final blow he would 
regenerate and punch 17 in the stomach, but 17 would kick his neck and 
suffocate him, but Gohan would go SS and ram into 17's ribs with his head, so 
Piccolo and Gohan would fire double energy blasts forcing 17 to leave with 
18s broken body. 
      13 years  would pass and the Z crew and androids would always battle 
to a stale mate. Trunks and Goten would be 14 and 13 both able to go SS, 
while the Z crew is slowly getting stronger. Goku has learned the kao-ken 
50x, Vegeta would just be fed up with destroying the androids, while Piccolo 
and the humans were starting to fall behind, because they were training the 
kids. Gohan would look like he did in the movie/special, having a vast 
knowledge of everyone's training methods, and attacks, Gohan could single 
handily defeat the androids if he was given time to train, but he would only 
be and equal to the demonic androids. 
      So one day the androids would strike and the Z crew would go to fight 
the androids minus Goten and Trunks who are way behind everyone's powers, but 
they would sneak away and watch the team fight the androids. Gohan and 17 
would duel for a while, then Gohan would use a kao-ken 5x to elbow 17's head, 
then knee it and shoot his foot straight into 17's lung. Piccolo would then 
jump in and fire a special beam cannon at 17 creating a large pot hole and a 
very P. Oed 17, so he would fly into Piccolos head, and then fire a hells 
flash in his leg destroying it, then Tein would fire dozens of tri-beams, 
hurting Piccolo and 17 at the same time. Piccolo would fall down and collapse 
because of all the damage he took in. 17 would then keep teleporting around 
Tein until he would slam his whole body into Teins back, paralyzing him. 
Gohan would again show up and fire a Gammit Gun, but 18 would fly up at the 
last second and eye beam he in the arm, and he would fire it in the direction 
of Goten and Trunks, so they would fly away nearly being blown up. 
      18 would see this and go over to them and start fighting. Trunks and 
Goten SS would barley be able to keep up, and like in the movie she would toy 
with Trunks, but Goten would fire a gigantic kamehameha at 18, so Trunks 
would fly up in the air to escape, and 18 would crash into the ground with 
some damage. Goku and Vegeta would then come and fire a big bang and dragon 
blast which is like the dragon fist, but is shot from the hand, and isn't a 
physical blow, so 18 would hit Yamcha and Kururin who were trying a sneak 
attack. Trunks and Goten would fire millions of energy blasts to make their 
escape, while Gohan and 17 were hit by this barrage, and the others flew 
away. So when Gohan would get up he would see 17 and 18 ready to kill him, 
but he would use a solar flare to get away. 
      Goku would be sick of the androids, and would finally tell everyone 
about the room of spirit and time, and he didn't tell them because he thought 
the androids would destroy the world if they left for a day. Trunks and Goten 
would go in first and come out as USS. So they would leave to find the 
androids. They would find them destroying the theme park like in the movie, 
and they would start to fight. Trunks would use his Finish Buster to send the 
androids into different parts of the park, Goten would find 17 in a fun house 
and the two would duke it out in the mirror room, and he would use his 
Fireball to destroy all of the mirrors and he would chop 17 in the neck, kick 
him in the gut, fire and eye beam at his head, and then use and ultimate 
attack to take 17 by surprise and nearly blow his head off, then he would 
fire a volley of punches at him, 17 would then fly away and Goten would chase 
him down the halls, until they moved into the haunted house, where 17 would 
keep hiding and then power up energy attacks, but not fire them, so the 
blasts were in his hand, and he would punch Goten burning holes in his chest. 
Goten would then blast the whole place away, and he and 17 would start a fist 
fight, Goten with a massive amount of muscle on him, would easily take the 
advantage, but he would start to slow down and 17 would begin to get the 
upper hand, but Trunks would show up and trip 17 and knee him in the gut and 
the two would fly away. 
      But before he showed up he and 18 had started to fight on a bunch of 
roller coasters. He would knock her into one of the carts and then blow it 
up, and she would crash and wreck the ride. Their battle would get to the 
Ferris wheel, and Trunks would knock 18 into the wheel and she would fly out 
and kick him in the kidney, so he would rip off the wheel and slam it into he 
crushing her body, but she would show little hurt, and destroy a few rides, 
Trunks would then get 18 in a bear hug and surround himself with energy, 
which would shock her, causing both a large amount of pain. She would then 
fly backwards, and slam him into hundreds of buildings. So he would spin in a 
circle at a very fast speed, and she would fall down to the ground, and he 
would leave her and 17 and he would go get Goten and leave. 
      The next day Gohan and Piccolo would leave, Gohan would learn USS, and 
piccolo would be double his average power. Gohan would take on 17 who was 
weakened by his fight, and Piccolo would fight 18 who was also tired out from 
the battle. Gohan and Piccolo would dominate for 2 or 3 hours, but then they 
would start to show fatigue, and the androids would beat the $hit out of 
them, and then they would run away. 
      Vegeta and Goku would then leave, followed by Tein and Yamcha and then 
Kururin and Chautzu, and they would go on a search for the androids. But they 
would be at the base of Kami's lookout, and when the Z theam left they would 
fly up and see the room of spirit of time and train in it for 2 days, and 
when they left both would be much stronger than anybody on the Z team because 
they never tired out and continuasly trained for two years. So when they all 
returned, they would be beaten to near death, and then they would go on a 
rampage. so the Z team would train for another day in the room of spirit and 
time. Gohan and Goku would find the androids, and both would go USS and 
attack at full force, and then the Z team would show up, and they would kill 
the androids. Then a few years later Cell would show up, and the whole world 
would have lived in peace leaving all Z fighters weak, with the exception of 
Goten and Trunks. 
      Cell would go about absorbing citys and later his power would be 
greater than most Z fighters, but then the two kids who are now both 18 
(because Goten spent one year in the r.o.s.a.t, and became as old as Trunks), 
and then they would attack him with a fire/thunderball, which they both made, 
and that would destroy Cells head, and since he couldn't regenerate he would 
die, and the world would then live in peace forever.

 What if Bulma never made a time machine? 
By:<a href="mailto:Barfster001@aol.com ">Barfster001</a></b>
<br>

This starts in Trunk's universe, after he was beaten by the androids he would 
heal and continue to train. Then after several more beatings he would be 
passed Future Gohans strength which was stronger than the androids. He would 
once again go off to fight the androids and end up killing 18 and run away. 
This would happen 1 year before Cell arrives. Then he would continue to fight 
17 and always be close to killing him. So 17 would run away to Dr. Geros lab 
and awaken 16. 16 would be at the same strength as in regual DBZ and would be 
slighty stronger than Trunks and wouldn't be as peaceful as he was. Then Cell 
would arrive to find Trunks duking it out with 17 and 16. 16 would see Cell 
and start to fight him, easily winning beacuse Cell couldn't absorb anybody. 
But Cell would use his solar flare to sneak passed 16 and absorb 17. Then at 
his new power he would ask where 18 was and Trunks would say he killed her. 
This would enrage Cell and he would crush Trunks. By now 16 would get his 
sight back and join in the fray only to have half his head destroyed like in 
the sereis. So they would run off to get healed and 16 would use his 
information about Goku to remember the room of spirit and time. so they would 
go off to train for a day and both would come out with a power around Vegetas 
after he leaves the room of spirit and time. Days later they would find Cell 
having absorbed hundreds of towns so his power would be much larger than both 
of theirs but they would still fight and lose badly. They would then once 
again go off to train for a year in a day. Now when they come out  their 
power would be around Gokus after leaving the room of spirit and time. Two 
days later they find Cell with a power only a bit larger than theirs so 16 
and Trunks would attack. Trunks would use a Burning attack to weaken Cell a 
great deal and then 16 would use his arms to attack from a distance while 
Trunks distracks him. Cell would then fake death and 16 and Trunks wouldn't 
notice his power. So he would spend his next days searching for other strong 
but weaker opponents to absorb. He would find the bodies of the Z warriors 
still in the city 9 miles south west of south city. He would absorb them and 
their powers somehow. Cell being over confident would track down Trunks and 
16 training together. But on his way he would find the dead body of 18 and 
absorb it to become Perfect.Quickly tracking down Trunks and 16 he would 
surprise them and defeat them with little trouble. Cell would then fly off 
and make cell juniors to destroy the world. King Ki sick of watching earth 
suffer would go to Namek and get Dende to make new dragonballs and be the 
guardien of earth. He would then summon Trunks and 16 to get the dragonballs 
and wish everyone killed by the androids and Cell to come back. So the Z 
warriors would come back and go to find Dende. Trunks would explain the 
stroy, but 16 would see Goku and remember his mission to destroy him. He 
would attack full force, but Goku had trained for all those years and would 
easily keep him under control. The second wish would be to make 16 good 
forever and that would be the last wisha nd the balls would scatter. So for 
the next few weeks the Z warriors would train for 2 days each, and Piccolo 
and Kami would fuse. Cell would sense the high amount of energy and go to 
investergate. Cell would arrive but be in shock beacuse he though most of 
them were dead. He would then think up the Cell games thinking he was the 
strongest and be killed by a SS3 Goku. But Goku would want to warn another 
time about the androids and have Bulma make one anyway. So he would leave to 
our universe "yay" and  kill the androids single handedly. But wait Dr Gero 
likes to linger beacuse theirs a movie cross over! Androdis  13, 14, and 15, 
are made and are as strong as a SS 3 Goku. They come a year later and the 
androids would get the dragonballs back and wish for all the villians back. 
This revives androids 17, 18, 20, and 21 aka Cell Freeza, King Cold and 
evryone else. Since 20 is alive he awakens 19 and the world looks grim even 
the Red Ribbon armys back along with Piccolo Diamo, Nappa, Ginyu force, and 
Radditz . And after all that time the 2 sayins Radditz and Nappa can turn SS. 
But Goku steps up and kills the Ginyus, and RR with little trouble. Now 
Piccolo Diamo fuses with his son Piccolo to become one of the strongest 
warriors ever. But Goku our valient hero kills the new Piccolo Diamo but 
saves Piccolo and Kami. Meanwhile Freeza and his dad square off with Gohan 
even at SS he loses but discovers SS2 and kills them. Now radditz and Nappa 
are more of a match for Vegeta, but with the help of 16 he kills them. This 
once again leaves the androids the only enemys. 19, and 20 went on a 
absorbing spree and their powers are abve all human and namek powers, but 
once again 16 helps Piccolo and Tein defeta them. 17 and 18 and being beaten 
by Trunks whose fury has turned him SS 2. But Kururin finds the dragonballs 
and wishes to turn 18 human( 13, 14, and 15 only used one wish). 18 now turns 
good and turns on her brother to help Gohan kill 17. Now only 13, 14, 15 and 
Cell are left. Goku uses his spirit bomb to kill 14 and 15. 13 and Cell fuse, 
but at the last second Cell absorbes 13 and he is more than a match for a 
fused SS 3 Goku and SS 2 Vegeta. Then seeing their fathers being beaten 
Trunks and Gohan fuse both at SS 2. Both of the fusions use their major 
attacks to only tick off Cell. So at the last minute they fuse to make a SS 4 
fusion that is barley above cells power. 10 minutes later the fusion lets 
call it Trunku gets severly weaker because Gogetas fusion wore off, then in 
another 5 minuets he is reduced down to only a SS beacuse Gohan+Trunks lets 
call Trunhan wore off, but all 4 are fused together. 15 min after that the 
fusion is compeletly off and each of the sayins can't go SS. So Tein and 
Yamcha fuse  to make  Yamien and they are just beaten by Cell So everyone 
runs away for a year to train for 2 years in 2 days. Once again everyon fuses 
in fours except Piccolo who fuses with Dende to make Dendiccolo, then there's 
Kururcha, and Trunku. ALso during the year of training the Z warriors made a 
wish to have any race fuse for any amount of time. so all fusions fuse to 
make Vegchauende. He looks like a cross between Gogeta and piccolo with Teins 
third eye. They combined use their various techniques to overpower cell and 
as an hour passes things look bleak for cell the fusion wears out because of 
the vast amount of energy and cell kills everyone except Trunks and Gohan(wow 
talk about Deja Vu). Now Trunks cuts off Cells head and Gohan uses a choun 
Kamehameha to kill him once and for all. Man all this because of one stupid 
invention, Bulma don't quit your day job.

<b>What if Bardocks team had waited for him to heal? 

By:<a href="mailto:Barfster001@aol.com ">Barfster001</a></b>
<br>

      When Bardock would have woken up they would be a bit worried about 
him, but tell him about the mission to meat, so he would get ready to go, and 
then leave. When they would arrive on meat Bardock and Toma would detect some 
high powers and everyone would go to investigate them, only to discover 
Didoria and his team waiting for them, so they would get ready to fight.<BR><BR> 
      Bardock would be the first to step up and start to fight Didorias 4 
men. He would fire hundreds of ki blasts and destroy two of the men, but then 
he would get visions of the future and start to get beaten up, but Toma would 
jump in and destroy one of the men and Totepo would kill another. With 
Didoria left Serpia, Toma, Totepo, and Panbunkin would attack him with energy 
blasts that would destroy one of his arms, and then he would use the ultimate 
skill attack, or the energy blast from the mouth, this would deeply injure 
everyone except Bardock. He would jump in and kill Didoria. <BR><BR>
      When returning from meat everyone would be healed and then Bardock 
would know about Freeza destroying Vegeta. So he would gather up his crew and 
the rest of Vegeta to turn against Freeza, King Vegeta would hear about this 
and tell the planet about his plan to kill Freeza. So when Freeza's ship 
would arrive it would be destroyed by millions of energy blasts, leaving 
Zarbon and Freeza who were strong enough to protect themselves. <BR><BR>
      So then hundreds of fake moons would be made and all of Vegetas 
populace would be giant apes. They would all attack Freeza and Zarbon and 
kill both of them with their overwhelming power. When King Kold would receive 
the news he would go to Vegeta and try to destroy it, but Bardock would have 
thought of this happening so the planet had spent a year training tell Kold 
would arrive. When they would transform their powers would be in the 
millions. So Bardock would go on the rampage causeing surges of raw power to 
destroy the Ginyus and all of Kolds men, and even start to damage Kold 
himself. Finaly King Kold would be destroyed and the Sayins would realize 
their evil ways. But it dosn't stop there. <BR><BR>
      Early in the Dragonball saga Bardock come to earth remebering his son 
and would stay with Goku , and defeat the Red Ribbon, and Piccolo because he 
came in just after the 21st Tenchanichi Bukodkai , so Goku would grow up to 
be a stronger figter and eveything would be the same, except for the Radditz, 
Vegeta, and Freeza  saga not happening, but Bardock would easily kill the 
androids,Babidi, and Super 17. <BR><BR>
      The Bebi saga wouldn't happen because a sayin would discover him and 
kill him, and the shenlong saga didn't happen because Piccolo couldn't make

<b>What if Goku hadn't fallen off snake way?  

By:<a href="mailto:Barfster001@aol.com ">Barfster001</a></b>
<br>

      Goku would have continued to run across snake way until he got to 
princess snakes house and got fully rested and fed, so when he escaped he 
would fly off and make it to king kais two months ahead of the series. Then 
he would train with king kai and learn the kao-ken 5x and be able to 
withstand a kao-ken 3x. (Goku in the series could use a kao-ken 4x, but could 
only withstand a kao-ken 2x.) And his power would be at 10,000. So later on 
he would be wished back one day before the sayins arrive and would use a 
kao-ken 3x so he would cross snake way a great deal faster and arrive on 
earth 12 hours before the series. <BR><BR>
      So he would come in right before Tein would use his mega blast. So 
Tein would use it on Nappa, but Goku would give him a senzu and he would stay 
alive. Then he would kill Nappa with a kao-ken, then he would tell everyone 
to leave so he could fight Vegeta. Goku would start off with a kao-ken 2x and 
easily start to beat Vegeta, then he would use a kao-ken 3x and fire a giant 
Kamehameha that would destroy all of Vegetas armor, so he would power up a 
Gammit Gun. Goku would fire another Kamehameha and it would be equal to 
Vegetas Gammit Gun until he used a kao-ken 3x and nearly killed Vegeta, so 
Vegeta would leave earth and warn Goku about Freeza and Namek. <BR><BR>
      So Goku, Tein, Piccolo, Gohan, and Kururin would immediately leave on 
Kamis space ship since nobody was injured, but Bulma would not go because 
Piccolo still knew Namekian and Bulma gave them some scouters she duplicated 
(It wasn't destroyed by Goku using a kao-ken). Then they would train for one 
month on the space ship and Goku would be at 40,000 at the end of the month, 
Tein would be at 22,000, Piccolo 28,000, Gohan 19,500, Kururin 15,000. So 
when they get to Namek everyone would go for a certain village and get five 
dragonballs and warn the Nameks about Freeza. <BR><BR>
      Then when Freeza and Vegeta arrive one week later they send out 12 men 
to investigate the high power levels, so Kui and 11 men would attack Gohan, 
Tein, and Kururin because Piccolo and Piccolo went off to get the 6th 
dragonball from Guru. Tein would use a Tri-beam to destroy 8 of the men, and 
Kururin would use a distructo disk to kill 3 others. Gohan would fight Kui 
and fire hundreds of Masenkos at him, which would obliterate him. Freeza 
would sense this on his scouter and send Didoria and 15 men with him. Didoria 
would show up and Tein and him would square off, while Gohan and Kururin 
would make quick work of his men and then help Tein who was losing his 
battle. Then Piccolo would show up and use a special beam cannon on Didoria 
blasting a hole through his heart, then Goku would come back and use a 
kao-ken 5x and kill Didoria. <BR><BR>
      Freeza again would see another power that was much stronger, over 
100,000 which was Goku and he would call the Ginyus. So Goku would tell Gohan 
and the rest of the team about Gurus power up. Goku would be at 250,000 with 
his power up and when Piccolo got his he would be at 200,000. So Vegeta would 
go to another village and get the last dragonball. So Vegeta would then find 
Gohan and Kururin all alone because Tein and Piccolo went with Goku to get 
power ups. Vegeta would be at 24,000 and Gohan would be at 20,000 and he 
would lose badly, and Kururin would come and help Gohan, but he would still 
lose badly. <BR><BR>
      When Vegeta would be about to give the finishing blow to the two of 
them Goku would show up and send Vegeta to Freezas ship so he could be healed 
(Vegeta is on Freezas side because Goku was much stronger.) So when the 
Ginyus come it's Tein at 190,000 and Piccolo at 215,000 fighting Recoome and 
Goldo. Goldo would be easily killed by their speed and Recoome would fire his 
eraser gun that would blow up one of Piccolos arms, but he would regenerate 
and then kill Recoome. Jeice and Burtur would use their combined attack that 
would miss them both, so they would kill both of them. Gohan and Kururin 
would then show up and be between 30,000 and 80,000. Ginyu would show up and 
steal Teins body, but Piccolo would beat him up and then trick him into going 
into his old body then kill him. Vegeta would be fighting Zarbon because he 
began to want to make his own wish. So he would heal him and then Vegeta 
would kill Zarbon once he was healed. <BR><BR>
      Freeza would come and hunt Vegeta down, but Nail would show up with 
Piccolo and they would fight Freeza and get beaten. Goku would come and use a 
kao-ken 10x and beat the $hit out of Freeza, but he would transform and 
nearly kill Goku and the rest of the team, then he would heal them so he 
could learn where the dragonballs were. <BR><BR>
      Then Vegeta would show up and be at 45,000 and think he could kill 
Freeza and he would also get beaten so he would also get healed. When they 
got out of rejuvenation Vegeta would go on a killing spree destroying all of 
Freezas men, so Freeza would request more men and then he would go to fight 
Vegeta. Goku would get out of the tank and would be at 500,000 and Piccolo 
and Nail would fuse, and since he wasn't nearly dead and they would be at 
1,150,000. Gohan would be at 160,000, Kururin would be at 42,000 and Tein 
would be at 300,000. They would then find Freeza and he would go to his 3rd 
form and Goku and him would be equal with the help of a 10x kao-ken. <BR><BR>
      Then he would go to his 4th form and start to when, and Goku would 
have to use a kao-ken 20x just to keep up, but then Kururin would use a 
distructo disk to cut off Freezas tail and then Freeza would kill him causing 
Goku to go SS and then he would tell Gohan to get the dragonballs and wish 
everyone to be sent to earth, and for Kururin and Yamcha to be wished back. 
So Gohan would obey and then the planet would be empty except for Goku and 
Freeza. Freeza afraid of being killed by a monkey would go to 100% power, but 
then get killed by a super kamehameha. <BR><BR>
      Then Goku would get to his ship and go to earth, but a meteor shower 
would hit his ship and he would land on Yardrat. So he would attempt to learn 
the Instant Transmission. On earth when Garlic Jr. comes Gohan, Tein, Vegeta, 
and Piccolo would kill him, and when King Kold lands to seek revenge for his 
dead son Piccolo face him, but would lose after a while, but Trunks would 
come and kill him and then Goku would show up and you know what happens, then 
3 years later Goku comes down with the heart disease and Gohan and Piccolo 
team up to fight androids 19 and 20. Piccolo would kill 19, and Gohan would 
have a problem with 20 because he kept absorbing Gohans energy, so Vegeta 
would come in and try to kill him with a big bang, but since he wasn't as 
strong as in the series he only caused a small amount of damage, and then he 
would turn SS and be only a margin ahead of 20 and then Yamcha and Tein would 
attack with a tri-beam and kamehameha, but 20 would absorb the attacks and 
become stronger than any of them, and then Vegeta would still want to kill 20 
and start a fist fight, but every time a punch was caught Vegeta had a small 
bit of power absorbed, until he loses SS. <BR><BR>
      Then Piccolo would come in and use his mystic attack to rip off one of 
20s arms, and then Vegeta would smash his other absorbing orb so 20 would be 
powerless, then Gohan would power up a masenko and destroy 20s other arm, so 
he would run off to release the other androids, then Trunks would show up and 
tell everyone these were the wrong androids, so the Z fighters would get 
senzued because of all the energy lost by 20, then go to Dr. Geros lab. 
Vegeta would get there first, but 20 would have alredy relesed the androids, 
and they would have killed him, and Vegeta would challenge 17 because he 
killed 20, so 18 and 16 would be fighting Piccolo, Gohan, Tein and Trunks 
because 20 was worried about the Z teams power, so he made 16 want to fight 
all of them. So Vegeta would fire a Gammit Gun and and then thousands of ki 
blasts, which 17 would dodge, so Vegeta would throw punches and kicks wildly 
at 17 and he would block them. <BR><BR>
      Menwhile Tein would be going all out with tri-beams and Piccolo would 
be fireing S.B.C.s here and there, 16 would randomly be hit and minor pain 
would be induced until Gohan and Trunks would team up and fight him. Trunks 
would kick 16 in the head then Gohan would elbow 16's ribs, so 16 would fire 
a hells flash and send them into mountians breaking Trunks's leg, and then he 
would choke Piccolo and then fire another hells flash through his throat and 
this would cause Gohan to go SS and attack 16 matching him blow for blow and 
then fire a masenko the size of his kamehameha in the Cell game, this would 
kill 16, so now he would be drained and Trunks would fight 18, but he would 
be slowed down by his bleeding limb and he would pull out his sword and she 
would block it breaking his sword in half, so he would use his spikes to dig 
them into 18s arm and it would be limp but she would swing it over Trunks and 
hit him hard on the head knocking him unconsious, so Piccolo and Tein would 
run away with Gohan and Trunks while Kururin and Yamcha would take over and 
only last for a few minutes so they would run away and watch Vegeta and 17 
duke it out, they would still be even, but Vegeta would fly away, and when 17 
chases him he would turn around and head butt him in the chest and 17 would 
fall down, but he and 18 would team up and kick Vegeta in the head while 
another would knee him in the gut and he would lose SS and the androids would 
leave the beaten Z crew in search of Goku.<BR><BR> 
      They would get healed by the senzus and then Piccolo would leave to 
fuse with Kami, and then rest of the Z team would go to Gokus and move him to 
Roshis Island. Gohan and Trunks would train with Tein and Yamcha, and then 
they would here of Cell absorbing cities,a dnKami would agree to fuse with 
Piccolo, and he would leave. Trunks Gohan and Vegeta would also leave. When 
the sayins arrive they would all go SS and start to battle Cell, Gohan would 
fire an eye beam at Cell and Vegeta, an ultiamte skill, these would hit  one 
of Cells legs and he would power up and start to beat up Gohan and Vegeta, 
but then Trunks would fire a super powered Burning attack, and that would 
destroy Cells other leg, but he would fire a kamehameha to go through Vegetas 
lung and he would almost die, then Trunks would go mad and head butt Cell in 
the head and his head would be smashed, so he would use his tail to attack, 
Gohan would be dodgeing it, but it would hit him and his arm would be 
absorbed, and Cell would try the same on Trunks but Piccolo would show up and 
fire a S.B.C. destroying his tail, leaving him weakened and defenseless, so 
Piccolo would heal Vegeta and all of them would fire their strongest attacks 
killing Cell. <BR><BR>
      Then Piccolo would go off on search of the androids, and he would find 
them at Gokus house, by now Goku would be healed and go off to kill android 
16, 17, and 18. He would use his instant transmission to find Piccolo and 
they would take on the androids, he would use a kao-ken 30x to destroy 16, 
while Piccolo would be equal to 17 like the series, then Goku would use a 8x 
kao-ken to fight 18, and they would be even until he went USS which he 
aquired after getting better from the heart virus. He would then easily kill 
18 and then he would help Piccolo with 17, by now Piccolo would be using all 
his energy into one attack, that would severly hurt 17, but he would continue 
fighting anyway, so Goku would then take over for Piccolo andkill 17 with a 
kao-ken 50x. The world would be safe, and Trunks would leave and save his own 
time. <BR><BR>
      Years later when the world tournament would start the Z team would 
join and it would go like this:<BR><BR>
Round 1 Goku vs Vegeta <BR>
Goku and Vegeta would both go SS2 which they learned during the 7 years of 
peace, they would each start to throw punches and kicks going slow looking 
pretty equal, until Goku went SS3 and would use a Choun Kamehameha on Vegeta 
who would try to block it with a Big bang, but Gokus beam would be 
overpowering and he would knock out Vegeta and win the match. <BR><BR>
Round 2 Piccolo vs. Tein <BR>
Piccolo would be around Gokus strength, and Tein would be just behind him, he 
would fire millions of tri-beams which would barley hurt Piccolo, so Tein 
would fire a Kikhuo and use up all his energy and faint. <BR><BR>
Round 3 Yamcha vs Kururin <BR>
Yamcha would use a wolfs fang fist to hit Kururin in the head, then Kururin 
would use a distructo disk to cut off Yamchas arm, but he would regenerate, 
and both would fire a kamehameha, Kururins would be a slight margin ahead of 
Yamchas and he would send Yamcha flying out of the ring. <BR><BR>
Round 4 Gohan vs. Mr. Satan <BR>
like in the Cell games Gohan would let Satan puch him and kick him, but doing 
no real damage, then he would go SS3 and his energy would make Satan say I 
give up. <BR><BR>
Match 5 Goku vs. Piccolo <BR>
Goku would go SS and Piccolo would fire a S.B.C, but Goku would dive 
headfirst into it and shatter the beam, so he would use a small spirit bomb 
to hurt Piccolo, then they would start a fist fight Goku would use a kao-ken 
3x attack to blow a hole through Piccolo chest and then Piccolo would use an 
eye beam to cut through Gokus leg, but he would regenerate and fly off, so 
Piccolo would follow him, until Goku used a foot kamehameha to blast at 
Piccolos head, and Piccolo would fall out of the ring. <BR><BR>
Match 6 Kururin vs. Gohan <BR>
Gohan would go SS3 and fire a rapid masenko blast that would destroy the 
stadium wall and Kururin would be knocked out. <BR><BR>
Match 7 Goku vs. Gohan <BR>
Both would go SS 2, but only Goku would go SS3 and Gohan would just dodge his 
dad for a few minutes, then fire millions of ki blasts and him, surrounding 
Goku, then Gohan would make them explode. Goku would be hurt, but would use a 
super kao-ken to dig his knuckle into Gohans arm, so Gohan would use the 
Instant Transmission to get behind Goku and fire a ki blast and he would fly 
into the wall, but Goku would then hit the ground because he lost all his 
energy while in SS 3. So Gohan would win the 25 world tournament, but there 
would be the kids tournament, and I'm only covering the one good fight.<BR><BR>
Goten vs. Trunks <br>
Goten would start of the fight with a kao-ken 2x that he learned from Goku, 
and then he would kick Trunks in the gut and use the kamekameha, and then 
Trunks would use his burning attack that would only ip up Gotens shirt, then 
Goten would fire a tri-beam and Trunks would be knocked out for 8 seconds, so 
Goten would fire a masenko that would knock Trunks out for 3 seconds, so then 
they would go SS, but Goten who now was much stronger than Trunks would go 
SS2 and would use him as a punching bag, so Trunks would give up and Goten 
would win the kids tournament. <BR><BR>
      Later Babidi would show up and try to steal the Z fighters energy, but 
they would find his ship and go through the levels, first Goten would fight 
Puipui and when Babidi turned up the gravity , Goten wouldn' notice the 
difference because he trained up to 40x gravity, and he would kill Puipui. 
Next Goku would fight Yakon and kill him as easily as in the series. So when 
Gohan fights Daruba he would have been in constant training he would kill him 
with a kamehameha that would release Buu, but SS3 Goku and Gohan+SS 2 Vegeta 
Goten+SS Trunks they would easily take on Buu, but they wouldn't be enough 
because Buu could regenerate, and Goku and Gohan lost SS3 and were worn out, 
so Buu would leave and start absorbing people, and then when he makes friend 
with Satan and Bee and then they are killed and he goes into Thin Buu and 
Good Buu, Vegeta and Good Buu would team up and fire their strongest attacks 
that would kill afew people and Buu would leave and go absorb enough people 
to go to Super Evil Majin Buu, and he would nearly kill the Z crew. So they 
would go to Kaioshins and train. <BR><BR>
      So they would get the fusion earings and learn the fusion dance, so 
when they leave Gohan and Goku use the fusion earings and go into Gokan, 
while Goten and Trunks fuse into Gotenks, and Yamcha and Tein go into Teincha 
and they go to fight Buu, but Vegeta and Piccolo get absorbed and he becomes 
stronger than the fusion dance Z warriors, and they leave while Gokan fights 
S.E.M. Buu, and he uses a Masenko Kamehameha Spirit Bomb, which is half 
Masenko half kamehameha and is surrounded by spirit bombs, that cuts Buu in 
half, but then Buu absrobs Gokuan and then tracks down the other fusions, and 
absorbs them, and like in the series the fusions wear off and Buu spits them 
out, and everyone holds off Buu tell Goku makes a spirit bomb that kills Buu. <BR><BR>
      Later in GT when Bebi comes to earth Ubuu and Buu are stronger than 
Bebi because of the training with Goku because he was much stronger, and 
Goten and Trunks can fight against Bebi, but he takes over Pan and then Gohan 
and then Vegeta, but when Ubuu shows up he fires a kamehameha that is equal 
to his destroyer bomb, and then he uses a kao-ken 5x to over take Vegeta and 
then he punches Vegeta in the gut and he kicks Vegeta in the head, but Bebi 
then orders Gohan and Goten to attack Ubuu, and Trunks shows up to helps Ubuu 
, then Goku comes and turns SS4 and beats up Bebi-Vegeta, and then loses 
power, and leaves, then Vegeta goes Golden Ozuar and kicks Goku in the back, 
and tackles him, with his immense weight he crushes Goku, and then Piccolo 
and Tein come and cut off his tail, then they Ubuu and Trunks take on Vgeta 
with their major attacks, and Goku wakes up and goes SS4 and kills Bebi, and 
saves the planet. <BR><BR>
      When 17 is released Goku never goes to hell and faces him,then he and 
Goten who is as tall as him now fuse into Gotu and use a tri-kamehameha that 
kills artifical 17, while Vegeta and Gohan fuse into Goheta and use a final 
flash kamehameha to kill android 17, Piccolo and Teincha team up and fire the 
S.B.C and kamedodonha to destroy Freeza, then 18 16, and their artificals 
fuse and they overpower all of the fusions easily, until SS4 Goku comes and 
fights Super 18, but she uses her Ultra hells flash to damage Goku, but he 
flys at 18 and fires a volley of ki blasts at her and destroys one of her 
arms, then Vegeta and Gohan fire their big bang and kamehameha to destroys 
her, Super 16 would vicously attack the unfused warriors who were worn out 
and they gave their energy to Goku who used a dragonfist to kill him. <BR><BR>
      When they summon the dragon to resurect the dead they all go in 
different directions, and Goku would follow the one star ball, and since he 
hadn't fused with the dragonballs he was killed by Gokus dragonfist, Gohan 
would track down most of the other balls and get their dragonballs, until Suu 
of the fourstar ball was left, and Goku would go SS4 and Goku and Vegeta 
would try and fight him, but he would be to hot since he was fire, and they 
would attack with far away blasts and he would die and the world would be 
left in peace. 
<BR><BR>



<b>What if Gohan went Super Sayin during the training for the androids ?  
By:<a href="mailto:Barfster001@aol.com ">Barfster001@aol.com 
</a></b>
<br><br>
During the first year of training he would achieve SS. Then his 
strength would double and Goku would tell Vegeta that Gohan was a Super 
Sayin, and Vegeta would train with Goku and become a Super Sayin very 
quickly. Piccolo and Vegeta would spar continualy unlike Goku and Gohan who 
would learn new techniques and slowly progress. Kururin, Yamcha, and Tein 
would stop by every few weeks and see their increasing strength and train 
even harder. During the second year Goku would come down with his heart 
disease and be healed by Trunkses medicne. Then at the end of three years 
they would all go to an island 9 miles southwest of south city. Bulma would 
be there with Trunks and Goten (who was born a month after trunks in this 
time period), and a scouter that she made because Vegeta wanted to know the 
powers of Kakarot and the androids. When 19 and 20 show up Gohan would fly 
off with one of the scouters and go towards a power of 10,000, (it was only 
10,000 because you can't see an androids power, but the poer of the people 
they absorb). He wold find 20 and begin to fight him and use a kamehameha, 
but he would absorb it and his power on the scouter would sky rocket to 
100,000. Gohan would run away to get Goku, Vegeta, and Piccolo to warn them 
about the androids, but Goku would fly off to tell Kururin, Yamcha, and Tein 
and see a power of 4,000,000. That was 19 absorbing Kururin, Yamcha, and 
Tein. So Goku would find them and go to get senzus. 20 would go to find 
Piccolo while Goku and Gohan left while Vegeta was storming the city for 19. 
He would sneak up on him and drain Piccolo to near death, but Vegeta would 
show up and kick 20 in the face and he would rum away. When Goku and Gohan 
would show up they would heal everyone and 19 and 20 would come back to 
absorb everyones power. But Trunks would show up and tell them these weren't 
the real androids, but 19 and 20 would attack Trunks and absorb his power to 
become as strong as 17 and 18. Gohan, Goku, and Vegeta would start a fist 
fight and eventualy be beaten. 20 being overconfiedent wuld run off to awaken 
16,17, and 18. Gohan, Piccolo, Trunks, and Goku would stay to fight 19, while 
Vegeta, Tien, Yamcha, and Kururin would go to stop 20. Tien would find 20 and 
fight him, but lose, then Vegeta would come and fire a big bang to damage 20. 
Then he would go to his lab and awaken the androids, then they would go to 
destroy the Z fighters. But all of them would have run to Roshis Island and 
hide for a few days. Then Cell would show up and Piccolo would run off to 
fuse with Kami. He would be strong enough to kill Cell, but would hear all 
the info about him like in the series. Gohan would come to help and almost 
kill him, but Cell would use a Tri beam and keep Gohan and Piccolo at bay 
until Android 20 arrives and is amazed that Cell is hear until he hears about 
everything. 20 promises to give Cell 17, and 18 but Piccolo goes to find them 
and tell them 20 is going to betray them. So 16, 17, and 18 run off and 
Piccolo has to fight 19. Now it gets a little insane. Goku, Gohan, Vegeta, 
and the humans have to find Cell with the scouters, and 19 runs away to get 
the androids, and Piccolo is all alone trying to track down 19 and the 
androids while trying to kill Cell so he dosen't absorb 17 and 18. Goku and 
everyone are only trying to kill 20 because he's leading Cell to the 
androids, but 19 dosen't know that or about Cell, he's only trying to kill 
them. Told you it was a hard plot to follow. So days later the world has 
become an empty place and Cells scouter power has become 8,000,000. So Chi 
Chi, Bulma, Chibi Trunks, and Goten are told to stay in the room of spirit of 
time. Then Gohan finds 20 and Goku faces off with Cell but are easily 
defeated. So everyone goes to the room of spirit and time and train for one 
day. Gohan and Future Trunks go first. When a day passes Gohan and Trunks 
have discovered USS. And they go off to kill 20. Piccolo and Tein go next. 
Meanwhile Goku trains Goten and Chibi Trunks since they are 3, like Gohans 
age in the japanse version. Gohan and Trunks find 20 and Cell and go USS and 
easily kill 20, but Cell uses a spirit bomb to defeat Trunks, then uses a 
kao-ken to overpower Gohan, but Gohan having learned the attacks Goku, 
Piccolo, and Vegeta uses a kao-ken and kamehameha to destoy most of Cell, but 
his head, legs, and body are left and he regenerates. Then Trunks uses a 
Burning Attack to destroy his tail. Cell worried about being killed flies off 
and tries to find the androids. 19 already having found the androids powers 
up and lets Cell see his dissapearing energy since he hasn't absorbed alot of 
energy in days. Cell senses his dieing energy  goes off, but Piccolo and Tien 
get out of the room of spirit and time and go off to fight Cell. Gohan and 
Trunks meanwhile are trying to find Piccolo and Tien to help them. When Cell 
finds then androids and tells them 20 is dead 19 immediatly goes to absorb 
Cells energy, but Cell absorbs 19, and then Tien and Piccolo show up. Piccolo 
holds his own against Cell while Tien can only take on 17 and 18. 16 then 
tries to kill Tien but Trunks shows up and knockes out 16 the Cell chokes 
Piccolo and absorbs 17. Now he overpowers Piccolo, Tien and Trunks but Gohan 
runs away with 16 and 18. Cell then tries to kill Tien, Piccolo, and Trunks, 
but Goku comes and takes evreyone to Kamis. Cell goes on a rampage and fires 
thousands of ki blasts at citys destroying the world. Goku enraged would go 
to Namek and get Dende to be a guardian and make new dragonballs and then 
goes into the room of time and spirit with Vegeta. Gohan then brings the 
androids to Kamis and 16 immediatly starts fighting the Z soldiers. When Goku 
and Vegeta get out they tell Yamcha and Kururin to go in. Then Cell shows up 
at the bottom of Korins Tower and android 16 and 18 come down to chase Goku 
who left to find the dragonballs. He absorbs 18 and then runs off destroying 
more cities. So then when Goku finds all of them he wishes that all people 
would come back that were killed by the androids and Cell and his second was 
to granted after Cell was killed. Then Cell would start to talk about the 
Cell games, but the sayins except for Goku would be foolish enough to fight 
Cell. So Vegeta and Trunks would double team him and begin to fire their 
energy attacks to hurt Cell, then Cell uses a Masenkeo that slices off 
Vegetas arm, then they both go USS and start a fist fight, but they start to 
slow down and Cell gains the upper hand and elbows Trunks in the ribs 
finishing him, Gohan afraid would run off with them and get healed. So then 
they all train for another day in the room of spirit and time and then train 
in the outer world. But Goku would be relaxed and train Goten so he's at 200 
and Vegeta trains Trunks so he's at 165. They begin to train themselves in 
little sparing matches and learn the "Kamekameha"(how Goten pronounces 
Kamehameha) and Burning attack. Then when the Cell games begin Mr. Satan and 
his krones lose and then Trunks steps up, he starts with a volley of gigantic 
red energy balsts that hit Cell, but barley hurst him. Then Cell uses a Dodan 
Wave and the blast goes through Trunks heart, so Vegeta would be enraged and 
start to fire big bangs wildly at Cell and destroy and arm that is quickly 
grown back. So Goku comes in and immediatly goes USS and shows Cell he became 
speedier in this form and now has an edge over Cell. So the real show begins 
as Goku pounds Cell to the ground and then Cell fires a Kamehameha and Goku 
counters it and its like the one with Gohan vs. Cell, but Goku then uses a 
kao-ken times 30 and destroys Cell. But he comes back because of a brain cell 
and is now even stronger, so he forfets and Gohan comes in and goes SS 2, 
which he learned in the room of spirit and time. Then because of all his 
training he goes SS 3 and automaticaly kills Cell, but he once again 
regenerates and is nearly as strong as Gohan, but Gohan punches his so hard 
he releases 18 and 17. Now Cell tries to re absorb the andrids, but Gohan 
stops him and then Cell absorbs Goku and becomes near his complete forms 
power, so Gohan kills him for real and the whole world thinks Gohans a hero. 
So then Trunks is revived by Gokus last wish, and android 17 and 18 are made 
humans. In the other world tournamet everything is the same except Kai is 
alive, and when the World tournamet happens Gohan beats everyone, and Goten 
wins the kids tournament. When Buu shows up Goku comes back and everything is 
the same until Gohan trains with Kaioshin and becomes even stronger. And Goku 
and Gohan are able to fuse since Gohan could hold off Buu tell Goku showed up 
and fuse into Gohu ande uses an attack that is a cross with the special beam 
cannon and kamehameha which is actualy a masenko wrapped around a kamehameha.

In GT Bebi is killed by Goten and Gohan who left with Goku, the 17 saga 
didn't happen, and no evil wishes were made s the shenlong saga dosn't happen.

<b>What If Goku hadn't been sent to Earth?

<br><br>
Goku would have been sent to another planet with low levels, like Yardrat. So 
Goku would have grownup with the Yardrats(the people who taught Goku the 
Instant Transmission) and get very strong while learning th I.T. So later 
Goku would destroy the world and return to Freeza, and begin training with 
Radditz, Vegeta, and Nappa. Gokus power would be around 80,000 because of all 
the training learning the I.T. So later when the Freeza Saga should have 
happened the Sayins travel to earth hearing of some high powers. It turns out 
to be Yamcha, Tein, Kururin, and Piuccolo Diamo. They are around 3 to 400,000 
beacuse Piccolo had killed them and they trained with King Kai, and they 
beacme friends while training. Meanwhile Piccolo would have been taking over 
Earth and geting very strong. Then Bulma would wish back the strong warriors 
that tried to fight Piccolo. Then when Goku and everyone arrive Piccolo and 
the humans easily kill all of Freezas men, and Goku is only around 200,000 so 
he easily gets pounded. Vegeta, Nappa, and Radditz also defeated so Feeza 
leaves the planet saying I'll leave you Sayins hear so you can toughen up. So 
Goku and Vegeta run leaving Nappa and Radditz to struggle with broken bones, 
and torn limbs. Kururin being soft gives them sensuz to heal themselves and 
then Nap. and Rad. swear to kill Goku and Vegeta. But they would train for a 
few years and eventually kill Nappa and Raditz. Then they would act like 
friends to the Z soldiers and begin finding out their secrets. Later Goku 
would convince them that Freeza was going to destroy the Earth soon so they 
would go to Freeza planet 79 and wait tell he arrives then kill the Ginyu 
force and start to trash Freeza but they don't make passed his 2nd form so he 
heals them and thinks the Z warriors brainwashed them. So now Vegeta is at 
800,000 and Goku's at 1,000,000. SO they kill the Z warriors and then serve 
Freeza for a few more years and train and secretly become SS. Then on a 
mission to Namek when Freeza hears of the Dragonballs Vegta kills all of 
Freezas men and Goku catches Freeza off guard and kills him. Then King Kold 
comes and they serve him for awhile and betray him to and kill him. Now they 
go to Earth and start destroying the world, then they destroy the world and 
keep killing the remanets of Freeza and destroy planets until they get very 
old and die.

<br>
    After the losers fight Vegeta would go first. It would be a long fight and 
after losing in SS mode he would go Ultra SS. His power would be about the 
same as Goku's when first coming out of the time chamber. So now Vegeta would 
tire Cell out but get beaten. Now Cell would want Tien to come up because he 
knew Tien was very weak and could rest, but Tien would use his multi form and 
Tri beam to tick Cell off so much that he would actualy start fighting and 
kick Tiens butt. Next would be Piccolo who would keep regenerating to once 
again tire cell out and then lose. Now cell would call Yamcha who is weaker 
than Tien and has no major attacks so after a buch of wolf fang fists Trunks 
would since Cells growing power so he tells Yamcha to say I give up. So now 
Trunks would step up to Cell and Cell would be PO'ed at this but is now very 
rested. So Trunks at Ultra SS would have a bit more power than Vegeta and 
would have a Goku vs. Cell like fight, but Cell wouldn't warm up or play 
around and after awhile kill trunks. Gohan and Goku would be so ticked that 
they would go SS2. Goku would try to fight but Cell would proceed to kill 
Vegeta Piccolo Kururin Chaitzu Tien and 16. This would be enough for both of 
them to go SS3 and easily kill cell forever. Later they would wish for 
everyone back and at the start of the Buu Saga Majin Vegeta would be killed 
by an Ultimate Kamehameha which would provide enough energy to realese Buu. 
Goten would be much stronger than Trunks because Goku would train him and 
when they fused they would kill Buu. During the baby saga Uubu would also be 
strong enough to hold his own against baby the first time SS 4 would be 
discovered during the training time between the Buu and Baby Saga so Vegeta 
would died once again and keep the 17's from escaping hell but since people 
were still killed alot the Shenlong saga would still happen, but Gohan would 
be stronger than Vegeta and would have to Goku's fusion partner since Vegeta 
was dead. They would form Gokanu who would have a body ressembilling Gohans 
but when SS4 ressembiling Gogeta. Gokanu would kill all shenlongs easily and 
with Gohans brain would think to kill Ii Shenlong when he kill's Suu shenlong 
for the dragonball. Thereafter all shelongs would be dead and peace would be 
restored and Goku still alive. Wow all that happened just because Goku didn't 
want to fight first.

<b>What if  Yamcha Tein and Chautzu also participated in the fight with Frieza 
on Namek? 
By:<a href="mailto:Barfster001@aol.com ">Barfster001@aol.com

<br><br>
First off they would all be in different places Piccolo would be close to 
Yamcha and after Piccolo absorbes Nail They would take off Tein would be near 
Gohan and Kurirun and Then Vegeta would go and get armor for everyone who was 
wished back. At this point Chautzu would be near The Eldest Namek and  take 
off for Tien when he senced power. Then Frieza would show up and Vegeta would 
fight him with the help of Tien, so now frieza would have the $hit beaten out 
of him. So he would go to his second form and still lose to Tien. Now Piccolo 
and Yamcha would show up. They would nearly kill Frieza and he'd go to his 
3rd form, but he was so weak he still isn't that strong so he poweres up to 
his 4th form. During this time Vegeta would Be shot by Kururin twice so he 
would be around Goku's strength but a little weaker. So No Goku shows up and 
together Vegeta and Goku beat up frieza so Frieza immediatly goes to 100 % 
power and nearly kills Goku. So he takes a senzu bean and is near SS power. 
So Frieza no nearly killes Vegeta and he's near SS power . But Friza runs to 
his ship and calls his dad. So after hours of but kicken King Kold Shows up 
and kills Dende and Kuruirn, and nearly kills Gohan Piccolo Tien and Yamcha 
then Chautsu Blows up barely hurting Kold now Gokus Pssed and goes SS. So now 
Vegeta is pissed sening  Goku's new power and goes SS, now their powers are 
around the Android saga when fighting 19 & 20. So they easily kill everyone. 
Trunks shows up blah blah blah everyones killed tell the Buu saga when Goku 
and Vegeta go SS 3 and kill him before the mass genocide attack. Bebi dosen't 
really happen and Super 17 is a small challenge and because everyone isn't 
killed the Shenlong saga dosen't happen.

<b>What if Gohan fought Cell before Goku?  
By:<a href="mailto:Barfster001@aol.com ">Barfster001@aol.com 
</a></b>
<br><br>
This goes back to when Goku and Gohan just get out of the time 
chamber. When Goku went to see Cell Gohan would follow him. After hearing 
Goku say Cell could kill him Gohan would vow to fight before Goku to weaken 
Cell. Now all the Z warriors would be scared, because Goku wouldn't be there 
to fight Cell first and destroy him. So evryone would train much harder and 
become even stronger than they were in the Cell games,and Gohan would spend 
all of the 9 days training with Goku, and learn the Kaio-ken and 
instantanious movement. When the Cell games would arrive and gohan would just 
show a little of his strenght to Mr. Satan so he could go first. It would 
start off like Gokus fight but after the warm up Cell wouldn't know of Gohans 
hidden powers and begin to beat him. Goku would begin to worry and want to 
fight Cell, but Gohan would keep his vow, and then fire hundreds of ki blasts 
and hurt Cell. So now Cell would be ticked off and power up a huge Kamehameha 
at Gohan, but Gohan using the Instantanious movement to save himself. Then 
Cell would try a Gamit Gun that Gohan would also dodge it. So now Cell would 
be low on energy, and powerup to full power. Goku, and Piccolo would get 
scared for Gohans sake and try to fight Cell, so Cell would unleash his Cell 
jrs. for them to fight. Even thought the Z fighters were stronger only the 
Sayins could defend themselves against their power. So Gohan would want to 
help but Cell would make 5 more Cell jrs. to preocupie Gohan. Goku at full 
strength would have helped destroy most of the Cell jrs. except for 16's and 
Kururin's. But then he would see Gohan, with a lost arm, and a bloody face. 
Enraged he would go SS 2 and destroy all of the Cell jrs., and give Gohan a 
senzu, so Gohans power would nearly double and be at his SS 2 power. So 
Gohan, and Goku would teamup, and kill Cell. But he regenerates to become 
stronger than Goku. Cell would now make more Cell Jrs. to attack Gohan so he 
could have just enough time to kill Goku. 16 also mad would self detonate, 
and this time it would work because Bulma didn't take it out, because Kururin 
told Bulma that 16 wouldn't kill Goku. So Gohan would use his Instantanious 
movement to transport them to the middle of snakeway so King Kai wouldn't 
die. But like in the show Cell would regenterate, and be much stronger. 
Losing his father and 16 would cause Gohan to go SS 2, and kill Cell with 
little effort. Then the dragonballs would be summoned and 16 would come back 
and Goku would remain dead. There would then be few differences in the rest 
of the series, except 16 would be a Z fighter, and he would train with Gohan, 
so Gohan would be strong enough to kill Daruba, Goku would be a bit stronger, 
and would win the afterlifer tournamet easily, and Goten, Trunks, and Vegeta 
would be stronger so they could keep up with Gohan.

<b>What if Trunks and Vegeta got out of the Room of time and spirit before cell 
absorbed 17 during the battle of Piccolo and 17?

</a></b>
<br>
Well Trunks would see Goku and ask him if anything happened so Goku would 
tell Trunks about 17 and Piccolo fighting. Vegeta would not listen and go of 
in a different direction but would take the offered senzu bean. Trunks would 
then get to the island where piccolo was fighting 17 and fight 18 and 16. 
Vegeta would cross the city with 1st form cell in it and begin fighting him 
with little trouble, after a few minutes he would let cell absorb some of his 
energy so he would be at half the strength of cell in his perfect form so the 
bttle would turn to cells favor because Vegeta was weakend. So cell would get 
Vegeta near death and then Vegeta would remember the senzu bean and take it 
and get stronger with his sayin biology. Now he would be a little stronger 
than in the cell games and would easily kill cell. Then he would notice the 
high energy levels of Trunks and go to the island of the fight. By this time 
trunks would have destoyed 16 and would now be fighting 17 and 18 because 
piccolo ran out of energy to fight. But cell was still alive and he went to 
the island and because he had sayin biology he was nearly at his 3rd form 
power and beat Trunks and absorbed 17 and 18 and now had the power of Super 
Perfect Cell so Vegeta came and also got badly beaten. Goku would show up and 
take everyone to the sky palace to get healed. So after the 10 days the cell 
game happens Gohan is able to alredy go SS2 and is equal to cell and goku 
killes cell by using the spirit bomb. <BR><BR>

<b>What if Goku never hit his head and lost his memories?  
By:<a href="mailto:Barfster001@aol.com ">Barfster001@aol.com 
</a></b>
<br>
After reading that short reoprt by Mark Wilson heres what probably happened 
in greater contrast. Goku would continue to be violent and would be trained 
under his grandpa. so when he was 12 he would be strong enough and kill him. 
This is when Bulma shows up, so she tells him about the dragonballs and he 
agrees to be her bodyguard with the intention to grant his own wish. So later 
when Roshi showes up he waits for the magic carpet to be cleaned because he 
couldn't ride the nimbus. Then he kills Olong,Yamcha, and tries to kill Ox 
King but he's to strong so he looks for the fan and learns the kamehameha. 
Then lays waist to Pilaf and wishes for a person stronger than him so he 
could train and spar against him. So at this time Kururin is made stronger. 
So he takes training from Roshi at day, and secretly spars with Kururin at 
night so they're both stronger. But later he kills both Kururin and Roshi and 
wins the Tenkanichi Budokia. So then he hears about the Red Ribbon army and 
destroys all of it except Tao and Black the new leader so Goku seeks Karin 
out and gets the Holy Water in one day and steals the God water and he kills 
Tao and Black. Later while running around the world he kills Tein and 
Chauitzu and wins the 22nd world tournament. Then Diamo shows up and he kills 
him and his men and goes up to Kains and wants to train with Kami so he gets 
the bell and he goes up to the tower only to see Popo so he decieds to fight 
him and loses badly so Goku spends the next few years training with Popo tell 
he kills him to. This is when Raditz shows up and Goku leaves earth conquring 
planets. Until all the sayins are stron enough they kill the Ginyus and 
Friezas men. Then Frieza hears about Namek and heads there with the sayins 
and they kill all of them easily until Nail shows up. Goku is now at the 
strenght of his gravity training bu  Nail is double his. Raditz and Nappa are 
about at Ginyus strenght and Vegeta is at the strenght of when he was healed 
after Recomme about 130,000. So Nail nearly kills them all and tells them to 
leave but they heal themselves and are much stronger. Goku is at 1,000,000 
vegeta 950,000 Nappa and Raditz around 600,000 and they kill Nail and then 
turn on frieza killing him. So then at the hands of king kold they kill more 
planets and hear of the androids on earth whos strenght is tripled of what it 
was. So they leave and get to eath only to see Cell in his final form and 
releasing and ultimate kamehameha relesing Buu with a fully grown Piccolo at 
his side. So Goku Manages to kill piccolo and holds of the Cell only to see 
Karin be killed, this is enough to make him go super Sayin and he kills Buu 
along with the androids(he is now much sronger after all that conquring about 
his strenght in the super 17 saga) and he kills everyone on the planet with a 
choun kamehameha and destoying earth.  <BR><BR>

<b>What if Pikkon was a Z fighter during DBZ?  
By:<a href="mailto:Barfster001@aol.com ">Barfster001@aol.com 
</a></b>
<br>
When Radditz would arrive at earth he would sense 2 powers thinking it was 
Goku and possibly his son. But he would only find Piccolo and Pikkon. Piccolo 
would be around 500 since Pikkon helped him train and Pikkon would be around 
550. So Radditz would be up for a fight after he explains who he is and the 2 
would use thir major attacks, the special beam cannon and the super thunder 
flash. Their energy combined would do alot of damage to Radditz and it would 
make Goku come with Gohan because he was on his way to Roshis. So now Goku 
would put Gohan in a safe place and join in with an ultimate kamehameha. Now 
Radditz would be near death and runaway but also takes Gohan hostage while 
Pikkon would explain about Radditz so Goku gets some sensus and talks to 
Kururin and Roshi. Then Pik. and Pic. find Radditz and power up so Goku can 
find them. After takeing some senzus they would take of their weights and 
fight Radditz. But Goku gets the $hit beaten out of him and Gohan gets mad 
enough to attack Radditz. Then Piccolo and Pikkon fire their attaks killing 
Radditz and accidentaly killing Goku then Radditz tells them about Vegeta and 
Nappa. A year later They show up and the Sabimen attack Pikkon steps in and 
easily kills all of them. Now during the year Pik. Pic. and Gohan trained 
together so they're around Gokus power. Then they finish Nappa and Vegeta 
gets freaked out and wants to wait until Goku comes. So when he arrives he 
tells the humans to leave. Then Goku starts off with a 3x Kaioken nearly 
killing Vegeta and leaving him to Gohan whose at 7,500 nd Vegetas now at 
9,500  but Vegeta makes a moon and only gets to 95,000 which Gokuy easily 
equals with a 3xkaioken and kamehameha. Then Gohan cuts off Vegetas tail and 
says <BR>
"Fine I'll go to Namek and get their Dragonballs." <BR>and then leaves to get 
healed. <BR>
So they immediatly get Kamis spaceship to stop Vegeta. One month laterthe 
whole Z team gets to namek. During the month all of them trained so they are 
all around the time of Gohans Guru power up. When they arrive they came a day 
before Freeza and get the first 5 dragonballs and his them nameks, and all 
recieve power ups so they're around the power of when they fight 4th form 
Freeza and easily kill all of Freezas men when Freeza summons the Ginyus and 
his Dad. They arrive hours later to find 4th form Freeza nearly dead. At this 
time Piccolo and Nail would fuse to be around the power of piccolo during the 
19 and 20 saga. Now wouldn't you know it Vegeta shows up (finaly). He and 
King kolds men face off. Vegeta wins and then procceds to kill most of the 
Ginyus, execpt Ginyu. He steals Gokus senzus and repeatly heals himself tell 
he's at the power of when kururin shots him and kills Ginyu. During this 
Freeza is killed and Pikkon, SS Goku, and SS Gohan fight Kold. They went SS 
because they believed Piccolo was dead, but everyone was just real tired and 
hid in the ship with the Nameks. Vegeta seeing a low class sayin and his half 
sayin son SS enrages him to go SS and he attacks, but Pikkon hold him off 
and. But king Kold is killed by a seak spirit bomb.Pikkon used his tondado 
attack to nearly kill Vegeta, and he admitts to join the Z fighters. When 
they come home a future Goten and Truks show up to warn Goku of a heats virus 
and and androids 16,17, and 18. So they train and when 19 and 20 show up 
Pikkon kills both very easily, and goes to stop Vegeta from freeing the 
others after Goten and Trunks show up. But Vegta gets there first and frees 
them all and fights 18 then Goku comes in and fights 16 and Trunks Goten and 
Gohan fight 17. After 16 defeats Goku he assits 17 with the 3 SS. Vegeta gets 
help from Pikkon and Piccolo and Defeats 18 with a Big Bang. After all the 
android run away because of a triple kamehameha from Goten, Gohan, and 
Kururin. Tein and Yamcha tail them and Goahn notices Goku looks sick and 
Goten says this his the hearts virus. So Kururuin takes him home. 10 days 
later Cell shows up and pikkon and piccolo investigate and are and even match 
for Cell. After Cell tells everything Vegeta shows up and gets into a huge 
fight with Cell destroying the deserted city. After Vegeta has his arm 
absorbed he runs away leaving Gohan to come in and battle Cell. Now Goku gets 
healed and goes off to help Gohan while Piccolo goes off to merge with Kami. 
After the merge his power is around his Cell game power and tries to find the 
androids. After a beaten Cell flees Goku decieds to use the Hyperbolic 
timechamber and Vegeta and Trunks go in first. After Piccolo finds the 
androids he fights 16 and 17 while Pikkon easily toys with 18. They are able 
to keep their power levels so low that a day passes and Goku and Gohan go in 
and Vegeta and Trunks seek Cell. But cell passes over the battle and assits 
18 with Pikkon But after a Super Thunder Flash he "kills"  Cell. Then Goten 
goes in the Hyperbolic time chamber and Goku and Gohan go to Kaious and learn 
the Instant transmission. After a day of that they teleport to the island and 
Goten shows up after Cell has absorbed both android and 16 helps fight final 
form cell, but Cell anounces the Cell games in 9 days so everyone goes back 
to kamis and trains some more. In the Cell games Goku kills cell with little 
difficulty and in the Boo saga all of Babidis men are killed and their is 
peace in the world. <BR>
P.S. I didin't include the GT because gokus never a kid so the don't give 
energy to bebi which stops the 17 saga and since the balls aren't used the

<br>If Frieza had killed Gohan instead of Krillin after being hit by the Spirit 
Bomb Goku, Piccolo, and Krillin would be royally PO'ed. Krillin and Piccolo 
would attack Frieza in a rage and distract him long enough for Goku to go 
Super Saiyan. Goku would show no mercy and kill Frieza without hesitation. 
Gohan would be wished back with the Nameks. The entire team would go back to 
earth without any difficulty. King Cold would come to earth seeking revenge 
and be destroyed by Trunks and Goku. Because of Frieza's death Cell would be 
slightly weaker do to the fact that he doesn't have Frieza's cell. Goku would 
have King Kai send Dende to earth to create new Dragon Balls.  The rest of 
the series would go on the same until Cell knocked out Tien. Because Goku 
doesn't know the Instant Transmission Tien would be killed but Goku would 
sneek to the island to get Piccolo. Cell would see him and a fight would 
commence. Cell would have more power than Goku and would slowly gain the 
advantage. Sensing that Goku was in danger and that he was the only person he 
could depend on Gohan would go Super Saiyan and fly to help Goku. Together 
Goku and Gohan would match up against Cell. Vegeta and Trunks would come out 
of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber and go after Cell. Their arrival at the fight 
makes Cell realize he has no chance in winning so he would use the Solar 
Flare to blind them all so he can go after Android 18. Vegeta would like to 
fight Cell's perfect form so he would tell where she is hiding which would 
cause Trunks to fight Vegeta. Goku being experienced at power sensing would 
try to stop Cell. Having only a weakened Goku and Gohan to fight Cell would 
easily get hold of Android 18 and would go to his perfect form. After 
defeating Trunks and Vegeta Goku would fight Cell and tell Gohan to get away 
with Piccolo and train in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. Goku would 
self-destruct in an attempt to kill Cell but would fail. Gohan and Piccolo 
would train in the Chamber. Android 16 would lose his objective because Goku 
is dead and would self-destruct to kill Cell. Cell would regenerate and be 
even more powerful. Cell would absorb Vegeta and Trunks and several cities 
before Gohan would be done in the chamber. Piccolo and Gohan would fight Cell 
but Piccolo would be easily killed. Gohan would be mad enough about 
everyone's death to go SS2. In the final Kamehameha match Gohan would pull 
through with out any help because his arm wouldn't be injured. Gohan would 
use the Earth Dragon Balls to wish back everyone except Vegeta, Goku, and 
Tien. Using the second wish to get to Namek Gohan would wish back Vegeta, 
Piccolo, and Tien. Goku would stay in the Next Dimension so he could train 
and keep the world out of danger. Gohan would have Bulma pick him up in a 
spaceship to return home. Goku would see how valuble the Instant Transmission 
is and learn the Instant Transmission from King Kai and the rest of the 
series would progress the original way.
