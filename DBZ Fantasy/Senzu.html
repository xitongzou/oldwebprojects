      <p>The Senzu bean is made by Korin in Korin's Tower. It is a special bean 
        that has the power to revive a damaged body and return it to its previous 
        form.<br>
        <br>
        In the case of the Saiyans, every time they are beat to near-death like 
        Vegeta on Nemek he was so close to death that when Dendea healed him his 
        health doubled from what it was before and if he had took a Senzu Bean 
        it would have done the same thing.</p>
