<H3 align="center">Here is my list of Fusions/Merges</H3>
<font size=2 color=blue>
<h4>Namekian Fusion</h4>
<p>This fusion is done by placing the hand on the nameks chest and then is then 
  is absorbed into the nameks chest and then they are fused</p>
<p>Piccolo + Nail = Piccolo (Piccolo is the base and it looks exactly like him)</p>
<p>Piccolo + Kami = Kamiccolo (Actually it makes Piccolo but this is what Goku 
  called him when he first saw the fusion)</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Fusion Dance</h4>
<p>This is done by doin' a cool dance, they turn out in a cool fusion clothing, this only last for 30 min. The positions and movements have to be just right or else you end up mutated.</p>
<p>Goten + Trunks = Gotenks</p>
<p>Goku + Vegeta = Gogeta</p>
<p>Goku + Vegeta = fat Gogeta (This happened because of a mistake in the dance)</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Potara Earrings</h4>
<p>When the two warriors wear the Potara Earrings on opposite ears, and then they immediately get pulled together in a fusion. This 
  fusions result is different from the others because their voice, clothes, and 
  looks combine, and they cannot unfuse(because it's supposed to be permenant). Characters that fuse:</p>
<p>Vegeta + Goku = Vegetto (They manage to unfuse when they were absorbed by Buu)<br>
<p><h4>Other Fusions</h4>
<p>Other Characters that fuse:</p>
<p>Artificial 17 + Android 17 = Super Android 17<br>
