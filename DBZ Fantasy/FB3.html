Son Goku thought he lived a normal life, as an Earthling. But, he soon was to be 
reminded, that he was an alien that had a brother. Goku didn't want to accept 
it, so, his brother threatened him with his only son. After Radditz stole his 
brother's son, he left and went to his space ship. Piccolo had already 
encountered Radditz, and, knew that Goku would need help. However, he told Goku 
that he didn't want to help him; he just wanted to help Goku so this man could 
be gone and he could try and destroy the world again. They fly off, hoping that 
both of their goals will be met. </font> </span></p>

Piccolo and Goku are on the battlefield. Radditz has total confidence he will 
win. The hero's son is crying and locked away in a space pod. This can only be 
DBZ. The exchanges of blows are made, with Radditz being in the favor. When it 
seems all lost, Piccolo asks Goku if he has a secret move. Goku says he has been 
settling down and hasn't trained as much. Piccolo calls him soft and wants to do 
the attack that he designed for Goku's execution to his own brother. </font> </span></p>

Piccolo asks Goku to go and fight his brother, while Piccolo powers up for his 
ultimate attack. After both brothers have fought enough for Goku to fall to the 
ground, Piccolo is ready to attack. Goku tells him to go, so, Piccolo does. 
After about 3 seconds, the attack is done, and, smoke is everywhere. Piccolo 
looks to see the Radditz is still standing, after performing a very strong 
attack. Radditz tells him it was all in vain and you will lose. </font> </span></p>

<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Goku is on the ground, being kicked to death. Piccolo is just watching in 
horror, knowing that if he tries his attack again, he will dodge. Gohan is 
getting seriously pissed off, and, cannot take it anymore. Gohan breaks through 
his pod, and, goes straight for his uncle. After giving a very hard blow to the 
stomach, Radditz cannot move for a second. He then regains control, and, starts 
his attack on his nephew. Gohan gets kicked for about 20-30 feet away, causing 
Goku now to be angry. Radditz walks toward Gohan going to give the death blow, 
when, Goku gets up and grab his brother. Goku say he is stupid for letting his 
guard down. </font> </span></p>

<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Goku demands that Piccolo does that attack again, and, Piccolo starts before 
Goku could even tell him. Radditz then tries to give every excuse to not hold on 
to him. Goku closes his ears to him, and, Piccolo is done with powering up his 
attack. Radditz tells him to not do it; he will end his life, and never come 
back. Goku shuns him away, and, is ready to die. Piccolo begins to yell 
Makkankosappo, and, fires the screw beam. Radditz and Goku are both hit, and, it 
goes through them both. It ends very bloody, and, after talking a bit about how 
Goku will come back, Piccolo kills him with the final blow.</font></span>
