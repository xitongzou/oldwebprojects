        Freiza Saga</p>
      <p>38. Gohan vs. Krillen</p>
      <p>Telepathically sparring, Gohan and Krillen fight each other in their 
        minds, with Gohan being the eventual victor by cunningly using an energy 
        beam when Krillen didn't expect it.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>39. Ships People vs. Gohan, Krillen, and Bulma</p>
      <p>A ship disguised as a transparent bit of space sucked our heroes ship 
        in, and they held them captive. When the ship hits an asteroid field though, 
        Gohan and Krillen, and even Bulma assist them in saving everyone. They 
        are let go because of this.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>40. Gohan and Krillen vs. Fake Namekians</p>
      <p>Gohan and Krillen effortlessly defeat the two aliens posing as Nameks 
        to fool them, easily kicking their heads in.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>41. Two Henchmen vs. Krillen and Gohan</p>
      <p>The two guys from Earth easily win this fight, beating Frieza's henchmen 
        to a pulp, and effortlessly killing them.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>42. Vegeta vs. Cui</p>
      <p>After following Vegeta to Namek, Cui challenged him expecting to be far 
        stronger. Without much trouble, Vegeta killed his former friend, in one 
        swift blast.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>43. Zarbon vs. Nameks</p>
      <p>After sensing Vegeta's power, Frieza isn't at all worried, and continues 
        getting Dragonballs of the Nameks. He gets Zarbon to kill all the resistance, 
        then takes the 'ball from the Namek elder, as if he's taking candy from 
        a baby.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>44. Henchmen vs. Nameks</p>
      <p>Some more Nameks come, and attack Frieza's henchmen in an effort to save 
        the villagers. They succeed, until Frieza orders Dodoria to step in, and 
        kill these pests. He does so without any strain at all.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>45. Gohan and Krillen vs. Dodoria</p>
      <p>After watching Dodoria bully some Namekian kids, Gohan and Krillen couldn't 
        take it anymore, charging in, and attacking the alien who is far stronger 
        than them. They knocked him through a building, grabbed the remaining 
        kid, and flew off, with Dodoria in hot pursuit. They managed to lose him 
        by hiding though, and narrowly avoiding one of his blasts. Dodoria flew 
        off thinking that he had killed the meddlers.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>46. Dodoria vs. Vegeta</p>
      <p>On his way back, Dodoria met up with Vegeta, and warned him to just walk 
        away. Vegeta could tell by the way that his enemy was talking that he 
        knew h was stronger than him. Dodoria tries to fight the Saiyan off, but 
        isn't anywhere near strong enough, eventually submitting to him, and giving 
        away valuable information about the destruction of the Saiyan home planet, 
        saying Frieza was the one who destroyed it. Vegeta said Dodoria could 
        go, but sent an energy beam at him as he flew off, killing him outright, 
        and disposing of another one of Frieza's henchmen.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>47. Zarbon vs. Vegeta</p>
      <p>After finding out about Vegeta's plans and his power, Frieza sent Zarbon 
        to dispose of him, with the henchman locating Vegeta, and fighting with 
        him. Vegeta easily defeated Zarbon, until he did something that completely 
        changed the outcome of the match. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>48. Vegeta vs. Transformed Zarbon</p>
      <p>Zarbon transformed, and with his increased power, he effortlessly defeated 
        Vegeta, blasting him into a lake.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>49. Vegeta vs. Henchman</p>
      <p>Whilst Vegeta was in the regeneration tank, one of Frieza's henchmen 
        was making fun of him, causing him to lose his temper, and send a blast 
        out of the tank, killing the soldier straight away. He then escaped from 
        Frieza's ship, grabbing Frieza's Dragonballs on the way.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>50. Vegeta vs. Transformed Zarbon</p>
      <p>After being sent by Frieza to find Vegeta and retrieve the Dragonballs, 
        Zarbon located the Saiyan when he was confronting Krillen, and demanding 
        he hand over his 'ball. Zarbon thought they were friends, and threatened 
        to kill them both, but Vegeta easily defeated him, with a devastating 
        punch to the gut, then an energy beam, blasting him into a lake.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>51. Krillen and Gohan vs. Guldo</p>
      <p>This was quite a good fight, where Guldo was constantly freezing time 
        in an attempt to tip the scales in his favor, but he was unsuccessful 
        until he managed to put Gohan and Krillen into some sort of suspended 
        animation, where they couldn't move a muscle. He then raised a tree out 
        of the ground, and made the tip sharp with use of telekinesis, and threw 
        it towards the two people from Earth, with use of the same skill. Neither 
        of them could move, until Vegeta stepped in.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>52. Vegeta vs. Guldo</p>
      <p>Vegeta shot a KI blast at Guldo, and made him release the psychic grip 
        he had on the two Earthlings, allowing them to avoid the dagger-like trees. 
        Guldo fell to the floor. Vegeta then held out his hand, and unleashed 
        a devastating big bang on the frog-like creature, killing him immediately.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>53. Vegeta vs. Racoome</p>
      <p>This was an awesome fight, with Vegeta gaining an early advantage, but 
        Racoome proving his toughness managed to eventually win, and was ready 
        to kill Vegeta, when Krillen and Gohan stepped in.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>54. Krillen vs. Racoome</p>
      <p>Krillen kicked Racoome in the back, just as he used the attack, and knocked 
        him down to the floor, whilst Gohan grabbed Vegeta out of the way. Racoome 
        then got up, and with one swift kick, he hit Krillen in the face, almost 
        knocking his head clean off. Unable to move, the bald midget could only 
        watch from the floor as the next parts of the battle unfolded before his 
        eyes.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>55. Gohan vs. Racoome</p>
      <p>Gohan fought valiantly, but just didn't have the strength to win in the 
        end, with Racoome beating him to a pulp, despite the kids best efforts 
        to inflict pain towards the big bully. Gohan was hit onto the floor, unable 
        to get up, and extremely close to death. Goku had landed on the planet 
        Namek though, and help would soon be at hand.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>56. Goku vs. Racoome</p>
      <p>Goku zipped onto the scene, showing his immense speed by making Racoome 
        confused and dizzy just by flying past him. He fed Gohan, Krillen, and 
        Vegeta a sensu bean, then got to work in fighting Racoome. The big guy 
        charged up, but was quickly disposed of as Goku hit him in the stomach 
        with an elbow, with his speed undetectable to anyone.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>57. Goku vs. Jeice and Burta</p>
      <p>Goku toyed with these two for a while, showing off his superior speed, 
        before hammering onto them, knocking Burta unconscious, and threatening 
        Jeice to either leave or die. Knowing that fighting Goku would be useless, 
        Jeice flew away to get back up. Vegeta moaned at Goku for letting him 
        escape.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>58. Vegeta vs. Racoome and Burta</p>
      <p>With the two on the floor, Vegeta quickly pounced and finished them off, 
        not allowing the evil doers a chance at living. Goku wasn't happy with 
        this, but Vegeta had his reasons, knowing how much suffering that they 
        had caused in the past. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>59. Nameks vs. Frieza</p>
      <p>Frieza was at Guru's causing trouble, when some Nameks flew in, and attacked 
        the evil tyrant. They were easily disposed of though, leaving only Nail 
        to protect the eldest Namek. He proposed they fight away from Guru though, 
        and Frieza reluctantly agreed.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>60. Goku vs. Ginyu</p>
      <p>This seemed to be a very close fight until Ginyu told Goku that he knew 
        he wasn't even trying. Goku then upped the pace, and even with interferences 
        from Jeice, he still had a firm advantage on the fight. Ginyu then asked 
        Goku to power up to his maximum, which turned out to be about 60,000 more 
        than the captains is. In disbelief, Ginyu went mad, crashing to the floor, 
        and soaring through the lake before regaining his composure, and coming 
        up with a clever ploy. He used his body change attack after hitting himself 
        hard in the chest. Goku was now in Ginyu's damaged body, and Ginyu was 
        in Goku's light, powerful, unharmed body. Jeice and Ginyu flew off leaving 
        Goku for dead.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>61. Nail vs. Frieza</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Nail was fighting Frieza, in an attempt to hold him up sufficiently. 
        Frieza destroyed Nail, and was about to finish him off when the Namek 
        told the evil tyrant his aim, which was achieved, making Frieza leave 
        the injured Nail to die, flying off to find the Earthlings after 'his' 
        Dragonballs.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>62. Ginyu (In Goku's Body) vs. Krillen and Gohan</p>
      <p>Ginyu tricked Gohan and Krillen into believing that he was Goku, until 
        the Saiyan himself turned up (In Ginyu's body). He told Krillen and Gohan 
        to fight Ginyu (In Goku's body), as he wouldn't be able to get to maximum 
        power. It turned out he was right, as the two Earth people gained a heavy 
        vantage against the captain. Eventually though, Ginyu figured out how 
        his new body worked, and managed to tip the tables in his favor. He fired 
        a blast at Gohan which the kid could never avoid, but it was hammered 
        away by the injured Goku (In Ginyu's Body) as he announced that he has 
        worked out how his new body worked too.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>63. Vegeta vs. Jeice</p>
      <p>Vegeta was lurking in the shadows upon Ginyu's arrival, and decided to 
        fight Jeice when he tried to assist the captain. The fight went all through 
        Frieza's ship, and eventually finished outside, where Vegeta proved his 
        superiority, and killed the orange guy with a big bang attack, but not 
        before announcing himself to be a Super Saiyan (He wasn't though).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>64. Goku (In Ginyu's Body), Krillen, and Gohan vs. Ginyu (In Goku's Body)</p>
      <p>Goku (In Ginyu's body) prepared to fight with Ginyu (In Goku's body), 
        with Krillen and Gohan alongside him to help, but he was too injured to 
        do any real damage, with the fight just consisting of Ginyu blocking all 
        the time, until Vegeta arrived on the scene, cocky after his victory against 
        Jeice.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>65. Vegeta vs. Ginyu (In Goku's Body)</p>
      <p>Vegeta stepped in, and easily destroyed Ginyu, beating him around the 
        floor, before slamming him hard to the ground. He then dived down to finish 
        him off, when Ginyu decided it was time to change bodies again. He attempted 
        the attack, but Goku had predicted it, and intercepted its path, getting 
        his old body back. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>66. Goku vs. Ginyu</p>
      <p>With both men back in their own respective body, they squared off against 
        each other. Goku stood tall, and charged up a KameHameHa. Ginyu was too 
        hurt to dodge it, after the punch he gave himself earlier was still hurting 
        him badly. Goku shot the beam away, but his aim was slightly off, as he 
        hadn't yet properly adapted to his body again. He fell to the floor, leaving 
        Ginyu to fight Vegeta.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>67. Ginyu vs. Vegeta</p>
      <p>Vegeta roughed Ginyu up badly, to the point where he could hardly move, 
        with hardly any effort. After failing to change bodies with Vegeta once, 
        Ginyu tried it again, with no Goku to foil him this time. Vegeta interpreted 
        it though, and dodged the attack, causing more pain to Ginyu instead. 
        He was ready to finish him off, knocking him to the floor, and charging 
        in, almost an exact replica as the position he had him in before, when 
        he was in Goku's body. Ginyu prepared the attack, and yelled &quot;Change 
        now!&quot; signaling his body swapping attack. Vegeta had no idea what 
        was coming, and was unable to move out of the way.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>68. Goku vs. Ginyu</p>
      <p>As Ginyu was about to attack Vegeta with the body change attack, a frog 
        hopped into Goku's hand, giving him an idea. Goku threw the amphibian 
        into the path of the attack, making Ginyu change into a frog, and finishing 
        him off once and for all. Goku was helped into Frieza's ship, where Vegeta 
        put him into a regeneration tank to heal, ready to fight Frieza.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>69. Vegeta vs. Frieza</p>
      <p>After attacking pretty much everyone, Frieza decided to focus on Vegeta. 
        He charged towards him, and threw two punches, both of which were caught 
        by the Saiyan. The sheer power of the two made a huge crater in the ground, 
        underneath their feet. After a short struggle, the two jumped back, with 
        Vegeta completely out of breath, and Frieza having not even broke a sweat.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>70. 2nd Form Frieza vs. Krillen</p>
      <p>After transforming, Frieza decided to check out who to kill first. He 
        charged at Krillen who was holding Dende, with his horns leading the way. 
        In a noble move, Krillen threw Dende out of the way of Frieza's flight 
        path, but because of this, he didn't have time to evade the attack himself, 
        thus getting stabbed in the stomach by Frieza's horns. They went right 
        through him, cutting off his breathing passages. After a while, Frieza 
        threw him into the water. Gohan flew after his friend to try and save 
        him, but Frieza blocked him ruthlessly.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>71. Gohan vs. 2nd Form Frieza</p>
      <p>Gohan couldn't take it anymore, and burst out with one of his anger spurts, 
        beating Frieza up with a multitude of kicks and punches to the face and 
        gut, followed through with an energy beam in the face, which knocked Frieza 
        all the way down to the ground. He then continued the relentless assault 
        with KI blasts, almost machine gun-like in speed, causing a huge cloud, 
        which got bigger with every blast. Gohan finishes it off with an absolutely 
        gigantic masenko. It looked like it was all over, but the smoke and dust 
        cleared, and Frieza got up. He wasn't very happy either. Gohan was too 
        scared to move, and the &quot;mighty midget&quot; was easily disposed 
        of, getting slammed down to the ground. Just as Frieza was about to finish 
        Gohan off, Krillen came back, as healthy as ever! Dende had healed him.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>72. Krillen vs. 2nd Form Frieza</p>
      <p>Taking him by surprise, Krillen threw some destructo discs at Frieza, 
        with the evil tyrant dodging all but one, which resulted in his tail getting 
        cut off. He chased Krillen around for a while, but the bald midget kept 
        on escaping, with cunning moves. He finally escaped with a solar flare, 
        leaving Frieza covering his eyes. Krillen flew away, and went right past 
        Vegeta, stopping to see what he was staring at. Gohan was getting healed. 
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>73. Gohan, Vegeta, and Krillen vs. 2nd Form Frieza</p>
      <p>This fight never actually happened. Gohan was healed, and he floated 
        up to join his two team mates, with them all charging at Frieza, but before 
        they could even throw a punch, Piccolo stood in the way, after finally 
        arriving, having already fused with Nail. It was the fight that could 
        have been great, but in the end wasn't anything.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>74. Piccolo vs. 2nd Form Frieza</p>
      <p>This fight went back and forth, with Frieza having an overall advantage. 
        Whatever happened though, Piccolo kept on getting back up, and fighting 
        on. When Piccolo takes off his weighted clothes though, the whole concept 
        of the fight changed. He charged up, and then let off a huge ball of energy, 
        sending Frieza flying backwards in agony and awe. When he regains his 
        composure, and has shaken off the beating, Frieza went back over to Piccolo, 
        and, knowing that he couldn't win with his current power, decided to transform 
        again.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>75. Piccolo vs. 3rd Form Frieza</p>
      <p>Frieza transformed, and looked like a huge, ugly, mutated duck. Piccolo 
        couldn't believe his power level, but still tried to fight him none-the-less. 
        It was immediately clear that any chances of winning had gone directly 
        out of the window. Frieza dominated the fight, and began to slowly destroy 
        Piccolo with one finger beams, laughing as he hit the Namek in every place 
        on his body, causing mass bleeding. Gohan couldn't take any more, and 
        charged in to save his best friend.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>76. 3rd Form Frieza vs. Gohan</p>
      <p>Gohan charged into Frieza, and nailed him, sending him sprawling downwards 
        to the ground, taking him by surprise. He then sends the biggest masenko 
        that he could have ever hoped to conjure up, directly at the falling Frieza. 
        The evil one desperately blocks the blast, but it is too strong for him 
        to maintain it, and he is slowly driven downwards to the ground in absolutely 
        agony, screaming out in pain. Eventually, Frieza managed to bounce it 
        away, with a huge vein having been formed on his forehead from all the 
        stress he was under during the attack. He decides that he has no choice 
        other than to transform into his final form if he is to win.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>77. Ginyu the Frog vs. Bulma</p>
      <p>Bulma develops a universal translator, and puts it on Ginyu the frog 
        so he can speak English. Consequentially, he uses his body change attack, 
        and switches into Bulma's body, leaving her as a frog. He then goes off 
        to find Frieza, in Bulma's body.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>78. Krillen vs. Vegeta</p>
      <p>After seeing the healing capabilities of Dende, Vegeta demands that Krillen 
        blasts him. His plan is that the Namek will heal him, and due to his Saiyan 
        cells, he will be even stronger than before, and able to take on Frieza. 
        After getting annoyed at Krillen's pitiful efforts, Vegeta moves in to 
        attack, but has an energy beam ripped right through his stomach. He rapidly 
        descends towards the ground, gasping for breath, but smiling that the 
        midget managed to do it. Hopefully, he will soon be stronger than Frieza.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>79. Final Form Frieza vs. Dende</p>
      <p>After achieving his strongest form, Frieza holds his finger out, and 
        shoots a beam at the most troublesome member of his opponents - Dende. 
        He has seen the Nameks healing powers, and wants to kill him before he 
        can help anyone else. The beam rips right through the youth, killing him 
        immediately. Frieza the turns to everyone else, and prepares to decide 
        who to kill next.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>80. Final Form Frieza vs. Gohan</p>
      <p>Holding out his finger once more, Frieza fires a blast at the person 
        who's been doing him the most damage - Gohan. Due to the speed of the 
        attack, Gohan doesn't even see it coming, and can't so much as mount a 
        defense. Luckily for him though, Vegeta's new found speed and powers allowed 
        him to track the attack perfectly, and hit Gohan in the back of the head, 
        diverting him to safety. He then boasts how powerful he is to Frieza.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>81. Final Form Frieza vs. Vegeta</p>
      <p>After powering up, Vegeta charged at Frieza, and for a while, it looked 
        as though he had the advantage. After a short bit of dodging punches, 
        Frieza decided to end it, and beat Vegeta to a pulp, showing his incredible 
        speed and strength. He then picked the Saiyan up by the neck, and began 
        pummeling him. Goku arrived on the scene, and demanded that his fellow 
        Saiyan be dropped. Frieza abides by this, after delivering one final punch. 
        Vegeta still isn't dead though, so Frieza shoots a beam right through 
        him. But the Saiyan prince shows great resilience, in trying to tell Goku 
        about Frieza's evil ways in his last gasps of breath. Growing tired of 
        the Saiyans ramblings, Frieza sends another blast right through his chest, 
        killing him properly this time.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>82. Goku vs. Final Form Frieza</p>
      <p>This fight lasts a while, with Frieza showing his obvious superiority 
        in terms of power. Goku had his moments during the fight though, such 
        as when he used his kai-o-ken times 20, and gained a short, almost insignificant 
        advantage against the evil one. Goku had taken a massive beating, and 
        Frieza had been roughed up a little bit too. Knowing that Goku's strength 
        was far greater than he had estimated, Frieza decides that he has to power 
        up a little more to win.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>83. Ginyu (In Bulma's Body) vs. Krillen, Piccolo, and Gohan</p>
      <p>Ginyu arrives at the battle field, and accidentally gives his true identity 
        away, attacking Krillen. He can't hurt him in such a weak body though, 
        so he turns to Piccolo, as he is the strongest person there. The Namek 
        is unaware of Ginyu's dangerous abilities, and is almost caught in the 
        body change attack, and would have been had Gohan not have intercepted 
        by throwing Bulma the frog in the way, changing the two back to normal. 
        Ginyu the frog then hopped off away from the battle, and Bulma was confused 
        as to what just happened.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>84. 50% Frieza vs. Goku</p>
      <p>Frieza powers up to 50% of his maximum, and resumes beating the snot 
        out of Goku for a while. Goku uses his speed and strength to block energy 
        beams, and avoid explosions, but Frieza is always too fast for him to 
        do anything in terms of offense. Suddenly, Goku is enlightened, and knows 
        what he must do. He raises his arms in the air, and begins to charge up 
        a galaxy spirit bomb. There isn't enough energy left on Namek, which is 
        why he reaches out to the stars and other planets. Frieza waits for Goku 
        to attack for a while, but soon grows impatient, and beats the hell out 
        of Goku. Seeing this, Piccolo knows that they must intervene, otherwise 
        it is other for Goku. Instead though, they decide to offer the Saiyan 
        their energy, in the hope that he can gather it for his spirit bomb. He 
        keeps on powering up the attack, until he is knocked onto the floor near 
        a lake. Frieza sees the energy balls reflection, and works out what Goku 
        was doing. He holds out the palm of his hand, and prepares to kill the 
        Saiyan so that the energy ball will just fall to pieces.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>85. 50% Frieza vs. Piccolo, Gohan, and Krillen</p>
      <p>Just before Frieza can blast Goku, Piccolo enters the scene, and kicks 
        the evil one hard across the face, sending him flying. The Namek knows 
        that he can't win, so tells Goku to hurry up with the charging up of his 
        spirit bomb. Frieza gets up, and is irate. He roughs Piccolo up badly, 
        and notices the shadow of the spirit bomb before he finishes him off. 
        Quickly, he goes over to where Goku stands, but he is sandwiched by two 
        high velocity attacks. Gohan and Krillen stand either side of him, after 
        using the masenko and KameHameHa respectively. Frieza is mad, and forgets 
        all about stopping the spirit bomb. Goku senses something, and realizes 
        it is ready. Everyone notices this, and tries to get out of the way.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>86. 50% Frieza vs. Goku and Piccolo</p>
      <p>Goku throws the spirit bomb down at Frieza, and it knocks the tyrant 
        backwards, as he is unable to block it. He is pushed down against the 
        ground, before eventually being vanquished. There is a huge explosion, 
        and a hole is made in the planet, where water gushes in. Everyone seems 
        to be alright, but Goku is hurt badly. Frieza seems to be no where in 
        sight. Is he dead? Far from it. He stands on a rock, his finger outstretched, 
        and aimed at Goku. He shoots the beam, but Piccolo dives in the way, and 
        takes the attack for his friend. He is hurt badly, but manages to cling 
        onto his life. Frieza is a bit annoyed at Goku surviving, so he decides 
        to leave him to last.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>87. 50% Frieza vs. Krillen</p>
      <p>Frieza turns to Krillen, and sends some sort of beam towards him, which 
        gives him ultimate control over the midgets body. It comes at Krillen 
        too quick for him to dodge it, and Frieza laughs manically as he raises 
        the cueball into the air. Goku pleads with the evil one to stop, but Frieza 
        merely laughs more, and makes Krillen explode, finally killing the human 
        pest. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>88. SSJ Goku vs. 50% Frieza</p>
      <p>Angry at his friends death, Goku manages to complete the famous SSJ transformation. 
        He easily beats up Frieza, having a distinct advantage at all times, only 
        being hurt on occasions. Frieza looks defeated, cowering constantly, and 
        pleading with Goku to stop. Resorting to desperate measures, he throws 
        an energy ball down at the planets core, but finds out that he held too 
        much back, and its explosion will be a delayed reaction, approximately 
        5 minutes. He fights his hardest, but he just doesn't have the power to 
        win. He decides on blasting Goku backwards, and gathering energy to transform 
        into 100%. Goku soon gets back though, but is curious to see how strong 
        the tyrant is, allowing him to go up to full power.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>89. SSJ Goku vs. 100% Frieza</p>
      <p>Frieza is now at his most powerful possible state - 4th Form, powered 
        up to full. He fights Goku with is going back and forth, neither man having 
        any real advantage over the other. It is a good fight, and exchange of 
        punches, as the muscular Frieza battles with pure anger in his heart, 
        as does Super Saiyan Goku. Eventually, Frieza hits Goku into a volcano, 
        not allowing him any time to get back up. Thinking Goku is dead, Frieza 
        powers down to 50% again.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>90. Gohan vs. 50% Frieza</p>
      <p>Gohan returns to be told that his dad is dead, and he cried and pleaded 
        for his life before being killed by Frieza. Of course this is all a lie, 
        and does nothing but enrages Gohan, making him pummel Frieza to the ground. 
        Remembering the kids power, Frieza got back up to his feet, and this time 
        was ready for the attacks, easily hurting the kid, and beating him down 
        to the floor. Frieza works out that Gohan is just trying to buy some time, 
        so that the planet explodes on him, and is ready to kill him once and 
        for all.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>91. SSJ Goku vs. 100% Frieza</p>
      <p>Before Frieza can finish Gohan off, Goku burst forth out of the volcano 
        he was knocked into, and supposedly died in, scaring Frieza, and making 
        the evil one hastily power back up to 100%. Goku shouts at his son to 
        leave, and the two massive powers go at it again. They are even at first, 
        but Goku's stamina and strength eventually proves too much for Frieza, 
        with him easily beating the evil fiend up. When he goes to leave, saying 
        it is over, Frieza throws a cutting disc at Goku, which homes in. Irate, 
        Goku flies around, easily dodging them, and eventually making them cut 
        Frieza, their creator, in half. Feeling pity for the two-piece tyrant, 
        Goku gave him some energy, then walked off. Frieza used this energy to 
        blast Goku, but the Super Saiyan managed to counter it with one of his 
        own, which was more powerful, supposedly killing Frieza. He then flew 
        off, leaving the evil one to die.</p>
