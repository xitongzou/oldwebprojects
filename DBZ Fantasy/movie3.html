 <h3><strong><font face="Arial" color="#2F69A8">Ultimate Decisive
 Battle for Earth</font></strong></h3>
 <font size="2">
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A probe-like machine flies to the
 Earth. Without thought, it starts a forest fire. Gohan and Krillin put
 out the fire and save a purple dragon. The forest is gone so they
 gather the Dragonballs and Gohan wishes the forest back. The next day
 the machine scans the planet and reports back to a group of pirates.
 They talk for a little while and decide to plant the Tree of Might on
 the earth to drain all of its life energy. It quickly destroys a lot.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Gohan and Goku are at home relaxing.
 The purple dragon that Gohan saved follows him around. Chi-chi
 dislikes it, but Gohan keeps the dragon. Yamcha has bought in a new
 flying car and wants to impress Bulma with it. While flying the car is
 destroyed and Yamcha is left there.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The tree destroys cities and many miles
 of Earth. Goku, Krillin, Yamcha, Tienshinhan, and Chaozu all head to
 the roots of the tree. Chi-chi made Gohan stay home. They all try to
 blast the tree, but it's no good. The space pirates show up and start
 battling the Z fighters. Gohan sneaks out and finds the leader of the
 pirates who looks a lot like Goku. Taurus talks to Gohan and finds out
 he's a Saiya-jin. He then creates a fake moon like Vegeta did and
 turns Gohan Oozaru. Gohan goes crazy and starts attacking Goku. Gohan
 sees the purple dragon he saved and it gets his attention. Taurus then
 attacks Gohan so Goku cuts Gohan's tail off. The Z fighters are
 defeated so Taurus's henchmen attack Goku, but he kills them all.
 Taurus then attack Goku and they seem pretty close in power.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Taurus eats a piece of the fruit from
 the tree making him a lot stronger than Goku even when he does
 Kaio-ken x10. Goku makes a spirit bomb to try to defeat Taurus. Taurus
 sees the ball coming at him and deflects it. Taurus was able to
 deflect it since the Earth didn't have much power to give the bomb.
 Goku attempts another bomb, but this time he takes energy from the
 tree instead of the earth. He fires the bomb at Taurus and hits.
 Taurus is killed along with the Tree of Might and all the energy is
 give back to the earth. All is peaceful again on the earth.</font></p>
