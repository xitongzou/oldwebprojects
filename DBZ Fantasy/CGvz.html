<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Vegeta - “Bejiita”</b> The Prince of the
Saiyajin race, he is the son of King Vegeta and one of the only Saiyajin to
survive the destruction of the planet Vegeta.&nbsp; He has peculiar hair that
grows almost straight up and a large widow’s peak.&nbsp; Vegeta’s most
recognizable feature is almost certainly his hair, because it is so different
from any other character in the series and makes him easy to identify.&nbsp;
Vegeta’s attitude is generally one of great confidence.&nbsp; He is somewhat
cocky, very proud and self-righteous.&nbsp; He has a mocking, crooked,
left-sided smirk, which he uses quite often in the Saiyan and Frieza Sagas.&nbsp;
Another peculiar thing about Vegeta is that he never once calls Goku by his
Earth-given name, but only his Saiyajin name – Kakarotto (Kakarot).&nbsp; At
first Goku dislikes this, but he grows used to it as time passes and he learns
more about Vegeta’s reasoning.&nbsp; For most of the series, Vegeta is bent on
becoming stronger than Goku.&nbsp; He becomes obsessed with the idea of one day
defeating Kakarotto in battle, and this remains his one desire for a very long
while.&nbsp; Vegeta was born in 732 AD, and from the start, all knew he was
destined for greatness.&nbsp; As a child, his power level exceeded that of even
his father’s. After planet Vegeta is destroyed, Vegeta works under Frieza
wiping planets of life and destroying rebellious armies.&nbsp; Vegeta starts out
as a major villain of DBZ, as he comes to Earth seeking possession of the
dragonballs.&nbsp; He battles Goku for several episodes in the Saiyan Saga, but
despite the close calls, the fight ends in a tie and the two Saiyajin separate
to recover.&nbsp; Vegeta heads for planet Namek to collect the Namek Dragonballs,
only to find that Frieza has already obtained most of them.&nbsp; He temporarily
allies himself with Krillin and Gohan when the group comes up against the Ginyu
Force.&nbsp; Goku surprises everyone by giving the Saiyajin prince a senzu bean,
but even more surprising are Vegeta’s actions during the Frieza Saga.&nbsp; He
saves Gohan’s life a total of 4 times, and Krillin’s life twice.&nbsp; He
helps Goku by giving him access to the rejuvenation tank in Frieza’s ship.&nbsp;
Vegeta nearly achieves Super Saiyajin while fighting Frieza, but never quite
reaches it.&nbsp; Frieza beats him to a bloody pulp until Goku arrives, but
Frieza fires one last fatal shot at Vegeta, killing him. As he is dying, Vegeta
reveals the secrets of his past and what Frieza has done to his family, the
royal line, and the Saiyajin race.&nbsp; Because of this speech, Goku changes
and becomes extremely angry with Frieza.&nbsp; A few episodes later, Vegeta
appears to Goku in a vision…naked…(he wears pants in the dub, unfortunately
for the lady fans) and retells the tragic tale of the Saiyajin race and their
great loss all because of Frieza.&nbsp; This speech inspires Goku to take
revenge on Frieza for all the pain and suffering he has caused.&nbsp; Vegeta is
revived with the Earth Dragonballs, and just before he is transported to Earth
with a wish from the Namek Dragonballs, he manages to find Goku and Frieza.&nbsp;
He commends Goku on his transformation as a Super Saiyajin and causes Frieza to
totally freak out when he sees Vegeta, as Frieza knows full well that he had
killed the Saiyajin prince several hours before.&nbsp; Vegeta comes to accept
his situation on Earth and lives at Capsule Corporation for the time being while
waiting for Goku to come back.&nbsp; It is at this point he becomes more
acquainted with Bulma and her family.&nbsp; About this time, it has become clear
to most that Vegeta is more a neutral ally to the general cause. When Goku does
not return, Vegeta angrily takes a Capsule Corp. ship and leaves Earth to search
for him.&nbsp; He returns in time for the Trunks Saga, and a few years later
leaves again to train out in space alone, where he eventually turns Super
Saiyajin in a rage during a heavy meteor shower on a small planet which could
have killed him at any time.&nbsp; His total frustration that two Super
Saiyajins can exist where it was previously thought that there was only one
legendary Super Saiyajin throws Vegeta into a rage and he trains furiously at
the thought that he is a failure to his father and the Saiyajin race because of
his weakness.&nbsp; During these three years of peace, Vegeta and Bulma have a
son named Trunks.&nbsp; Vegeta trains alone with Future Trunks for a year inside
the Room of Spirit and Time, where both reach Ultimate Super Saiyajin.&nbsp;
Vegeta is full of pride and expects a lot of his son, and does not seem to care
very much about him.&nbsp; However, when Cell kills Trunks near the end of the
Cell Saga, Vegeta loses all control and flies at Cell, attacking him with a
furious barrage of punches and kicks with such energy as he never had before.&nbsp;
While Gohan and Cell are wrestling with the two biggest Kamehamehas ever formed
in a final bout of power, Vegeta tactfully positions himself behind Cell and
fires a Final Flash at his back, surprising Cell and causing him to lose his
concentration so that Gohan’s Kamehameha overwhelms him and literally destroys
Cell down to every last particle.&nbsp; Vegeta and Bulma do in fact get married,
apparently sometime between the Cell Saga and the Buu Saga, and although it is
never shown nor the exact date revealed, the event is mentioned in the Japanese
version later in the series.&nbsp; Vegeta is tough on his son, but he really
cares about him and Bulma.&nbsp; In the Buu Saga, Vegeta appears to have calmed
down some, but in reality he only looks that way because Goku has been away
training in the Afterlife for about 7 years.&nbsp; When Goku returns, tempers
flare, and Vegeta’s jealous anger rises so high that Darbura senses this
weakness and instructs Babidi to possess Vegeta and take over his mind, which he
does, causing Vegeta to go Majin, an evil form of a person with their mind
usually possessed by Babidi and their power level increased greatly.&nbsp;
Vegeta reaches Super Saiyajin 2 in this form and resists most of Babidi’s
attempts to control his mind, although he does allow the evil to control his
actions.&nbsp; To get Goku to fight him, he blows up an entire section of the
stadium at the 25th Tenkaichi Budoukai (conveniently cleared of people in the
dub).&nbsp; Although battle between Goku and Vegeta appears to be another tie,
Vegeta is probably slightly stronger, and while Goku is distracted, Vegeta
knocks him out and puts off their fight to face Buu.&nbsp; While Vegeta appears
to have returned to his evil ways, he is really not so hardened deep down.&nbsp;
Vegeta proves this when he meets Buu for the first time, and immediately vows to
avenge Gohan’s “death” at Buu’s hands (although he is actually quite
alive, his power level drops so low that he is assumed dead).&nbsp; He fights
with Buu for a while, only to find that he is overpowered at every turn. Knowing
full well that Buu is capable of killing his son, his wife, and everyone he
cares about, he makes the grim but courageous decision to act as a kamikaze
force in attempt to destroy Buu once and for all.&nbsp; Piccolo informs Vegeta
that despite the manner of his death and any of his recent accomplishments in
life, the millions and perhaps billions of deaths he caused in his youth during
his planet-clearing days working for Frieza would override everything, and he
would almost certainly go to Hell.&nbsp; Even with this knowledge, Vegeta makes
up his mind to do whatever it takes to save his family and those he cares for.&nbsp;
Trunks tries to stop him, and Vegeta hugs him one last time before he knocks him
out and uses Ultimate Final Skill to explode all of his life energy into one
great bomb, making the ultimate sacrifice for Earth.&nbsp; Despite his attempts,
Buu survives, and Vegeta apparently (according to Piccolo) goes to Hell.&nbsp;
He returns later in the Buu Saga with the aid of Baba and special permission
granted from King Yama to help Goku save Earth.&nbsp; Vegeta makes the difficult
decision to fuse permanently with Goku into Vegetto to defeat Buu (though they
defuse a bit later anyway due to special circumstances).&nbsp; At this point
Vegeta is finally coming to terms with the fact that Goku is indeed more
powerful than he, and during the fight between Super Saiyajin 3 Goku and Buu,
Vegeta admits that Goku is the strongest Saiyajin in the universe.&nbsp; He is
resurrected by the Namek II Dragonballs along with everyone else destroyed by
Buu, including the entire population of Earth.&nbsp; Vegeta even tries to talk
the people of Earth into giving up their energy for Goku’s Genki Dama, but Mr.
Satan proves to be much better at it, due to his supreme popularity.&nbsp; After
the Buu Saga, Vegeta and Bulma have another child, this time a daughter named
Bra.&nbsp; He becomes quite fond of his daughter and is extremely protective of
her.&nbsp; Bitter enemies from the very beginning of DBZ, Goku and Vegeta prove
to be practically best friends by the end of the series.&nbsp; In GT, Vegeta
cuts his trademark hair to make it short and all one length.&nbsp; He even grows
a mustache, although most agree that it is hideous, and should all be very
relieved that it only lasts for one episode before he shaves it off.&nbsp;
Because Goku is trapped in a child’s body, Vegeta is actually generally
stronger than Goku for most of GT, but Vegeta elects to stay on Earth with his
family and guard the planet.&nbsp; Goku and Vegeta are finally, truly equal in
power once they both reach Super Saiyajin level 4, and during GT there is an
entire episode completely devoted to Vegeta, an honor that no other character in
the series is lucky enough to receive.&nbsp; At the very end of GT, Vegeta is
one of the only characters that actually know where Goku is going and what he
will do there.&nbsp; Although it is never made obvious, Vegeta eventually
becomes and remains one of Goku’s closest friends.</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Vegetto - “Bejiitto”</b> Considered the
single most powerful character in DBZ, Vegetto is the result of the fusion of
Goku and Vegeta.&nbsp; Vegetto appears only in the late Buu Saga.&nbsp; Goku and
Vegeta must put on the Potara earrings given them by Revered Kaioshin in order
to become a warrior many times more powerful than either Saiyajin alone. Vegetto
is a totally different person, and so his personality is completely different
than either of the two Saiyajin who fuse to become him.&nbsp; A Saiyajin of
magnificent power, Vegetto appears to handle Buu with great ease after going
Super Saiyajin 2.&nbsp; However, Vegetto, like all fusions, is extremely cocky,
and merely plays with Buu rather than getting to the point and destroying him.&nbsp;
In the manga, Vegetto is only in the storyline for a very short period, but in
the anime he lasts for quite a few episodes.&nbsp; Unlike most fusions during
this saga, Vegetto does not have a set time limit in his fused state, but rather
is a permanent fusion.&nbsp; At one point Buu manages to turn Vegetto into a
piece of coffee candy, but the Saiyajin maintains his power level even in such a
form. His speed in so small a form is incredible, and the coffee candy Vegetto
beats the crap out of Buu until he finally changes Vegetto back into his
original form.&nbsp; However, Vegetto continues to waste time toying with Buu
until he manages to absorb the fused Saiyajin.&nbsp; Although the fusion is
supposed to be permanent, Buu’s magical enzymes cause Vegetto to break down
into his components in order for Buu to gain power from him, and thus Vegetto
defuses back into Goku and Vegeta.&nbsp; Once they are separated, the satisfied
Vegeta removes his earring and crushes it in his fist, to which Goku at first
objects, but later agrees and does the same.&nbsp; They both vow never again to
fuse in such a manner.</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Videl - “Bideru”</b> Daughter of Mr.
Satan, Videl is perhaps the strongest female human.&nbsp; She was born in 756 AD
and for the most part grew up with only her father, as her mother died when she
was young.&nbsp; In her spare time Videl fights crime in Satan City. She becomes
suspicious of Gohan after meeting him at Orange Star High School, and she even
follows him for a brief time to learn more about him.&nbsp; Videl eventually
discovers Gohan’s secret identity as the Great Saiyaman when she catches him
changing out of his costume, and using a blackmail-type of threat she gets him
to teach her how to fly.&nbsp; In a matter of days, she learns how to fly, and
develops a liking for Gohan.&nbsp; She even cuts her hair because he had told
her the day before that long hair will only get in the way during a fight.
Despite the relentless teasing from friends, Videl and Gohan develop a sweet
kind of relationship.&nbsp; Videl becomes very strong for a human, and enters
the 25th Tenkaichi Budoukai, only to be beaten nearly to death by Spopovitch in
a slanted match.&nbsp; After the Buu Saga, Videl marries Gohan and has a
daughter named Pan.</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Yajirobe</b> A sword-wielding, somewhat short,
fat warrior monk.&nbsp; He first meets Goku in Dragonball during the Piccolo
Daimaou Saga, where he befriends the boy under a strange set of circumstances.&nbsp;
Cymbal, one of the spawn of Piccolo Daimaou, sneaks up on the two of them while
they are in the middle of a conversation. Because both are eager to fight the
creature, they play a game of rock-paper-scissors to determine who gets to
attack first.&nbsp; Yajirobe wins and promptly slices the creature in two, cooks
his limbs over a fire and eats him. Yajirobe comes to Goku’s rescue in the
Saiyan Saga when he bravely slices off Vegeta’s tail while he’s in Oozaru
(Great Monkey) form, causing him to transform back to his normal form.&nbsp;
However, after Vegeta is forced to escape the planet, Yajirobe goes straight to
the press with his outrageous story of “space fighters”, and takes all (or
most) of the credit.&nbsp; After a while, Yajirobe spends most of his time at
Korin’s Tower.&nbsp; Whether it is to train or simply eat his cooking is
uncertain, but he does manage to run errands for the cat-deity between snacks.&nbsp;
During the Garlic Junior Saga, they receive a visit from Maron, Krillin’s
girlfriend at the time, and the perfect example of a dumb blonde (if you
overlook the fact that her hair is green). Maron nearly drives Yajirobe and
Korin up the wall, as either is quite prepared to handle a helpless, sexy woman
in their household.&nbsp; (And who would be prepared?&nbsp; You don’t exactly
meet many women when your home is an impossibly high tower.)&nbsp; In the
Android Saga, Yajirobe finally meets his match – baby Trunks. Apparently,
Trunks doesn’t think too highly of the overweight warrior monk, and just about
every time Yajirobe holds him, baby Trunks manages to pee on him. Like many
early characters, Yajirobe loses a lot of importance later in the series.&nbsp;
By the end of DBZ, he grows a mustache and looks like a fat Mexican. Yajirobe is
5’4” tall, and doesn’t disclose his actual weight to anyone.</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Yamcha</b> - “Yamucha” Yamcha begins the
series as a teenage desert bandit.&nbsp; Along with his best friend Puar, he
robs wandering travelers in the desert and steals their Capsules.&nbsp; One of
his signature moves is Wolf’s Fang Fist, basically a swift super punch.&nbsp;
His little-known weakness is a terrible fear of women.&nbsp; Although he
attempts to steal the Dragonballs from Goku and his friends many times, he
becomes frozen with fear the instant he catches sight of Bulma.&nbsp; Later
Yamcha befriends the gang and helps them in their quest to find the Dragonballs
in hopes of wishing for a girlfriend.&nbsp; After traveling with the group for a
while, he gradually learns to deal with females and eventually faces his fear
head on when he saves Bulma’s life by carrying her out of Pilaf’s castle.&nbsp;
Although his dreams are dashed after Oolong makes a wish, he finds out Bulma had
planned to wish for a boyfriend.&nbsp; At this point she sees something
different in Yamcha, and they decide to date each other.&nbsp; However, after
Yamcha overcomes his phobia, by DBZ he becomes quite the ladies’ man, and as
Bulma discovers, he is not the most faithful of boyfriends.&nbsp; Yamcha dies in
the Saiyajin Saga when a kamikaze Seibaman latches onto his back and never lets
go.&nbsp; He travels along Snake Way to train under King Kai along with Tien and
Chaozu until the end of the Frieza Saga.&nbsp; Bulma eventually leaves Yamcha
for good, and the desert bandit is once again single.&nbsp; He changes his hair
almost as often as Bulma in the series, except that it seems to get shorter and
shorter.&nbsp; Yamcha seems to be almost a coward in comparison to the major
characters of DBZ.&nbsp; Although he is not as applied when it comes to
training, as he would rather goof off, he is quite brave considering he is one
of the weakest fighters on the field, and still he continues to help in any way
he can.&nbsp; By the end of DBZ, Yamcha returns to his vagabond life roaming the
desert with Puar. Yamcha is 6 feet tall, weighs 151 lbs, and was born in 733 AD,
the same year as Bulma.</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Yamuu</b> Once a normal human who fought in
the previous Tenkaichi Budoukai, Yamuu’s mind is controlled by Babidi during
the Buu Saga.&nbsp; As Spopovitch’s assistant, Yamuu is sent by Babidi to
collect energy for his master at the 25th Tenkaichi Budoukai.&nbsp; After
stealing energy from Gohan, Yamuu and Spopovitch return to their master Babidi
to deliver the energy to him.&nbsp; Babidi soon decides they have outlived their
usefulness and causes them both to explode.</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Zarbon - “Zaabon”</b> Tall, green and
handsome, Zarbon is a pretty-boy who works as Frieza’s right hand man.&nbsp;
With a normal power level of 23,000, he is a formidable opponent early in the
Frieza Saga.&nbsp; Little known to anyone is Zarbon’s remarkable ability to
transform into an ugly alligator-like creature in order to increase his power
level about 5,000.&nbsp; Few know of this ability that are still alive, because
Zarbon almost never transforms unless he has to.&nbsp; The reason he hates
transforming is because the process distorts his handsome features and his
smooth voice to those of a repulsive alligator-like monster with a raspy voice.&nbsp;
He is forced to transform to defeat Vegeta, and although Vegeta has known Zarbon
for most of his life, the Saiyajin prince had absolutely no knowledge of this
ability, and so is well unprepared in their first battle.&nbsp; The second time
Zarbon faces Vegeta, he again must transform to keep up with him.&nbsp; Bulma,
who stands nearby to watch the entire fight, undergoes the typical chain of
reactions that Zarbon expects of an onlooker especially a female one.&nbsp; She
goes gaga over him for the first several minutes of the battle, and then screams
in horror upon seeing him change from his beautiful figure into a hideous
monster. Although he transforms, this time it’s Zarbon who underestimates
Vegeta.&nbsp; The Saiyajin prince fires a blast point blank into his chest that
blows a huge hole right through Zarbon’s armor and him, and Vegeta blows him
into the water.</font>
