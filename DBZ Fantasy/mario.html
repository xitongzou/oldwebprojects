===============================================================================
1)STORY
===============================================================================
(Taken from the Instruction Booklet)

One day, while visiting Mario, Princess Toadstool was picking flowers in his
garden...

Suddenly, out if nowhere, Bowser appeared and grabbed the Princess again! (Like
you'd expect anyone else to?)

Mario hearing Toadstool's scream for help, sped off alone towards Bowser's
Keep.

After Mario trounced Bowser for the millionth time (this time they fought on
one of Bowser's chandeliers), everyone felt Bowser's Keep beginning to shake!

A HUGE sword crashed into Bowser's Keep! What's gonna happen now?

3)BATTLE PARTY
===============================================================================
Here is a description of all the characters that make up your party in the
game. At first you will only start off with Mario but gradually more and more
will join your party and you will be given the choice of switching between
which 3 you want to use in battle.

NOTE: FP means the amount of Flowers used by the special technique, Mg.P is the
      strength of the special technique and Lvl means the level that the
      character learns the technique.

It's A Mario! The worlds most famous stereotype hmmm.. maybe that's not so
true. If he was a common Italian-American stereotype he would live in New
Jersey and Bowser would be sleeping with the fishes by now. Anyhow, he is the
only character that has to be permanently in your team, so luckily he is one of
the best characters in the game. He has brutal physical attacks and fairly
strong special techniques which are his trademark Fireball and Jump attacks.

Mallow the frog err... marshmallow. French restraunts would be more popular if
the frogs they used looked and tasted like him. But anyway this poor little
chap joins Mario's party (permanently) because he finds out he's adopted and
wants to search for his real parents! (wouldn't his parents be confectionary
machines). Anyhow this little piece of fluff has devastating lightning based
attacks he also has the very useful "Psychopath" which shows how much HP the
enemy has and what it's thinking (if your timing's right). He also can be used
as a healer since he learns "HP Rain" fairly early.

The protector of the Star Road named "[Heart][Note]!?", He chose to inhibit a
doll by the name of "Geno" since it looked the strongest out of a bunch of
dolls, including Mario & Bowser. And he chose well, Geno is one of the best

Bowser has "bigger fish to fry!" so he teams up with Mario just this once.
Bowser's brute strength comes very handy in Mario's adventure. He's also great
for comic relief, God he cries a lot he's actually a big wuss.

 *****************
Ummm... I'm surprised Toadstool doesn't get constantly sexually harassed by
Bowser since their in the same party. Anyhow the spoilt and awfully pink
brat of the Mushroom Kingdom want's to prove her worth. Her main use here is as
the healer. We couldn't have her throwing flaming skulls at the enemy, that
would be too un-feminine.

Slap:       Toadstool gives the enemy a good Italian backhander (she must have
            learned from Mario), press the A button just before she slaps.
Parasol:    Toadstool pokes them in the eye with her parasol, press the A
            Button just before she opens it out.
War Fan / : Toadstool whacks the enemy in the jaw with the object, press the A
Frying Pan  Button just as she whacks them.

4)FAQ
===============================================================================
 _________________
|General Questions|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Q: Super Mario RPG, never heard of it?
A: You must either be younger then 7 or live in a PAL territory, since this
   game has never been converted to PAL (to my knowledge).

- - - - - - - - - -

Q: I am a diehard RPG gamer, will I like this game?
A: This is an extremely hard question to answer, since it relies on your
   personality. So i'll just say this: If you love RPG's but are willing to
   except slight anti-RPG elements then yes you will like this game.

- - - - - - - - - -

Q: Do you know anywhere that still sells this game?
A: According to Massoud1957, Funcoland and Babbages may have copies of it.

- - - - - - - - - -

Q: I live in a PAL territory so I got the NTSC version, but it doesn't work
   with my converter. Do you know how I can get it to work?
A: Yes actually I do, Super Mario RPG was released around the time Nintendo was
   getting very sneaky with imports, they put a device in Super Mario RPG &
   Super Mario World 2 which blocks the newest most up-to-date converters but
   doesn't block the older out-of-date ones. So get an older converter (I don't
   like your chances of getting one). Also make sure your converter is FX chip
   compatible, The NTSC slot should look like this:
                       _________________________________
                      |IIII IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII IIII|
                       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   The four pins on either side are for the FX chip.
   I use a "Fire SNES Game Converter- Europe Version MD-909" and I get fairly
   reliable results! I also hear the Action Replay Converters work well!

- - - - - - - - - -

Q: Is there a hidden character?, 5 seems like a odd number.
A: Well it is an odd number silly, but no there is no hidden character!

- - - - - - - - - -

Q: I heard Link (Legend of Zelda Series) & Samus Aran (Metroid Series) have
   cameos in this game?
A: Well very small ones. Link is found by staying in the Rose Town Inn after
   getting the 2nd Star, he will be sleeping in the other bed when you wake up,
   if you talk to him he will play the Room Clear sound from most of the
   Zelda games (I don't think it's in The Adventure of Link). Samus Aran is
   found sleeping in the Guest Room inside the Mushroom Kindgom Castle after
   getting the 5th Star.

- - - - - - - - - -

Q: Have you hacked any Pro Action Replay codes?
A: Well only a couple but there good! If I make more I'll create a PAR section
   or file. Note these codes haven't been *fully* tested, so use them at your
   own risk.

|Gameplay Questions|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Q: I was speaking to someone in the game and then the game suddenly jammed, the
   music is still playing and the screen is still animated, but Pressing "A"
   won't continue with the dialogue. What's Happening?
A: It's not jammed, the person you are talking to wants to see Mario jump. So
   simply press the B Button.

- - - - - - - - - -

Q: What is a "Recovery Mushroom"?

   screen to flash. They refill all of the Party's HP & FP.

- - - - - - - - - -

Q: What is a "Invincibility Star"?
A: This Star makes Mario invincible for a short time, meaning any enemies he
   runs into will be automatically defeated and Mario will get the Ex.Pts he
   would have got for defeating them normally in a battle.

- - - - - - - - - -

Q: How do the Slot Machine Boxes in Land's End work?
A: The first hit starts them up, then you have to hit them 3 more times to
   stop all the rollers, here is a table of prizes:

   3 Flowers: A Frog Coin
   3 Stars: A Frog Coin
   2 Mushrooms & a Star or a Flower: A "Recovery Mushroom"

- - - - - - - - - -

Q: What are the Flowers that jump to my characters during battle after I defeat
   something?
A: These are Bonus Flowers and they are not added to your FP, but they have
   a variety of effects on the game they are:

   HP MAX     | Character recovers all HP
   ONCE AGAIN | Character gets another turn in Battle
   ATTACK UP  | Attack power increases
   DEFENSE UP | Defensive power increases
   FREEBIE    | You can use that item again
   LUCKY      | After battle you will play the Egg Game

- - - - - - - - - -

Q: What is an "Abnormal Condition", and how do they effect your party?
A: An abnormal condition is a change in your characters status due to an enemy
   attack or even an item, here is a list of what they are and what they do:

                 Symptoms           Effects
   ------------+------------------+-------------------------------------

   Silence     | Cross over mouth | Victims can't use Special Techniques
   Sleep       | Slouched over    | Complete inactivity

- - - - - - - - - -

Q: I want to buy better Armour & Weapons but I'm flat broke, where & how do I
   accumulate Coins easily?
A: Well I find the easiest way by far is in the Kerokero Sewers, simply walk
   around and fight as many things as possible, apart from getting Coins from
   defeating enemies (get the Coin Trick for even better results) you also are
   likely to get Pure Water from defeating Hobgoblins and Big Boos, and you
   can sell Pure Water for a massive 75 Coins. Other good places to accumulate
   coins are the Treasure Boxes in Rose Way (Enter from Rose Town not Tadpole
   Pond), By jumping on the first Wiggler in the Forest Maze & By selling the
   Goodie Bag for 555 Coins.

Q: In what order do I look at the 2nd lot of paintings in Booster's Tower?
A: Scotish, Yellow Cap, Pirate, Mr. T, Magician & Viking. If you can't
   recognise the paintings from that description here is their order
   represented visually:

Q: I can't go anywhere new and Mallow wants me to talk to Frogfucius, but all
   Frogfucius does is sulk and talks about how he needs a snack?
A: Can you remember why Mallow needed that Frog Coin from Croco? Whoa.. I
   answered a question with a question.. freaky!

- - - - - - - - - -

Q: I want to buy all the items from Frogfucius' ex-pupil in the Seaside Town
   Elder's House, where & how do I accumulate Frog Coins easily?
A: Well if you have access to Land's End I suggest you play Scale the Cliff
   (enter Land's End from Bean Valley to get their faster), and then practice
   until you can scale the cliff in under 11 seconds so you get 5 Frog Coins
   (see the Mini-Games section for a Strategy) or by jumping on a single
   Shogun from the sand whirlpools head 3 times in a row. If you don't have
   access to Land's End the best way to get Frog Coins is to jump onto a
   single Wiggler's back 10 times in the Forest Maze. Also you can get the
   Cricket Jam from the Kero Sewers via the smoking cave in Land's End, then
   give it to Frogfucius and he'll give you 10 Frog Coins. Also you can sell
   the Bright Card to the mushroom person standing by the entrance of the
   Marrymore Hotel for 10 Frog Coins (He will offer you 100 coins, then 5
   Frog Coins, you need to turn down both offers).

   Kill the gold Chomp Chomp down there then jump around this corner until you
   hear a sound, then jump 2 more times in that spot. Now jump on the platform

|Item Questions|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Q: Should I sell the Goodie Bag?
A: Well you get 1 coin per use of the Goodie Bag and you can sell it for 555
   Coins, so you would have to use it more then 555 times for it to be worth
   keeping. So in other words you should sell it!

Q: Where do I get the Lamb's Lure?
A: The Lamb's Lure is not found, it's made. To make it get the Mystery Egg from
   the Treasure Hunter in Moleville & the B'Tub Ring from Item Shop inside

   guards the user from mortal blows.

- - - - - - - - - -

Q: How do I get the Lazy Shells?
A: You need to give the Gardener in Rose Town the Seed & the Fertilizer, he
   only appears after talking to the mouse in Monstro Town. The Seed is dropped
   by the Shy Away after you beat the Megasmilax & the Fertilizer is acquired
   by walking along the east edge of Nimbus Land after deafeating Valentina,
   you should find a invisible walkway that leads to the Shy Away that gives
   you the fertilizer. After planted a magical and mysterious vine will grow,
   if you climb it you will find yourself in the clouds where you will find the
   two Treasure Boxes that contain the shells.

5)WALKTHROUGH
===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
i)The Blue Star
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 _____________
|Bowser's Keep|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Well Mario starts off in Bowser's Keep doing what he does best (saving women
from mutated turtles). Anyway head up (um.. just to make sure there are no
misunderstanding with the walkthrough because of the isometric view here is
what each direction means in relation to the screen: Up= North West, Down=
South West, Left= North West & Right= South East. Anyway head up through the
big red doors. It doesn't really matter if you fight the Terrapins, as you get
nothing from the battles so just hold "Y" and dodge them on the way to the
next door. But...  when you get to the big red doors the Terrapins will ambush
you and you will have to fight four of them, simple tap "A" a lot and Mario
will punch them all out. Now head up through the next red door. The next room
is purely for show so just continue on and watch the bridge collapse from
behind you, then head up in this room until Mario looks up at Bowser on his
chandelier. Now Mario's First-Battle (kinda) will start.

------------------------------------
 BOWSER: 320 HP "Mario! It's time!"
 KINKLINK: 50 HP "<no thoughts>"
------------------------------------
Attacking Bowser is futile.. but attacking the Kinklink works like a charm!
Press the Y Button to use a special technique, then press Y Button again to
select "Jump", now press any direction on the Control Pad to move the cursor to
the Kinklink, then press the Y Button again and Mario will jump on the
Kinklink, if you do this twice the Kinklink will begin to fidget and Bowser's
chandelier will begin to fall.
------------------------------------

Now Bowser plays dirty and he throws two hammers at the Kinklink that's
holding up Mario's chandelier, so now Mario's chandelier begins to fall as well
and when it gets to the same level as Bowser's (physically impossible), Bowser
swipes at Mario but Mario counterattacks causing him to be flung up to the
Princess. But as Mario climbs up to save the Princess the castle begins to
shake and a sword thrusts itself into Bowser's Keep, this causes the Seven
Stars of the Star Road to shower all over the Mushroom Kingdom and it also
causes Mario to be flung out of the Keep and into his house, the "Pipe House".
 ___________
|Mario's Pad|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
After Toad does his little one-liner (err.. I'll show him how to use a door)
press "B" so Mario jumps off the clothes peg. Now exit the Pipe House and talk
to Toad pacing outside, he will insist you go and retrieve the Princess from
Bowser's Keep. So walk left & jump on the Save Point (the shiny box with the
"S" on it) then head right and exit to Bowser's Keep.
 _____________
|Bowser's Keep|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Mario goes to the front door of the Keep, but he is greeted by Exor the giant
sword that flung itself into the Keep. It tells Mario to get lost and destroys
the only bridge to Bowser's Keep. So now go back to Mario's Pad.
 ___________
|Mario's Pad|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Go into the Pipe House and talk to Toad gazing out of the window, Mario will
explain what happened then Toad will run away! So go outside and exit this area
... but Toad runs into you flinging you back. He gives you a Mushroom to say
sorry. Now Toad basically goes through a tutorial so just answer his question
and do what he tells you to do, at the end of it he'll give some Mushrooms.
Now save and exit to Mushroom Way.
 ____________
|Mushroom Way|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Simply follow the path and kill all the Goombas & Sky Troopas you can, simply
punch them out. There are two Treasure Boxes in this first section the first
one has 5 Coins & the other has 8 Coins, simply jump repetitively under the
boxes to get all the coins. Before you exit this section save Toad from the
Goomba that has cornered him, you will get a Honey Syrup for your troubles. Now
go to the next section. As soon as you walk into the next section a Goomba will
ambush you, let it! you need the Ex.Pts. Now walk up and jump on the Goomba
spinning around on a pink flower, then jump on the flower and when your facing
the left ledge press the B Button (be quick or Mario will get dizzy), now hit
the Treasure Box up there, it contains a Flower. Now jump back down onto the
spinning flower and press the B Button when your facing the right ledge, then
Jump up at the Sky Troopa that has captured Toad and defeat it, Toad will
reward you with a Flower Tab, so use it straight away. Near the exit is a
Treasure Box, walk under it and wait for the Goomba to attack you. Then jump
up and and get the contents, a "Recovery Mushroom". Now go to the next section.
This section has a Lakitu that throws Spikies down at Mario, fight them until
you get to level 3 then walk up to the Hammer Bro that has captured Toad, and
initiate a battle.

---------------------------------------
 HAMMER BRO: 50 HP "I love my hammer!"
 HAMMER BRO: 50 HP "I love my hammer!"
---------------------------------------
Two timed Jumps each should be enough to defeat them, but they may take more
if you are weak or if they use "Valor Up" which increases their defence. You
get a Flower Jar, 20 Coins & 6 Ex.Pts. for beating them, and...
---------------------------------------

One of the Hammer Bros. leaves their Hammer behind so immediately equip it and
use the Flower Jar, now exit to the Mushroom Kingdom.
 ________________
|Mushroom Kingdom|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You can go explore around this town, but before you enter the castle make sure
you save in the Inn. Once your finished exploring enter the castle get ready
as the next bit is tricky, after talking to Toad quickly jump on his head and
just as he is about to exit the room jump above the doorway, now jump again to
hit the Surprise Box with a Frog Coin (If you fudge it up hold L & R then press
Select and Start simultaneously, this will reset the game so you can try again)
Now follow Toad to the Chancellors Room, after Mario explains what happened to
the Chancellor he will tell Mario to save the Princess, he'll give him a Map &
he will tell you to go to the Vault. Also if you haven't equipped the Hammer
he will get Toad to explain how so do so if your lost. Now in the main hall
way, go right and talk to the Vault Guard standing in the staircase. Now hit
the 3 boxes, you will get 10 Coins, a Flower & a Recovery Mushroom. Now go
back up the stairs and head left going through the door way on the opposite
side of the hallway, now head up the stairs and continue heading up until you
get to "Toadstools Room". There is nothing much to do here, but if you search
the chair at the back of the room you will find "Toadstool's ???", but as soon
as you find it Toadstool's Grandma will quickly swap it for a Mushroom. So now
exit the castle. As you walk out of the castle you will see a marshmallow
called Mallow chasing a crocodile that has stolen his coin, he then starts
crying which causes it to rain. So walk up to him and talk to him and he will
ask you to help him get his Frog Coin back, so help him and he will join your
party. Now head to the Item Shop, after explaining to the Shopkeeper that his
Frog Coin has been stolen, Mallow will get a Pick Me Up from the sympathetic
Shopkeeper. Now from the Shop buy a Shirt, Pants, Jump Shoes & a Antidote Pin,
if you can't afford all that don't worry. You can buy a lot from this shop here
is a list, but I suggest you stock up on Honey Syrups.

Mushroom     |  4
Honey Syrup  | 10
Pick Me Up   |  5
Able Juice   |  4
Shirt        |  7
Pants        |  7
Jump Shoes   | 30
Antidote Pin | 28

Now go down the stairs in the back of the shop and talk to the man down there,
do what he says and you will uncover a Surprise Box with a Flower inside.
There is another box in this room but it is a little tricky, go back up the
stairs to the shop then go back down to this room, now jump on the guy's head
and wait until he walks near the top right corner then jump up to it and you
will uncover a Treasure Box with another Flower inside. Now exit the Inn and
talk to the Mushroom Retainer jumping up and down outside, Croco runs to
Bandit's Way so save in the Inn then exit to Bandit's Way.
 ____________
|Bandit's Way|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
In the first section simply follow Croco to the next section, if you get in any
battles in Bandit's Way just use Mario's Hammer and Mallow's Thunderbolt, the
only enemies that may cause you trouble are Frogogs so always make Mario attack
them first. In the next section there is spinning flower, so jump on it and
press "B" when you facing the ledge. Now jump from the yellow platform to
yellow platform collecting Coins on the way, then from the ledge they take you
to jump down on to the spinning flower and when Mario is facing the blue
stationary flower press "B" you will get a Kerokero Cola (sometimes it doesn't
work so just persevere until it works). Then head up to the next section,
follow Croco while fighting enemies on the way to the nest section, there is a
Treasure Box with a "Recovery Mushroom" being guarded by a K-9 to the right
before the path to the next section. In this section there are two yellow
platforms, jump on the right one then jump at the Treasure Box you will get a
"Invincibility Star" so now run into as many K-9's as you can, you will almost
certainly level-up. To get to the other Treasure Box jump on the right yellow
platform then when the other platform is to the right (screen wise) of Mario
jump to it, repeat until you get to the Treasure Box it has a Flower inside.
Now exit right to the next section. You have cornered Croco, firstly make sure
Mario & Mallow are at least Level 4, so fight enemies around here until you
are! Then hit the Treasure Box at the top of this section for a "Recovery
Mushroom". Now you can go after Croco you have to sneak up behind him 3 times
in order to fight him! His pattern is simple, he runs behind a island of
foliage then he waits for four seconds, then he faces the other direction and
waits for four seconds & then he runs behind another island of foliage, repeat!
After catching him 3 times you will have to fight him...

---------------------------------
 CROCO: 320 HP "Gosh, I'm good!"
---------------------------------
Croco is fairly easy, just get Mario to use Fire Orb on him and Mallow should
use HP Rain, Mushrooms & Honey Syrup when necessary, but he should use
Thunderbolt when he's not busy healing as his punch is very weak. The first
time Mario uses Fire Orb Croco will skip a go since he will be dousing a tail
fire. After you cause enough damage Mallow will click the shits and he'll pound
the Frog Coin out of Croco. You get 8 Ex.Pts, 10 Coins, a Flower Tab for
defeating Croco
---------------------------------

Croco also drops a wallet, now jump onto the trampoline that falls from the
sky, then save from the nearby save point and exit to the Mushroom Kingdom.
 ________________
|Mushroom Kingdom|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
When you come back the Mushroom Kingdom it is all gloomy and it's overridden
with Shysters. Quickly walk up to the Mushroom Retainer being chased by a
Shyster, after defeating the Shyster with Mario's Hammer and Mallow's
Thunderbolt attacks the Mushroom Retainer will give Mario 10 coins. Now go
inside the Item Shop and read the note on the counter, now stock up on items
you need (Honey Syrup is very useful soon). Now leave the shop and save the
blue mushroom person below from the Shyster, then give him back his Wallet and
he will give you a Flower Tab. You might as well save the guy that gets you to
jump and Raz & Rani from the Shysters, but don't expect anything from them. Now
go inside the double storey house just below the castle, then defeat the two
Shysters jumping on the furniture. Now you must go upstairs and save the boy up
there from the Shyster, then the father will give you a Flower Tab. Now exit
the house and go inside the castle, quickly run ahead and fight the Shyster
chasing Toad. Now you have to clear the way to Toadstool's Room for Toad. In
the room with stairs and two Shysters you only have to defeat the left Shyster
to clear the room. After Toad gets to Toadstool's Room tell him (You bet) and
you will get another Flower Tab. Now use your little collection of Flower Tabs
you have accumulated. Talk to the Princesses Grandma to get fully healed
then save. Now go back to the hallway and head left, then go up to the Guest
Room and talk to the Vault Guard shaking in terror in the corner, he will give
you the Wake Up Pin. So equip Mallow with it, then head down until your in the
Vault, you can hit the Treasure Boxes again to get 10 Coins, a Flower & a
Recovery Mushroom. Now make your way to the Chancellor's Room, after crashing
their party Mario will have to fight Mack the Knife and his Bodyguards.

-----------------------------------------
 MACK: 480 HP "Boing, boing, boing."
 and an unlimited supply of:
 BODYGUARD: 30 HP "Boing, boing, boing."
-----------------------------------------
I hope your at Level 6, cause if you are this is a breeze! Mario should use
his Hammer and Mallow should use his Thunderbolt special. The first time
Mallow uses Thunderbolt on Mack he will lose a go since he will be stunned.
There is a trick of leaving one Bodyguard alive so the Bodyguards regenerate,
but this is useless IMHO since they die as zoom as Mallow uses Thunderbolt, so
they never get to touch you anyway. If Mack jumps up out of sight don't worry,
he'll be back soon. You get 12 Ex.Pts & 20 Coins for defeating Mack the Knife
and his Bodyguards.
-----------------------------------------

Now the Blue Star will float to Mario. Congratulations! After the Shysters do
their incoherent dialogue walk up to the Chancellor shaking in the corner and
talk to him. Now after a little talk with the Chancellor, Mallow will suggest
to go to the Tadpole Pond to see his grandfather.

Go to the Item Shop and get Mallow his Cricket Pie. Also stock up on Mushrooms,
Honey Syrup, Able Juice & Pick Me Ups (at least have two of each in your
inventory. Now save in the Inn, before you leave jump on the kid running in
circles in the bottom right corner of town something slightly funny will
happen. Now exit and go to the Kero Sewers.
 ___________
|Kero Sewers|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Go down the green pipe (tap down). Now jump on the Save Box, then jump into the
water and swim right and up. To get out of the water go were the water is
shallow and press "B". The note near the pipe tells you the basics of pipe
travel, so read it if your lost. Then go down the pipe, then drop down to the
Pipe to the right and go down it. Now follow the path to the next pipe killing
The Big Boo on the way, then go down the pipe. In the next room drop off to the
right and jump up the stairs to get to the Treasure Box, but once you hit it
Pandorite appears. Use Mario's strongest Jump attack and get Mallow to punch it
as his Thunderbolt special does nothing. After the Pandorites defeated you'll
get 10 Ex.Pts, 30 Coins, a Flower Jar & a Trueform Pin, but that's not all exit
the room and re-enter, then hit the Treasure Box Pandorite was in multiple
times to get 50 Coins. To get back up to the higher level, climb the steps that
go to the Pandorite box, then walk down until you drop down one step, then
jump up to the higher level.  Now go up this zig-zagging section many Rat Funks
will ambush you on you way up. Hit the Box on the way up for a Flower then
go down the pipe at the end of the path. In the next section walk down and hit
the Treasure Box, you get an "Invincibility Star" so quickly run left and run
into the four Rat Funk's, then run due west and go down "Invincibility Star"
would have probably died out by now so now go down the pipe at the bottom of
the thin pathway. Jump up to the platform with the stationary Rat Funk then
jump over his head to the pipe below and go down it. Now go up the stairs on
your left and jump on the green exclamation button, then drop down and go down
the pipe you came up from, then drop down to the pipe that was submerged before
and go down it. Now head up and hit the Treasure Box to get a "Recovery
Mushroom" then jump on the nearby save box. Now go down the ahead, then walk up
to the ugly looking dog it's Belome. So get ready for a battle.

-----------------------------------------
 BELOME: 500 HP "I just...wanna sleep."
-----------------------------------------
This guy is pretty simple to beat if your on a reasonable level, Mario should
use his strongest Jump attack while Mallow should be the designated healer and
item user but try to get him to use Thunderbolt mainly. Belome usually swallows
Mallow half way through the fight, but don't worry he will spit him out after a
couple of turns or after you've dealt enough damage. It doesn't really matter
if he turns you into a Scarecrow as Physical Attacks aren't as effective as
special attacks, it will only hinder you if you need to use a Item. After a
while Belome will say "If you defeat me, you STILL won't beat me! Beware the
flood!" which indicates you have defeated him.
-----------------------------------------

Belome was sitting on a switch that controls the flood gates, so by defeating
him you have made the switch pop up and lots of water rush in. The water
sweeps our heroes into the ....

Toad gives you a little tutorial at the start of each of the sections, so let
him teach you if your lost. For a in-depth guide to this Mini-Game scroll down
to (Section 6: MINI-GAMES & SIDE-QUESTS). After you get to the end of this
Mini-Game the caretaker will give you a Frog Coin for every 60 Coins you
collected & he will also give you the "Nok Nok Shell". So equip Mario with it
straight away, then exit and go to the Tadpole Pond.
 ____________
|Tadpole Pond|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Walk up and stand on the lone stone and then some tadpoles will appear followed
by a mystical flying frog err.... actually it's Frogfucius. Now jump across the
bridge of tadpoles and talk to Frogfucius on his island. After listening to his
pearls of wisdom and the revelation that Mallow isn't a tadpole (whoa didn't
see that one coming) go and talk to him again, you will give him the Cricket
Pie which will cheer him up enough to give you the Froggie Stick. So equip it
onto Mallow and go back across the Tadpole Bridge. To the left is the "Frog
Coin Emporium" and the "Juice Bar", but you don't have a membership card yet
and your Frog Coin supply is to precious for later, so go right instead into
the Melody Bay. If you want to do this yourself read the canvas on Frogfucius'
island then talk to Toadofsky to get a small tutorial on music, but if not just
see (Section 6: MINI-GAMES & SIDE-QUESTS) for the solutions. After you play
Frogfucius' Suite #18 to Toadofsky you'll get the Alto Card from him, which
gives you a wider selection and better prices at the Juice Bar. Now save then
see what's in the "Frog Coin Emporium" here is a list of their inventory:

(In Frog Coins)
Sleep Bomb  | 1
Bracer      | 2
Energizer   | 2
Crystalline | 5
Power Blast | 5

then visit the Juice Bar, here is price list with the all the different cards:

              | None | Alto | Tenor | Soprano |
--------------+------+------+-------+---------+
Froggie Drink |   16 |   14 |   12  |     8   |

Megalixir     |  --- |  --- |   90  |    60   |
Kerokero Cola |  --- |  --- |  ---  |   200   |

Now exit to Rose Way.
 ________
|Rose Way|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Just for Rose Way take the Jump Shoes off Mario and put on the Wake Up Pin as
the Shyguys' Doom Reverb and the Snapdragons' Pollen Nap can cause you trouble.
Rose Way is full of yellow platforms bu the act different, read the note at the
start for a explanation. Jump on the first block then jump to the next block
when they meet up, after this platform floats to an island jump off to get a
"Recovery Mushroom". Now jump back on the platform then when it meets up with
the next platform jump to it. Stay on this platform till it takes you to an
island with a Flower, so collect the Flower and jump back on the platform. This
platform will take you to a platform you should jump on that takes you to the
entrance to the next section. In this section firstly defeat the Shyguys on the
swinging platforms, then jump from platform to platform to get to the Box with
a Frog Coin. If the platforms get out of sync jump up in front of one to hold
it back, if you keep on doing this you will eventually get them in sync.
Now exit this section and jump on the platform, stay on it until it takes you
to the entrance of the next section (If you time it right you can jump up to
collect the coin floating above the path of this platform). But anyway on to
the next section, the Crooks in this section are worth fighting they usually
run away, but if you defeat then they'll give you a fair amount of coins. There
is also a Lakitu with a Shyguy at the end of his fishing line, if you defeat
the Shyguy at the end of his line around 5 time he'll drop a "Recovery
Mushroom" down at you, now exit to the next section. Jump on the yellow
platform, firstly it travels down so jump on it again so it goes left, now jump
to the next platform while collecting the coin. Now on the next platform time
your jump so you collect the coins suspended above the path of the platform,
but don't jump to the next platform, instead go back and jump on the last
platform, then ride this platform so it goes to land then down to the next
platform you have to jump to. This platform takes you to an island with a coin
(so collect it) then to the entrance to the next section. The next section is a
free for all, so collect as many coins as you can and fight as many enemies as
you can before exiting to the next section. The next section has nothing but a
little "cinema" showing Bowser's fading army. Now exit and go to Rose Town.
 _________
|Rose Town|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
As soon as you enter Rose Town go in the Inn on the west side of the town.
Inside the Inn is a little boy playing with section figures, his name is Gaz.
Play with him and watch the unfolding events involving a wooden doll called
Geno. As soon as Mario wakes up save and head downstairs, listen to Gaz and
his mum's conversation then exit the Inn. In the top right corner of Rose Town
is an Item Shop, climb the crates on it's right side and go down it's chimney.
Now hit the Treasure Box up there for a Flower, then jump up along the
cupboard to the top left to uncover a Surprise Box with a Frog Coin inside.
Now buy some supplies from the two people inside, the mushroom boy on the left
sells these items:

Mushroom    |  4
Honey Syrup | 10
Pick Me Up  |  5
Able Juice  |  4

the mushroom girl on the right sells this equipment:

Thick Shirt  |  14
Thick Pants  |  14
Jump Shoes   |  30
Antidote Pin |  28
Wake Up Pin  |  42
Trueform Pin |  60
Fearless Pin | 130

So I would buy the Thick Shirt, Thick Pants & Fearless Pin from the girl, and I
would stock up on all items especially Able Juice as the enemies in the Forest
Maze use lots of "Abnormal Condition" attacks. Equip the Thick armours on our
heroes and equip the Fearless Pin on Mallow then sell the old armour. Now exit
and talk to the guy wandering in the top left corner of town, he has been cut
off from his own house so jump on his head and up into is house. The two boxes
in house contain Flowers at the moment but after you make the stairs appear
they will contain coins, so go upstairs jump on the switch then jump on the bed
to get a Frog Coin. Now exit the house and talk to the guy, he will give you
directions for the Forest Maze that are: Left, Left, Straight, Right. Now exit
to the Forest Maze.
 ___________
|Forest Maze|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
As soon as you enter the Forest Maze jump in the bottom left corner to uncover
a Surprise Box with a Kerokero Cola. There are lots of Mushroom around here but
pick them with caution as they could be an enemy called Amanita disguised.
Go left to the next section, there is a constant march of Wigglers coming from
the hollow in a stump, every time you jump on a Wiggler you'll get a Coin but
if you jump on a single Wiggler 10 times you'll get a Frog Coin. Go down the
stump (like a pipe) and make your way through the cave while watching out for
Amanita and jump on the trampoline at the end. As soon as you emerge from the
tree hollow walk left (NW) and jump to hit a Surprise Box with a Frog Coin
inside.  Now go up and left to the next section, this section has 7 hollow
stumps with Wigglers coming out of them. Go down the bottom right stump and
jump in the middle of the large light patch near the bottom for a Flower, now
jump on the trampoline & go down the middle left stump. Now jump in the light
coloured corner above the trampoline to uncover a Surprise Box with nothing!
inside. Now jump on the trampoline and go down the last stump, then jump behind
the sleeping Wiggler being careful not to touch him to uncover a Surprise Box
with a Kerokero Cola. Then wake the sleeping Wiggler by touching it, you will
be flung out of the cave but a new path will be open so go through it and down
the stump that the Wiggler goes down. Now follow this cave to the next section
fighting some Rat Funk's and Amanita's on the way, then in the next section
make your way to the trampoline and jump on it. Now head up and save but jump
in the top right corner before the exit to uncover a Surprise Box with Red
Essence inside. Now head up, this is why this Forest is a Maze, head in the
direction the man told you but follow them in Mario's perspective, so from our
perspective you'd go left, down, down then left. Now go down the stump and hit
the 5 boxes to get random items that are always either Frog Coins, Flowers or
Recovery Mushrooms. Now jump on the trampoline and exit back into the maze and
go right, up, up, right, up, left following Geno. Now walk forward and watch
Mario, Mallow & Geno get in a fight with Bowyer the Bow who has the Green Star.

-------------------------------------------
 BOWYER: 720 HP "What's with these folks?"

Get Geno to use his Geno Beam, Mario to use his Nok Nok Shell & Mallow to be
the designated healer and item user. After the first turn Bowyer will start
blocking button, so that strategy is only limited to the buttons you can use
but always give priority to the actions above. Note that Mallows Thunderbolt
special does minimal damage. After Bowyer is defeated you will get 20 Ex.Pts,
50 Coins & a Flower Box.
-------------------------------------------

Now Geno will explain who he is and the mystery of the stars and Mario will get
the Green Star.

iii)The Orange Star
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ___________
|Forest Maze|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Exit to Rose Town.
 _________
|Rose Town|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Look Rose Town is all cheery now! So go into Gaz's House (Rose Town Inn) and
talk to Gaz. After Geno tries to explain the concept of shooting stars to Gaz,
he will give Geno a Finger Shot. So Equip Geno with the Finger Shot and the
Trueform Pin, now exit and go to the Pipe Vault.
 __________
|Pipe Vault|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Go down the pipe. Now head up jumping over the lava to get to the next section,
time your jumps to avoid Sparkies if you wish. The next section is fairly easy
simply jump over Goombas and jump when the Thwomp is about to hit the ground,
then go down the 2nd pipe. Go down the next pipe, now run up ahead collecting
coins and when you get to the end press down to duck under and get the Frog
Coin, then jump on the trampoline. Go down the last pipe again (two back). Now
walk three blocks up and jump to uncover a hidden platform, so jump on it then
up to the higher platform. Now go four blocks ahead and jump to uncover a
Surprise Box with a Frog Coin, now go another four blocks ahead and jump up to
uncover another Surprise Box with a Flower, now jump down on the trampoline.
Now go down the next pipe this takes you to the "Goomba Thumpin' Mini-Game"
(see the Mini-Game section for a in-depth look at it). Now go down the last
pipe, just jump across the platforms and avoid the Piranha Plant in the red
pipe. Watch out for the "Walking Piranha Plants" (that's they're real name
seriously, I checked the Super Mario Bros. 3 Instruction Booklet) as you will
lose 2 coins every time you come in contact with them. Now head down the green
pipe at the end of this section. In the next section jump up on the floating
platform and hit the Box above it to get a Flower. Then make your way to the
next moving platform that is above the Walking Piranha Plants, the Box above
this platform is not worth hitting more then once or twice as you will lose
more coins in the process, if you try for more. Continue on you way to the next
pipe and go down it to emerge in Yo'ster Isle.
 ____________
|Yo'ster Isle|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Save after you emerge from the pipe then jump behind the Save Point to uncover
a Surprise Box with a Frog Coin inside, then head down to the main section of
Yo'ster Isle. Talk to Yoshi near the bottom right corner of the island and jump
on him, he now will be your interpreter. Now go and talk to the Red Yoshi near
the top of the island and tell him (Of Course) he will give you some Cookies.
Now go down and talk to the Blue Yoshi with shades (Boshi), you will get in
a race with him. Now Toad will give you a little tutorial on the Mushroom Derby
(see the Mini-Game section for a in-depth look at it) before you start racing,
if you win you'll get some Yoshi Cookies and you will be able to play the
proper Mushroom Derby whenever you want to. If you lose you will have to talk
to the Red Yoshi again to get Cookies then the Boshi to try again. Now exit and
go to Moleville.
 _________
|Moleville|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Go to the Item Shop and buy a Punch Glove, Cymbals & 3 Work Pants. Then equip
them all, also stock up on other items, here is a list of what's available:

Punch Glove  | 36
Finger Shot  | 50
Cymbals      | 42
Mega Shirt   | 22
Mega Cape    | 22
Mega Pants   | 22
Work Pants   | 22
Mid Mushroom | 20
Maple Syrup  | 30

Now save in the inn and head up to the mountains you will see the almost
vanquished Bowser Army march off, now head left and talk to the mole panicked
near the mountains entrance. She explains while gossiping to another mole, that
a star has landed in the mine, trapping two kids inside the Coal Mines, now
head into the mine.
 __________
|Coal Mines|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
As you enter the mine, the moles inside are thinking of a way to get to a
higher ledge, when they see you they'll ask if you'll save their kids, So
choose (Of Course) then jump on their shoulders and then jump up to the ledge
above, now go through the doorway and make your way through the room to the
next section. This next section has the Treasure Hunter and a teleporting
Sparky, talk to the Treasure Hunter then go through the doorway below. Now keep
heading up until you get to the trampoline then jump up on it, the only problem
is there is no hole above it so Mario whacks his head on the ceiling and gets
knocked out. During the time Mario is knocked out, Croco and his Crooks steal
all his coins. So start running on the tail, as you corner Croco and his Crooks
in the next room he'll bomb a way out. So keep following him. After he bombs
yet another wall go down then right and in the next room fight the Crook hiding
behind the crate near the end of the room, you get a Flower Tab for defeating
him. Now head right to the room with the trampoline, there is another Crook
behind the trampoline so defeat it to get another Flower Tab. Now head up to
the next room, there is another Crook behind the L-shaped crates so as before
defeat him for a Flower Tab. Now wait until Croco runs past or run around this
section the way he went the first time (running the opposite way may be
faster). Anyhow once you tackle him your in for a battle.

--------------------------------
 CROCO 750 HP "Ooh! I'm good!"
--------------------------------
Mario should use the Punch Glove or Super Jump on Croco, while Mallow should be
use Cymbals when he is not healing or using items and Geno should use the Geno
Beam. Half-way through the battle Croco will steal your items, so now you must
conserve FP for Mallow's HP Rain so everyone should use Physical Attacks now.
After he gives up you'll get 10 Ex.Pts, 50 Coins + the Coins he stole, your
items & the Bambino Bomb aswell!
--------------------------------

Now keep heading left in the mine until you get to the room that has/had a lone
Bob-omb then head up and talk to Pa'Mole, he will blow a hole in the rock using
the Bambino Bomb. So go through the hole and continue, go through the lower
passage and follow the railroad, but.. as you get to the end a Shyguy on a Mine
Cart will push you back blocking the lower section and dropping a Frog Coin for
you in the process. So now climb the boxes to the higher section and head up,
there is a Treasure Box ahead with a "Invincibility Star", so hit it and run
up, then head right, jump up the crates, to the higher section and head up now,
head left and run into the four Bob-ombs now save, backtrack to the last room
and hot the Treasure Box to get 150 Coins. Now go ahead and hit the Treasure
Box by the Save Point then save, now jump up on the stack of crates ahead and
jump right to get a Flower. Now head up and walk around the guy throwing bombs
and walk into his side. He is Punchinello and you have to fight him now..

-----------------------------------------------------------
 PUNCHINELLO: 1200 HP "Yeeha! I see we're already famous!"
 also he produces from his mouth:
 MIRCOBOMB: 30 HP "Small is as small does"
 BOB-OMB: 90 HP "Ouch.  HEY! Watch it!"
 MEZZO BOMB 150 HP "Look out!"
-----------------------------------------------------------
Mario & Geno should use physical attacks while Mallow should use Thunderbolt
to destroy the Bob-ombs. He starts off with Microbombs then after you do enough
damage he goes to Bob-ombs, then after you do even more damage he uses
Mezzo Bombs then finally once you defeat him he will stomp until a HUGE bomb
lands on him. Then coal lands on the wick which causes the bomb to explode.
-----------------------------------------------------------

The explosion causes the Orange Star to fall down so Mario can collect it. Now
head up to Dyna & Mite who are trying to get a Mine Cart to budge so talk to
Dyna then read the guidelines behind you, then your on your way (see the
Mini-Game section for an in-depth guide to Moleville Mountain).
 _________
|Moleville|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
After the old mine track leads off a cliff Mario, Dyna & Mite land through Ma'
& Pa'Moles roof safely, reuniting Dyna & Mite with their parents.

    ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
    ~ You've found Dyna, Mite and ~
    ~ a Star Piece...             ~
    ~ But, where is Toadstool!?   ~
    ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
iv)The Purple Star
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 _________
|Moleville|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
As you walk out of Ma' & Pa'Moles house you see a beetle being chased by some
Snifits, it lands on Mario's head and the Snifits try to persuade Mario to hand
over the beetle, as they do this they tell Mario that some guy called Booster
is entertaining the princess from the sky. After talking to some moles around
town you should realise that the princess from the sky is Toadstool. There is a
lot of cool stuff in Moleville now, there is the Bomb Shop in the top right
corner of town, this gives you bombs for points, you get points by giving them
items here is a points table:

Able Juice    | 10
Bracer        | 15
Energizer     | 20
Honey Syrup   |  4
Kerokero Cola | 40
Maple Syrup   | 12
Max Mushroom  | 30
Mid Mushroom  | 10
Mushroom      |  2
Pick Me Up    |  2
Pure Water    | 25
Red Essence   | 50
Royal Syrup   | 30

After you trade in 100 points worth of items you can choose between:

1)A "Fright Bomb" which allows
  you to make one enemy quiver
  in fright.
2)A "Fire Bomb" for a fire attack
  against all enemies.
3)A "Ice Bomb" for a ice attack
  against all enemies.

Also there is the Purtend Store but it isn't useful at the present time and
also there is an entrance to Molville Mountain on top of the mountain, but you
have to pay 10 Coins to get in or wager 30 Coins and if you beat the record
you'll get 50 Coins. Go into the Item Shop, the Treasure Hunter from the Coal
Mines has opened up a Miner's Store, you can only buy a Lucky Jewel for 100
Coins at the moment though. Now exit and talk to the little mole with the
yellow bow near the bomb shop, now enter the mine and head where Pa'Mole used
the Bambino Bomb, Then talk to one of the moles and they will start singing:

Diggin' deep in the "MI"nes~
"DO"n't get much sun!~
I'm covered with "SO"il~
'til my work day is "DO"ne~
I "RE"ally hate sititn'~
It's "LA"bor I choose!
'cause them's the "TI"me~
To "DO" them old Molville Blues!~

If you haven't noticed the solfege (Mi, Do, So, Do, Re, La, Ti & then Do) was
*hidden* in that song, so exit and go to the Tadpole Pond.
 ____________
|Tadpole Pond|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Now play the Moleville Blues to Toadofsky to get the Tenor Card if your having
trouble see Section 6: MINI-GAMES & SIDE-QUESTS. Now exit and go to Booster
Pass.
 ____________
|Booster Pass|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Booster Pass is full of Lakitus throwing Spikesters, but as soon as your enter
Booster Pass look behind the 2nd artichoke plant on your right to get a Frog
Coin. Now head to the far left of this section and jump on the artichoke plant
up on a hill, then jump again to uncover a Surprise Box with a Flower. Now head
right and up, but before you exit to the next section jump to the left of the
exit to uncover a Surprise Box with a Rock Candy inside. Now exit to the next
section, walk up along the lower section and collect the Flower growing from
the ground, then walk holding left along the left side of this section to walk
into a little concave, then jump left to land on a switch that fills in all the
holes in the higher section which kills all the Spikesters. Now head up and
exit and go to Booster Tower.
 _____________
|Booster Tower|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You'll find Bowser with no army crying about the good 'ol days at the foot of
Booster Tower, after Mario talks to him Princess Toadstool at the top of the
tower hears them ad screams down to Mario, then Bowser leaves. Now go up to
the front door and press "A", it's locked. So head down but... Bowser comes
running in and belts the door down, he then lets you join the "Koopa Troop". So
Bowser joins your party, the game will now show you how to switch between
characters. So switch Mallow with Bowser and enter the tower. Walk up to Snifit
by the desk and engage in a fight by talking to him, then walk left and climb
up the blocks to the higher section and take note of the order of the
paintings. Now go through the doorway to the next section, then climb up the
blocks. This section has a constant supply of Spookums coming from the next
doorway, walk to the black square one down from the top left square and jump to
uncover a Surprise Box with a Frog Coin inside. Now head to the next section,
this is where you meet Booster for the first time, follow the his mini train
track to where it exits to find a "Flower Tab", use it immediately then head
right to the next section. Climb up the blocks, if you want to avoid the
Rob-ombs hug the right wall and jump and run when there is a small gap. Then go
into the first door, now in this room jump off from the yellow block o the edge
of the platform and fall two spaces to the right. You will land on a teeter-
totter which will cause the bob-omb to be flung up and down, thus catapulting
you up to the Treasure Box with the Masher, equip it immediately as it is a
great weapon. Now exit and make your way back up to the room with the Rob-ombs
and this time go through the 2nd doorway. Now jump on the exclamation switch,
this opens up a new path in Booster Pass, then go to the next room. This is
a little novelty room, go through one curtain and come out the other and you
will become "Super Mario" from Super Mario Bros. , once you go to an exit Mario
will change back and then head to the next room. Make your way up the platforms
and around the Spookums (if you don't want to battle). Then talk to Snifit 3
who is shooting bullets at you, after defeating him go left to the next room.
Now using the same method as before for avoiding Rob-ombs (of you don't want to
battle) make your way to the next room and save. Then go right to the Ancestor
Hall, now walk up to the paintings and press "A" in the order you wrote down
before, if you do it right Booster will spit out the Elder Key at you. Use it
to open the door with the big key hole on this room, then enter and jump up to
get the Chomp, immediately equip Bowser with it. Now exit and go right to the
next room, make your way up to the teeter-totter with the Thwomp but before you
jump on it hit the nearby Treasure Box to get a "Recovery Mushroom". Jump on
the teeter-totter and you will be flung up to the next section. Now go to the
bottom left (west) corner of this platform and jump to uncover a Surprise Box
with a Frog Coin. Now make your way up the platforms avoiding the para-trooping
Spookums (but you really should fight them), on the platform before the stairs
go in the gap to the right of the stairs and jump to get a Frog Coin, then
climb the stairs and go to the next room. This is the Mine Room, if you walk
around on certain squares a instant battle with Fireballs with start you get
LUCKY flowers a lot for fighting them, anyhow collect all the coins and the
Room Key then go up through the door with the big key hole, this takes you to
a room with a Treasure Box that contains the Zoom Shoes. Equip them on Mario
then go back down to the Mine Room then left to the next room. Climb up to the
next room avoid the Chomp if you wish. In this room Booster comes in on his
train and throws Bob-ombs at Mario you can 1) Defeat all Bob-ombs, 2) Run
behind hollow painting or 3) Run down to next room, anyhow go to the next room.
Make you way up the steps to the next room. In this room climb up the yellow
blocks on the right then jump across to on top of the Treasure Box then jump
to uncover a Surprise Box with the Goodie Bag. Now drop down and hit the box
below to get a Frog Coin. Then jump in the bottom right corner before the exit
to uncover a Surprise Box with a "Recovery Mushroom" inside. Now switch Geno
with Mallow and save then head to the next room. Now head down and look at the
door, you will see Toadstool through the hole, but Booster walks in so Mario
runs behind the curtains. Now begins the Hide'n'Seek Curtain Game see Section 6
for further info) if you win you'll get the Amulet if you lose you will have to
fight Booster and his Snifits.

--------------------------------------------------------
 SNIFIT: 200 HP "Minimum wage for THIS?!"
 SNIFIT: 200 HP "Minimum wage for THIS?!"
 SNIFIT: 200 HP "Minimum wage for THIS?!"
 BOOSTER: 800 HP "This is like realizing you're outside
                  without your clothes on!
--------------------------------------------------------
Firstly you have to take out all 3 Snifits, use Mallows Thunderbolt to take 'em
out, really no big deal! Then you have to fight Booster, just use Physical
Attacks on him and get Mallow to use HP Rain when it's needed. Mario's Jump
attacks work pretty well too! He should be down in no time. You get 22 Ex.Pts,
145 Coins & a Flower Box for defeating him!
--------------------------------------------------------

Now go down and you will have to fight the Guys.

---------------------------------------------
 GRATE GUY: 900 HP "Peace is just a dream."
 KNIFE GUY: 700 HP "Happiness is hip!"
---------------------------------------------
Mario should use his strongest fire attack available on Knife Guy. Mallow
should use Thunderbolt, while using Honey Syrup & HP Rain periodically. And
Bowser should just use his Chomp on what ever Gut seems to be taking the least
beating. I think when the jump up on each other there power increases so try to
attack them furiously at this point, after a while they will buy the farm, so
to speak.
---------------------------------------------

Now our heroes will jump down and run to Booster Hill to follow Booster.
 ____________
|Booster Hill|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You have to compete with Booster in a race to the top of the hill. Booster
always wins but you can increase your Flower Points a lot by trying your best.
Toad gives you a little tutorial so take it if your lost. Jump on the Barrels
to be boosted forward then run into Booster & the Princess to get a Flower.
When the Snifits start running amok jump on them to, to get a boost. After you
make it to the top it's off to Marrymore. You can always come back here to pick
flowers but the real use for Booster Hill is for Beetle Collecting later.
 _________
|Marrymore|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Now go in the Marrymore Hotel just ahead to the left, stock up on items and buy
the Happy Pants, Happy Shirt, Hand Gun & the Whomp Glove. Here is a list of
their stock:

Super Hammer |  70
Hand Gun     |  75
Whomp Glove  |  72
Chomp Shell  |  60
Happy Shirt  |  38
Happy Pants  |  38
Happy Cape   |  38
Happy Shell  |  38
B'Tub Ring   | 145
Mid Mushroom |  20
Maple Syrup  |  30

The Super Hammer is weaker then the Masher and the Chomp Shell is weaker then
the Chomp. Equip the Happy Pants & Happy Shirt on to Mallow and Mario
respectively, then equip the Work Pants on to Bowser. As Mario and Mallow have
low defence, so the increase in attack you get from the Work Pants is cancelled
out by it's inferiority in the defence apartment. Also equip the Hand Gun onto
Geno & the Whomp Glove onto Mallow. Accessory wise, Mario should be wearing the
Jump Shoes, Bowser the Amulet, Geno the Wake Up Pin & Mallow should wear the
Zoom Shoes. Then switch Mallow with Geno. Now go up the stairs in the Marrymore
Hotel and go in the first door, then jump on the high bookcase and jump to
uncover a Surprise Box with a Frog Coin. You can also rest in this Hotel the
Regular Room costs 10 Coins and is a normal rest stop. But the Deluxe Suite
costs 150 dollars and you get room service (Pick Me Up for 10 Coins & Kerokero
Cola for 150), working shower & a big bed. You also have to pay the bellhop 10
Coins tip whenever you use him (if you don't you wont get a item from him).
You get a Flower Tab for staying in the suite the first time, but you also can
get items from the bellhop, talk to him at the bottom of the staircase after
you have spent the night and tell him (You betcha), he will give you Mid
Mushrooms, Pick Me Ups, Max Mushrooms & etc. Depending on how many times you
have stayed in the suite and how much you tipped him. Don't worry about
Toadstool yet instead exit and go to Booster Pass.
 ____________
|Booster Pass|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Enter the newly opened section to the left of the Lakitus, now jump across the
rock platform avoiding the Spikeys and an apprentice Snifit will attack you. If
he beats you (you would have to suck pretty bad) he becomes Snifit 4, you can
keep on losing to the apprentices here to make up to Snifit 7. They all go to
the top of Booster Tower. Anyway, after beating the apprentice keep heading
over the platforms until you get to a platform with three Boxes, hit them to
get a Kerokero Cola, a Frog Coin & a Flower. Now exit and go back to Marrymore.
 _________
|Marrymore|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Now head up to the chapel and talk to one of th guests outside, suddenly Raz &
Rani will get kicked out by a Snifit. So go behind the right steeple and you
will find a hidden entrance. Now go down the stairs and jump on the cake for
shits and giggles. Then go upstairs to the left, now help the Snifit break the
door down by running in unison with him, so run up when he touches the ground.
You make it through but they close the door on you, so save then walk to the
door and press "A". Now help Bowser break the door down the same way you did it
with the Snifit. The breaking down of the door causes Toadstool to fly back and
all her stuff goes everywhere. Now starts the little mini-game, the only prize
being a kiss from Toastool, simply talk to all 3 Snifits to get the Ring,
Brooch and Shoe then jump on Boosters head to get the crown, then talk to
Booster. Who kisses who relies on how fast you were i.e how many candles lit.

1 to 2 candles lit - Princess kisses Mario & Bowser kisses Booster.
3 to 4 candles lit - Bowser kisses Mario.
4 to 5 candles lit - Booster kisses Mario.
5 to 6 candles lit - Bower and Booster both kiss Mario.

Now the Toadstool is saved, but before you can take her safely to the Mushroom
Kingdom you must fight...

---------------------------------------
 TORTE: 100 HP "Cake! Vatch zee CAKE."
 TORTE: 100 HP "Cake! Vatch zee CAKE."
 BUNDT: 900 HP "Congratulations."
 RASPBERRY: 600 HP "Congratulations!"
---------------------------------------
Torte and his apprentice are invincible, so just focus on the cake (Bundt) and
hit it with physical attacks, after it moves twice the chefs will get scared
and run away. Now just get Mario & Bowser to continue attacking Bundt while
Geno uses items to heal, but he still should attack every now and again. As
long as you hit him more then twice a turn, you will eventually put out all its
candles therefore defeating it. Now you have to fight the lower level of the
cake (Raspberry), so just get everyone to use physical attack and eventually
Booster and the Snifits will come running in which mean you have deafeated the
wedding cake. You get 25 coins for beating it.
---------------------------------------

Now after Booster eats the cake, exit this part of the chapel and save. Raz &
Rani wil now go in and get married, now exit to the Mushroom Kingdom (If your
bored try exiting out of the west exit and tell all the characters "No"
eventually they will all gang up and bash Mario. Anyway exit out of the east
exit and you will automatically go to the Mushroom Kingdom.
 ________________
|Mushroom Kingdom|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Now while your in the Mushroom Kingdom talk to the guy you returned the wallet
to, he'll give you a Frog Coin. Now head to the Chancellor's Room, after the
big reunion and everyone tells their life story, Toadstool leaves the party as
fast as she joined it. So exit the castle, but as you exit Toadstool floats
down using her parasol and she rejoins your party. So switch Bowser with her
immediately. Now go in the Inn and talk to the kid in the top right corner
playing a Game Boy, keep bugging him and he'll eventually offer it to you for
500 Coins, you may as well buy it if you have the money 'cause it's pretty fun.
You can always come back to buy it. Press "X" after buying it, and the game
will show you how to access it, see Beetle Mania in Section 6: MINI-GAMES &
SIDE-QUESTS for a in-depth look at it. Now exit and go to the Tadpole Pond.
 ____________
|Tadpole Pond|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Go talk to Frogfucius, he wil tell you that a star has been sighted on Star
Hill. So now exit and got to Star Hill (west of Marrymore).
 _________
|Star Hill|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The enemies here are fairly strong especially the rare Mastadoom, make sure you
stock up on items. Walk to the left and up to the green star flower and press
"A" to activate it, the giant star will open up so enter it. After Geno talks
walk around and activate all 5 of the star flowers, also press "A" next to a
small star with a face to see someones dreams. If you have trouble finding the
last 2 star flowers look behind the big star, to get to it from the left side
of the big star. Once activated head to the big star and go through it. now
activate all 6 star flowers around the perimeter of this section then go
through the big star. Now walk up to find the Purple Star.

|Star Hill|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Now activate the last 6 flowers then go through the big star to exit from the
Star Hill, now go to Seaside Town.
 ____________
|Seaside Town|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Explore the town (the people are very weird at the moment) and enter the door
bottom door out of the three on the left, this shop sells rare items that can
really only be otherwise acquired through the "Bomb Shop" in Moleville or
through Yoshi Cookies. They sell:

Bad Mushroom |  30
Muku Cookie  |  69
Fright Bomb  | 100
Fire Bomb    | 200
Ice Bomb     | 250

So but what you want then head to the Elders House in the very top right corner
of town. Now talk to the Elder inside and he will tell you to retrieve the star
that fell in the sea. Now go upstairs and talk to the Frog up there, he is an
ex-pupil of Frogfucius and he sells extremely good items for major amounts of
Frog Coins, he is a list of his inventory (in Frog Coins ofcourse).

See Ya        | 10
Earlier Times | 15
Exp. Booster  | 22
Coin Trick    | 36
Scrooge Ring  | 50

I doubt very much that you will have enough Frog Coins to by the lot, so here
is the order in which you should by them: Exp. Booster, Scrooge Ring, Coin
Trick, See Ya & then Earlier Times.
Now go in the Inn and save, when you wake up the guy is watching you sleep
(ewww.. creepy), now save downstairs and exit the Seaside Town and go to the
Sea.

Buy the Hurly Glove and all the armour then equip it all. Now head down through
the path on the right to the next section. Now walk down and drop down below
the Treasure Box and jump up at it, it's a "Invincibility Star so quickly
head up in the room killing the Starfish (Zeostar) now jump up onto the ledge
on your left and run down killing more Zeostar then drop down and head into the
next section, then run through this section killing as many Zeostars as
possible as the Star will probably run out about now. Now head left the head
up, in the top left corner you will find a doorway so go through it. This room
contains three Treasure Boxes containing a "Recovery Mushroom", a Flower & a
Frog Coin. Then jump on the crates and jump down onto the Save Box. Now go up
and head to the room with all the starfish that had the secret doorway. Now
head down and jump in the water in the next room and swim to the whirlpool,
this causes Mario to sink. So now walk up and to the left in the water it will
take you to a grotto. Walk to were the bubble are coming from, this will cause
Mario to float to the surface. Now jump out of the water and hit the Treasure
Box for a Max Mushroom.  Then head down into the next section, this is *the*

|Sunken Ship|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Welcome to the mysterious Sunken Ship, there are notes scattered everywhere so
read them for a background story on the ship. Firstly make sure Mallow and Geno
are in your party then go up and save in that room then head back and to the
left to the next room. This room like many other rooms in this ship have
randomly appearing ghosts (so watch out), head to the next room. This room has
many Dry Bones, these guys are resistant to physical attacks but a single
special technique will defeat them. Also defeating them doesn't clear them
from the play area, anyhow head to the next room. Now jump on the crates on
your right and drop down into the back right corner, you'll get a flower. Then
head down the stairs and fight some Alley Rats. Now jump on the stack of crates
before the exit then jump onto the higher crates then jump repetitively to get
100 coins from the Treasure Box, go to the next room once you've done that. Now
head left to the first room and fight the Greaper so you can go through. This
is Clue Room 1, to get the clue head left of the pylon with the cannonball on
top of it. Then quickly run around the pylon to the other side that is below
the green exclamation switch. This will cause the Para Trooper to bump the
cannonball on to the switch, now collect the "Recovery Mushroom" and the 1st
clue which is:

> Memo left by Magellean:
> There is a "S" in the word.

Now exit and fight the next Greaper to get into Clue Room 2, Now hit the 1st
blue hook block (bottom) when the corresponding trampoline is on the top edge
of the spotlight. Then hit the 2nd blue hook block (middle) when the
corresponding trampoline is on the far top edge of the spotlight, then finally
hit the 3rd blue hook box (top) when the corresponding trampoline is slightly
lower then the middle spotlight. Now collect the Flower and the 2nd Clue:

> Memo left by Magellean:
> It is found on the bed of the ocean.

Now exit and fight the next Greaper to get into Clue Room 3, This room is a
maze but is too hard to make ascii drawing of it or to give you directions so
just navigate through it yourself and jump on the green exclamation switch and
collect the "Royal Syrup" and the 3rd Clue which is:

> Memo left by DeGama:
> It has two vowels.

Now exit and head down to the next room, this room has the Shamen again selling
the same items he did before so stock up & a Treasure Box guarded by a Dry
Bones, but you must defeat the Dry Bones many times to get all the coins from
it. After you've finished head to the next room and fight the next Greaper to
get into Clue Room 4, in this room follow the coin around the parameter
collecting all of the coins it drops while not touching the main moving coin,
then once finished collect it and then the 4th Clue which is:

> Memo left by DeGama:
> It has four consonants.

Now exit and fight the next Greaper to access Clue Room 5, In this room you
have to hit the lowest blue hook block, then you have to run under the next
blue hook block and headbutt the cannonball into it, keep ding this until all
block have been hit. Then collect the Mushroom and collect the 5th clue:

> Memo left by Van Doren:
> Two consonants are side by side

Then fight the next Greaper and enter the last clue room, climb the barrel
stack and jump around up their till a barrel is dislodged. Now face right and
jump on it till it rolls on a switch, now jump on the other switch and collect
the "Recovery Mushroom" and the last clue which is:

> Memo left by Van Doren:
> The "r" comes before the "l".

Now save and head up to the next room, in this room enter the password and then
press "A' when your facing inside the brass pipe, if the door doesn't open see
the FAQ for the Answer. Now go into the door but make sure someone is equipped
with the Fearless Pin.

-------------------------------------------------
 TENTACLES: 200 HP "You wouldn't...EAT me?!"
 TENTACLES: 260 HP "Keep me in cool!"
 TENTACLES: 260 HP "Keep me in cool!"
 TENTACLES: 200 HP "You wouldn't...EAT me?!"
 TENTACLES: 200 HP "You wouldn't...EAT me?!"
 TENTACLES: 260 HP "Keep me in cool!"
 KING CALAMARI: 800 HP "The ship's MINE! SCRAM!"
-------------------------------------------------
Just as a starting note, don't worry if your party members get flung off screen
by the tentacles. They will come back soon scared as it is a fear attack.
Anyway, firstly defeat the first 2 sets of 3 tentacles by getting Mario to
use his strongest Fire attack, Geno to attack normally and Mallow should heal
and use items or use Thunderbolt. After those two waves sets are done attack
the tentacles either side of King Calamari, then attack King Calamari with full
force (i.e Super Flame, Hand Gun & Whomp Glove) until he is defeated. You get
34 Ex.Pts and 100 Coins for defeating him.
-------------------------------------------------

Now head up to the next room then jump up to the higher door and enter it. You
can have two plans of attack in this room either: 1) Kill all of the Alley Rats
for a clear way to the next room or 2) Hold "Y" and run like hell to the next
room. Now go down the stairs and fight some Ally Rats then go to the next room,
now go to the top left corner of the room and jump on the barrels the jump over
to the platform with the two boxes, ht them repetitively for 200 Coins, now go
up to the next room. There is a Surprise Box in this room, firstly jump in the
bottom right corner of the middle spot light, then jump on the doppelganger
Mario to reach the Treasure Box which has a Kerokero Cola inside. Then go out
the next door and head down to the next room. In this room go behind the
stacks of crates and up behind them, you will find a hidden room with a
Treasure Box that has a Frog Coin inside, so hit the box then head back into
the last room then go down the stairs to the next room. Now hit the Treasure
Box for a "Recovery Mushroom" then save, now climb over the wall and hit the
Treasure Box, Hidon is inside so use physical attacks and Mario's Super Jump on
him and use Mallows Thunderbolt whenever he produces Goombettes, after he bites
the dust you get 17 Ex.pts, 100 Coins and the Safety Badge. Now climb back over
the wall and exit this room via the stairs, then go back down the stairs and
save, then climb back over the wall and hit the Treasure Box repetitively for
100 coins. Now head up twice and jump on the water, then swim to the whirlpool.
Now walk down and collect the 5 Frog Coins. You have to head up twice now, then
go down the stairs killing as many star fish as you can handle as you make it
to the next room. To get into a secret room head behind the crates and press
right then up, this secret room has the Safety Ring. Exit the secret room and
and climb the crates to the far right until you surface, when you surface head
left avoiding the whirlpool to get to a Frog Coin so jump out of the water to
get it, now head right into the next room. As soon as you enter some sharks
called Bandana Reds will attack you, use Mallow's Thunderbolt and physical
attacks to beat them, after beating them hit the Treasure Box for a "Recovery
Mushroom" then head upstairs, after the clumsy sharks stuff up keep heading up
the stairs... to were you fight more Bandana Reds, so use the same approach and
when they are defeated head up to where you fight Jonathan Jones the pirate
shark.

----------------------------------------------
 JOHNNY: 820 HP "Whoa! It's all over."
 BANDANA BLUE: 150 HP "Color me Blue, mates!"
 BANDANA BLUE: 150 HP "Color me Blue, mates!"
 BANDANA BLUE: 150 HP "Color me Blue, mates!"
 BANDANA BLUE: 150 HP "Color me Blue, mates!"
----------------------------------------------
Get Mario & Geno to use physical attacks on Johnny while
Mallow uses Thunderbolt to defeat the Bandana Blues and heals occasionally.
Then when it's one on one get Mario to use physical attacks while healing
periodically (every 3 or so turns). But if you want to avoid the 1 on 1 battle
get Mario, Mallow & Geno to pick one Bandana Blue each to attack with physical
attacks, then when there is only Johnny and a Bandana Blue left get everyone
to concentrate on Johnny. You get 44 Ex.pts and 50 Coins for defeating Johnny.
----------------------------------------------

Mario gets the Marine Star, but only temporarily. Head up and jump on the
trampoline to exit the Sunken Ship, then head to the Seaside Town.
 ____________
|Seaside Town|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
As you enter the Seaside town all the weird inhabitants confront you to hand
over the star, hand it over straight away. Now switch Mallow with the Princess
and head to the west side of town were you will fight Yaridovich the Spear...

------------------------------------------------
 YARIDOVICH 1500 HP "My promotion's at stake!"
 and his Mirage Attack produces:
 YARIDOVICH 500 HP "I'm not the real McCoy!"
------------------------------------------------
Just get all your character to use physical attacks in him, don't worry if he
uses the Mirage Attack as if you attack him the turn before it will
automatically select the right one. Get Toadstool to use Group Hug fairly often
as his attacks like Water Blast can kill the whole party off. Once defeated
Yaridovich gives you 40 Ex.pts and 50 Coins.
------------------------------------------------

Thanks to the help of your new friend Johnny, you have the Marine Star again.

 __________
|Land's End|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
As you enter Land's End save. Now jump in the Pot Cannon (enter it like a pipe)
then when it flicks forward press "B" you will fling over to a yellow platform
or over it to the ledge. From the yellow platform jump up (screen wise) when
the platform is at its highest point while you hold "Y" you will uncover a
Surprise Box with a Flower inside, then head up to the next section. Jump
between the platform with the Pot Cannon and the higher ledge to uncover a
floating yellowplatform, then jump in the Pot Cannon and press "B" when it is
about to rock forward now after you land on the platform or in the hole with
the 2 chows, jump in the spot just below the chow hole to uncover another
yellow platform. Jump back down in to the Pot Cannon and if you time it right
you will be flung up to the higher yellow platform. From here jump when it is
below the Treasure Box to get a Frog Coin, then jump to the highest ledge and
jump in the most western corner to uncover a Surprise Box with a Kerokero Cola
inside. Now head to the next section. Jump across the platforms and fight
Geckits up to the next section, if you fall off enter the bottom Pot Cannon to
blast yourself back up. Save in the next section then head right to where there
are two blue flowers, jump on the top one, hold "Y" and jump down to uncover a
Surprise Box with a Frog Coin inside. Now head back left and make your way up
the ledges using the sinning flowers to get up to the next section. This is the
Sky Bridge, so talk to the Shamen if you want to play (See Section 6) also if
you drop down you can do the Cricket Jam Side Quest (Also see Section 6). Make
your way across the Sky Bridge and up to the next section. Talk to the mouse
and save, then head to the next section. The basic idea here is to go down the
sand whirlpools that have the Shoguns in them, after going down a whirlpool
that is one out of a possible two head up and talk to the mouse, now head back
down and go down the last Shogun guarded sand whirlpool. Now your in a cave,
save then drop down and hit the Treasure Box, it's a "Invincibility Star" so
begin running upwards into as many enemies as you can, eventually you will land
in a cave full of Geckits the effects of the star will be gone by now. So head
left and jump over the stack of crates and talk to Shamen (you can just see)
he will sell you a star for 400 Coins. You can buy it to clear all the Geckits
in the room for lots of Ex.pts, after your finished head up to the next
section. This is the Belome Temple, The Shamen on the trampoline will let you
use the trampoline for ever if you pay him 100 Coins, it's not worth paying
yet. So head up to the next section and jump repetitively under the Treasure
Box for 50 Coins. Talk to the Shamen to get your "fortune" read, you fortune
depends on the order you it the Belome Statues tongues. If they are labelled
1,2 & 3 from left to right the combinations look like this:

1 / 2 / 3 = A Yoshi Cookie or a "Recovery Mushroom"
1 / 3 / 2 = A Yoshi Cookie
2 / 1 / 3 = 3 Chows
2 / 3 / 1 = 3 Chows or a Shy Away
3 / 1 / 2 = 100 Coins or a Frog Coin
3 / 2 / 1 = 100 Coins

Now jump on the brick step that fell down and collect your fortune, then jump
up to the next section. Go down the pipe and hit the Treasure Box or fight the
enemy(ies) then head up to the next room. Hit the Box for lots of coins then
jump up on top of it using the bricks on the left and jump to uncover a
Surprise Box with a Frog Coin inside. Now go down the stairs and jump in the
corner just above the end of the stairs to uncover a Surprise Box with another
Frog Coin. Now head up and hit the other Box for another Frog Coin, head up to
the next room. Hit the Belome Statues tongue to get another fortune, if it's
"Mmm, I'm so hungry! Wish I had something to eat" you can jump on the yellow
elevator platform. But if you got "Sorry, I'm not accepting visitors past my
bedtime", exit, re-enter and hit the tongue again until you get the desirable
message. After going down the elevator head up and down the pipe to fight
Belome...

------------------------------------------------
 BELOME: 1200 HP "Gotta yummy in my tummy!"
 he also produces the following enemies:
 MARIO CLONE: 200 HP "......"

 GENO CLONE: 250 HP "Star Pieces...Star...
 BOWSER CLONE: 300 HP "Gr...my castle...
 TOADSTOOL 2: 120 HP "It's tough to be pretty!"
------------------------------------------------
Get Marri to use physical attacks, Geno should use Geno Boost once on Mario but
the after that he should use Geno Beam when it is just Belome and Geno Blast
when he has clones as well & Princess should use physical attacks when she is
not using Group Hug or Items. Only attack the clones with physical attacks when
Belome is defeated! You get around 41 Exp.pts and 20 Coins for beating Belome.
------------------------------------------------

Now Belome is defeated jump on the exclamation switch, then head up to the next
room, talk to the mouse then go down the pipe to go to Monstro Town.
 ____________
|Monstro Town|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Head into the first door and talk to the mushroom person in there, she is
Monstermama and she tells you that the star is upstairs. So go upstairs, as you
see there is just a sea star up there talk to it and it will play the "Star
Lullaby". While your up there talk to the mouse to unlock a previously
inaccesable part of Rose Town. Now go back down stairs and talk to Monstermama,
she gets Sergeant Flutters Para Troopas to help you get up to the Bean Valley.

Monstro Town more. Enter the next door down, this room has the Chow that awards
you if you do more then 30 or 100 Super Jumps, talk to the Thwomp seven times
then walk outside and collect the Temple Key that is now laying on the ground.
The next room takes you to a battle with a boss called Culex but you must have
the shiny stone to enter (see Section 6) It's a good idea to save before
fighting him. Now go into the next door which is the Item Shop, One of Bowsers
old troops is making a living here, buy the Spiked Link and the Courage Shell
the equip them, here is a list of there inventory:

Spiked Link   | 94

press "A" to have a sleep and to compete in "Hide the Flag" (see Section 6).
Now exit and head up the stairs to Jinx's Dojo. Jagger one of Bowsers old
troops is inside, talk to him to compete in the Dojo Tournament (see Section 6
for info on winning), exit the dojo and save by dropping into the hole in the
bottom right corner of town. Head into the most right door, jump in the bottom

you get that message head down the elevator, then head right and into the
Golden Belome. Give him the Temple Key then go and collect the 8 Frog Coins,
2 Flowers, a Fire Bomb, a Royal Syrup & a Max Mushroom. Now backtrack through
the temple until you get to the section with the Trampoline that has a Shamen
on it. Give him the 100 Coins if you already haven't then jump on the
Trampoline, you will emerge in the sand section. Head up to meet the Para
Troopas so you can "Scale the Cliff" (see section 6, god you have to look at

otherwise head into the top left door and follow it up into a room with stairs.
After defeating the Jawful jump where he was standing to uncover a Surprise Box
with a Frog Coin inside. Now from below the Surprise Box you just uncovered
head directly down (screen wise), follow the hidden path to a dead end then
jump to uncover a Surprise Box with another Frog Coin inside. Now head right
to the next room, you have found all the capture people of Nimbus Land. Talk to
the guy on the far left to get Castle Key 1, then talk to the marshmallow
person wearing blue. Head left, up the stairs then down twice to get to back to
the hallway. Fight the Heavy Troopa then press A to open the middle door and
head up, the Shy Away in the next room is watering an egg (don't ask why), so
walk up to the egg, talk to it then select (Sure) you will now fight Shelly...

--------------------------------------
 SHELLY: 500 HP "Slow down!"
 BIRDO: 777 HP "I just love life!"
 she produces these if you defend:
 EGGBERT: 10 HP "What a glorious day!
--------------------------------------
Attack Shelly till the shell breaks open and Birdo pops out. Once Birdo appears
simply use physical attacks on her while Princess uses Group Hug occasionally.
Also if you defend the eggs that Birdo shots at you Eggberts will surround
Birdo, and if you attack Eggberts they will explode causing 80 Hit Points worth
of damage. This isn't practical though cause you could have caused more damage
by attacking those turns. Eventually Birdo will give you, giving you around
20 Ex.Pts and 30 Coins.
--------------------------------------

Collect the Castle Key 2 that Birdo throws out. Use it to open the door behind
the egg by pressing "A", then head up. Fight the Pinwheel immediately or he
will blow you off the platform, then jump on the Treasure Box and jump again
uncover a Surprise Box with a Frog Coin inside. The Treasure Box you are
standing on has a Flower in it, but you will have to drop down to get it which
means backtracking back to this room after. Head up to the next room. Read the
note on the door, Mallow's parents are inside. After Bowser tries to ram the
door down head up to the next room. Fight the Heavy Troopa then go in the next
room, after breaking in on Valentina's meeting with Dodo And Shy Away. Head up
to the next room and save, switch Bowser with Princes and put him in the middle
slot. Keep heading up through the passages defeating Blue Birds until you see
a shadow on the floor, stand on he shadow and jump to uncover a hidden platform
then jump on the platform and jump again to hit the Box and you will get a
"Invincibility Star". So quickly run ahead into the Blue Birds, Dodo the off
the edge of the castle. Once you land near the hot spring guards jump on the
trampoline, then heal everyone with HP Rain (especially Boweser). Then jump on
the trampoline and you will catch up to Valentina who is being held back by
the locals, you will fight her and Dodo now...

-----------------------------------------------
 DODO: 1000 HP "I'm starved...later!"
 VALENTINA: 2000 HP "I tell ya, he's NOTHING!"
-----------------------------------------------
As the battle begins Dodo picks up the middle character (which should be
Bowser)and takes them to a One on One battle. If you use Poison Gas for the
first turn then use the Spiked Link after that you should cause heaps of
damage, also defend his beak attacks (press B when he pecks you) you should
make him fly away in no time. Now it goes to the battle between Valentina and
the other two, use physical attacks until Bowser and Dodo come back. Then get
Mario and Bowser to use physical attacks on Valentina while Mallow heals and
uses items. Eventually they will fly away giving you 54 Ex.pts and 200 Coins.
-----------------------------------------------

After Valentina flies away a Key lands on Mallow, Mallow uses the key and is
re-united with his parents. After the gang have a chat, King Nimbus will tell
you that a Star fell into the Volcano. Now head down and go in the room King
& Queen Nimbus were being held in and talk to the guard, he will give you a
Flower Jar. Now head down to the room with 3 doors that was before Birdo, jump
in the top left corner near the bird cage and you will uncover a Surprise Box
with a Frog Coin inside. Now exit the castle and head into the house in the top
right corner of Nimbus Land. You will find Croco inside, so talk to him and he
will run out leaving the Signal Ring behind. So pick it up and exit the house,
now walk directly down (screen wise) and follow he hidden path to the Shy Away,
talk to the Shy Away and he/she will give you the Fertilizer. Now go down the
hole and jump on the warp trampoline to exit Nimbus Land, then go to Rose Town.
 _________
|Rose Town|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Head up into the newly opened section and enter the house. Talk to the Gardener
inside and give him the Seed and Fertilizer, he will plant the seed and use the
fertilizer making a giant beanstalk grow. Exit the house and climb the crates
to get to the beanstalk, Mario will climb it to the clouds, hit the two
Treasure Boxes to get the Lazy Shell Armour and Weapon. So go back down the
beanstalk then down and into Gaz's House have a rest, save, then exit and go to
the Nimbus Land.
 ___________
|Nimbus Land|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Go down the top hole and talk to the guards, head right then jump in the Hot
Spring to fully recover. Then head down into the Barrel Volcano.
 ______________
|Barrel Volcano|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Some words of advice for this section: attack the Corkpedites body and use weak
magic attacks to defeat Vomer. Switch Bowser for Princess the walk down to the
next section. There are some small stepping stones below, follow them to the
secret section. Hit the boxes for two Flowers then exit and jump back across
the stones. Climb the rocks on left to go up to the next section. Climb up to
the next section but avoid the Vomer. Hit the Treasure Box in the next section
for a Flower, then head up and hit the next box for loads of coins. Head to
the next section. Hit the box for an "Invincibility Star" and quickly run
ahead, climb up, then run into the Corkpedite, the star usually runs out around
now. Head left to the next section. Head up past the Vomers to the next
section. Walk to the left of the lava pool and take a running jump to collect
the Frog Coin, then head up to the next section. Jump across the stepping
stones to the nest section, but be careful and time your jumps if you want to
avoid fighting the Pyrospheres. Go back through the doorway then jump on the
lava, you will fly up to the Frog Coin. Now go back into the next section.
Jump up the Donut blocks to get to the first Frog Coin, then walk around and
jump up to collect the other Frog Coin, now head to the next section. Quickly
run left to the next section while avoiding  the Magmus the Stumpet shots out
at you. Hit the Box to get a Flower then climb up and hit the other box for
a Frog Coin, save then head up to the next section. Defeat the Stumpet then
head around to the next section. Climb up carefully then head down to the next
section. Climb up and fight the Corkpedite, then head left to the next section
(are you sick of me saying that yet..) Defeat another Stumpet then head to the
next section. Climb up the rocks then hit the box for some coins and talk to
the weird looking mushroom person (His name is Hinopio) to enter his Hino Mart.
The first store sells items, here is a list:

Mid Mushroom | 20
Maple Syrup  | 30
Pick Me Up   |  5
Able Juice   |  4
Freshen Up   | 50

The second stall lets you rest for 30 Coins. And the final stall sells you
armour. Buy all the Fire armour and equip it all. Here is a useless list:

Fire Shirt | 90
Fire Pants | 90
Fire Cape  | 90
Fire Shell | 90
Fire Dress | 90

Once your finished head out of the door to the right. Now save and head up,
make your way across the Donut bridge very carefully to the next section were
you fight...

--------------------------------------------------
 CZAR DRAGON: 1400 HP "Flamin' hot, right at ya!"
 ZOMBONE: 1800 HP "Hey! We're not done yet!"
--------------------------------------------------
Get Mario to use physical attacks, Mallow to use Snowy & Toadstool to use
physical attacks when she is not using Group Hug or items. When Czar is down he
will resurrect himself as Zombone. Use the same strategy on Zombone except use
Shocker instead of Snowy. Once he is down you get 50 Ex.Pts.
--------------------------------------------------

Now Zombone is defeated. Head up to the next section, you are about to get the
Red Star but the Axem Rangers swipe it. Chase them all the way out of the
Barrel Volcano, then you must fight them on their huge ship called Blade.

Go, go, Axem Rangers!

--------------------------------------------
 AXEM PINK: 400 HP "Red, WRONG POSITION!"
 AXEM BLACK: 550 HP "You're timing stinks!"
 AXEM RED: 800 HP "I'm all thumbs today."
 AXEM YELLOW: 600 HP "We're lookin' GOOD!"
 AXEM GREEN: 450 HP "Are we done here?"
 AXEM RANGERS: 999 HP "It's a melee!"
--------------------------------------------
The best strategy is to bring them down one by one, while Toadstool heals
periodically. Firstly go for Axem Pink using physical attacks, her healing
special is too much of a threat. Once she is down go for Axem Black, Mario &
Toastool should use physical attacks while Mallow uses Shocker. Then go for
Axem Green, do the same as you did for Black but use Snowy instead of Shocker.
Then go for Axem Yellow Mario should use Super Jump on him while the other
attack physically. Finally take out Axem Red by using the same modus operandi
as Axem Green. Once they are all down the will form up as Axem Rangers which
uses the disastrous Breaker Beam every three or so turns. Get Toastool to use
Group Hug every time the Beam is discharged and attack using Shocker and
phyical attacks. Eventually they will submit, giving you a whopping 17 Ex.Pts.
--------------------------------------------

Blade crashes into the background and Mario is awarded the Red Star.

    ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
    ~ 6 Star Pieces have finally        ~
    ~ been collected. Where could that  ~
    ~ last Star Piece be?               ~
    ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Now go into the Castle and talk to Mallows parents, they will let you use the
Royal Bus. So now exit the castle and head left to the Royal Bus Station and
talk to the engineer. You will now get a lift to Bowser's Keep.
 _____________
|Bowser's Keep|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Firstly switch Mallow with Bowser, as he will make some of the more annoying
enemies run away. Head up to the room where you fought Bowser at the very
start of the game, the bridge that fell down has been replaced by Donut Blocks.
Now head up to a very dark room, navigate your way through the darkness to the
next section (there is a Box with a "Recovery Mushroom" in there somewhere).
The next room has Croco, but he is making himself useful by selling hot gear,
head through the doorway in the bottom left corner first as there are two
Treasure Boxes with 150 Coins and a "Recovery Mushroom", then go and talk to
Croco here is his inventory:

Mid Mushroom | 20
Maple Syrup  | 30
Pick Me Up   |  5
Freshen Up   | 50
Fire Shirt   | 90
Fire Pants   | 90
Fire Cape    | 90
Fire Shell   | 90
Fire Dress   | 90

Now head up to the next room, This contain the 6 Doors (see Section 6 for info
on clearing this part). Once you have completed 4 Courses head right to the
next room, you will drop down into a room with a Save Box, so save then head up
where you will fight...

--------------------------------------------
 MAGIKOOPA: 1600 HP "That's...my child?"
 he summons these with his magic:
 JINX CLONE: 320 HP "I'm the REAL thing!"
 KING BOMB: 500 HP "I LIVE to explode!"
 BAHAMUTT: 500 HP "Give me a chance, here."
--------------------------------------------
It's not so much Magikoopa that will cause you trouble here, it's the monsters
he summons. Get everyone to use physical attacks on him while Toadstool heals,
just keeping attacking him and his monsters until you nock enough sense into
him, you get around 10 Ex.pts and Coins for your victory.
--------------------------------------------

After Magikoopa turns back to his proper blue colour and Bowser & him
reminisce. He will produce a Magic Tresure Box that never runs out of coins,
talk to him to be rejuvenated fully. Now go in the door on the left, inside
Croco is selling more goods buy all the special armour and equip it, here is a
list:

Mid Mushroom |  20
Maple Syrup  |  30
Pick Me Up   |   5
Freshen Up   |  50
Hero Shirt   | 100
Prince Pants | 100
Star Cape    | 100
Heal Shell   | 100
Royal Dress  | 100

Once your finished exit and go through the right door, in this room simply run
up while avoiding Thwomps and fighting Big Berthas to the next room. Walk up
in the next room to fight Boomer on the Chandeliers.

----------------------------------------
 BOOMER: 2000 HP "It's all over now..."
----------------------------------------
He is a cinch, just use physical attacks when he is blue in colour and use
special attacks when he is red in colour. Toadstool should be the designated
healer as per usual. You get around 19 Ex.pts and 9 Coins for beating Boomer.
----------------------------------------

Now the Chandeli-Ho will take you to the top of Bowser's Keep, where you will
fight...

-------------------------------------------
 EXOR: 1800 "Gotta mow the lawn soon."
 LEFT EYE: 300 "I can't see a thing!"
 NEOSQUID: 800 "I'm so utterly alone..."
 RIGHT EYE: 500 "I've got an astigmatism!"
-------------------------------------------
Get Toadstool to heal nearly every turn, Bowser should attack Neosquid while
Mario uses Ultra Jump. Once at least one of the eyes has been taken out, attack
Exor with a bombardment of physical attacks. If the eyes wake up again quickly
use Mario's Ultra Jump, Bowser's Bowser Crush & Toastool's Psych Bomb.
Once Exor is defeated you will get 34 Ex.Pts then you will be sucked into his
mouth with a wall of fire.
-------------------------------------------

Exor's mouth leads to the Gate.

|Gate|
 ¯¯¯¯
NOTE: To find out what you should get in preperation for Smithy, please scroll
      to the end of this sub-section.

Firstly switch Bowser with Geno. Head upwards into the next section, jump on
the nut repetitively while facing right it will spin across the bolt to the
other side. Now jump of, save & then head up to the next section. Make your way
across more bolts to the next section. Fight the Ameboids then jump on the
switch and head up to the next section. Save then jump in the bottom left
corner to uncover a Surprise Box with a "Recovery Mushroom" inside. Continue to
the next section, hit the Box to get the "Ultra Hammer" (The Lazy Shell is
stronger). Then jump on the trampoline and make your way across the bolts, jump
on the trampoline and walk up to the giant clock, which will start a battle.

----------------------------------------------------
 DING-A-LING: 1200  Factory "Wake up sleepy heads!"
 COUNT DOWN: 2400  Factory "We're into overtime!"
 DING-A-LING: 1200  Factory "Wake up sleepy heads!"
----------------------------------------------------
You should take out Count Down first as it is the biggest threat, get everyone
to use physical attacks while Princess uses Group Hug. Once it is out of order
take out the Ding-a-lings (sounds rude) the same way. You get 67 Ex.pts and 100
Coins for defeating them.
----------------------------------------------------

Now save and jump on the trampoline. Head up and jump on the conveyor belt and
hit the box to get a "Recovery Mushroom" , then drop down onto the white slate
platform and walk onto the next platform when they meet, then jump off onto
the conveyor belt when you get close (it doesn't matter if you jump off as you
will land, into a secret section just head up and hit the boxes for a Flower
and a "Recovery Mushroom"), Anyway head up to the next section. Run past the
conveyor belts spewing out a constant stream of enemies and head up to the
next section. Follow the conveyor belts and the path to a Treasure Box, hit it
to get a Royal Syrup. Head down on the conveyor belt and jump on the white
slate platform, jump off to the next conveyor belt when it gets close. Head
left and hit the Treasure Box for a Max Mushroom, then head up to the next
section. Make your way up the conveyor belt stairs fighting machine made
Bowyers on the way up. Follow the path to another set of conveyor belt
stairs, scale them then head up to the next section and save. Head up again,
ignore the enemies and head to the top left corner into a small section with
two boxes containing a Flower and a "Recovery Mushroom". Head back and fight
the machine made Yaridovich, after defeating him the grey brick block that was
blocking the hole explodes. Jump down and you will fight...

--------------------------------------------
 CLOAKER: 1200 HP "I love cold hard steel!"
 DOMINO: 900 HP "MAGIC! DEAL with it!"
 and either...
 EARTH LINK: 2500 HP "What a royal pain!"
 or
 MAD ADDER: 1500 HP "I'm alive and kicking.
--------------------------------------------
If you defeat Cloaker first you will fight Domino riding Mad Adder & if you
defeat Domino first you will fight Cloaker riding Earth Link. I personally
think you should defeat Cloaker first (use physical attacks while Toadstool
heals). Then attack Mad Adder (don't bother attacking Domino) until he is
defeated and you get around 40 Ex.pts.
--------------------------------------------

Now head left into the Factory.
 _______
|Factory|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Head up and dispose of the Mad Mallets the Clerk sicks on you, then fight him:

------------------------------------------
 CLERK: 500 HP "10 years I've been here!"
 MAD MALLET: 200 HP "Work, work, work..."
 MAD MALLET: 200 HP "Work, work, work..."
------------------------------------------
Extremely easy, just take out the Clerk with physical attacks then if the Mad
Mallets don't run off take them also out with physical attacks. You get 24
Ex.pts and 21 Coins for defeating him.
------------------------------------------

After Mario saves Mallow from the crane head up.. Toad will suddenly appear
stocked to the eyeballs with goods (~_~ opportunist) here is his inventory:

Mid Mushroom  | 10
Max Mushroom  | 39
Maple Syrup   | 15
Pick Me Up    |  3

 POUNDER: 180 HP "Wham bam SLAM!"
 POUNDER: 180 HP "Wham bam SLAM!"
 POUNDER: 180 HP "Wham bam SLAM!"
----------------------------------------------
Use the same method as Clerk and his Mad Mallets. You get 41 Ex.pts and 46
Coins for defeating him.
----------------------------------------------

Then head up and fight the Director..

---------------------------------------------
 DIRECTOR: 1000 HP "I just lost EVERYTHING."
 POUNDETTE: 150 HP "Love conquers ALL."
---------------------------------------------
Use the same modus operandi as the last two, you may have to heal if you suck.
You get 61 Ex.pts and 92 Coins for defeating him.
---------------------------------------------

Now head up and save, then head up to the next room to fight...

-------------------------------------------------------
 FACTORY CHIEF: 1000 HP "Who DARES to fight ME?!"
 GUNYOLK: 1500 HP "If we're beaten, the boss is alone!
-------------------------------------------------------
As soon as you begin get Geno to cast Geno Boost on Mario & Toadstool to cast
Mute onto Gunyolk (this will prevent the Breaker Beam). Now use physical
attacks on them while Toadstool heals and eventually they will be defeated,
giving you 60 Ex.pts and 100 Coins.
-------------------------------------------------------

Now head back down and save, now for some preparation.
You should have these Items: 4×Max Mushrooms, 4×Royal Syrups, 3×Crystalline,
3×Power Blast, 4×Pick Me Up, 4×Kerokero Cola & the Star Egg.
And your party should be equipped like so:
Mario     - Lazy Shell, Super Suit or Hero Shirt & the Attack Scarf.
Geno      - Star Gun, Star Cape & the Scrooge Ring.
Toadstool - Frying Pan, Royal Dress & the Safety Ring.

then head up and jump on the switch to fight Smithy...

---------------------------------------------
 SMITHY: 2000 HP "Eh?! Not bad!"
 SMELTER: 1500 HP "I brush after each meal!"
 who produces on mass:
 SHYPER: 400 HP "Ooh! This'll be fun!"
---------------------------------------------
Okay! The penultimate battle! Okay start off buy using Crystalline & Power
Blast. Now get Mario to use the Lazy Shell on Smelter while Geno uses his
Geno Blast special and Toadstool attacks the Smelter with her Frying Pan (while
using Group Hug when needed). When Smelter is down get everyone to use physical
attacks on Smithy. You know this battle is finished when Aero & Drill Bit jump
down to calm Smithy down, which aggravates him more.
---------------------------------------------

So he bangs the ground so hard the floor gives way and everyone falls down to
an ominous landscapem were you have the ultimate battle against Smithy's true
form a metamorphosing, chrome plated, cyborg, mean, bastard of a blacksmith.

-------------------------------------------------------------
 SMITHY: 8000 HP > Default Head - "This isn't good at all!"
                   Tank Head    - "Don't shock me! DON'T!"
                   Magic Head   - "Good magic, bad defense."
                   Vault Head   - "Nothin' can hurt me!"
                   Box Head     - "What's hidden inside?!"
 SMITHY: 1000 HP "What a heavy head!"
-------------------------------------------------------------
Smithy's head changes constantly (It's a bit annoying). Just get Mario to use
the Lazy Shell, Geno to use Geno Flash and Toadstool should use items and Group
Hug when needed, but she should also use the Frying Pan when she is free. Also
Mario should use Ultra Flame if his head is the Treasure Box. After a while he
will die and the final star will be Mario's.
-------------------------------------------------------------

NOW WATCH THE HAPPY LITTLE ENDING! ^_^

|The Super Jump Record|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Type: Side-Quest
Reward(s): Attack Scarf & Super Suit.

Once you do 30 or more jumps in a row using the Super Jump go and talk to the
Chow in Monstro Town, he will give you the Attack Scarf. Also if you do 100
jumps in a row see him again to get the Super Suit. Getting the Super Suit is
*THE* most challenging thing in the game. For tips on super jumping, I suggest
you look at "Rotaj Russell's Guide to Super Jumping FAQ" that can be viewed at
GameFAQ's. His FAQ goes more in-depth then I could/would ever go on the subject
of Super Jumping.

|Midas River|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Type: Mini-Game
Reward(s): Frog Coins & Flowers

SPECIAL CONTROLS: Control Pad- Move left & right in the Rapids Course
                  B Button- · Swim against current in the Rapids
                            · Jump during Barrel Jumping Event

COST: The trampoline costs 30 Coins to use.

RAPIDS COURSE:
You start from "START" if your coming from the Kero Sewers or the trampoline,
you start from the "ALT*START" if your coming from the bucket in Moleville.
The biggest mistake people make in the Midas River Course is tapping the B
button really fast, this may make you journey faster but it makes it much
harder. You can manoeuvre from one side of the river to the other quite easily
by hitting the button at about 3 strokes per 2 seconds. The only time you
should tap the button really fast is when you are trying to scale up the bank
from the other side of a fork. For example take the first fork in the river,
the only way to get the coin that is just down the right stream of the fork is
to drop down and get it, then stroke slowly to the left to get to the bank,
then tap "B" furiously while holding left so you can scale the bank to get to
the left stream of the fork. Look below for a Map and the grotto guide.

GROTTO GUIDE:
You can only get the items from a grotto once.
Cave A takes you through a grotto with many monsters playing, but nothing
happens to Mario. You emerge from this grotto at point 1.
Cave B takes you into a grotto were a Sky Troopa & a Crook are fighting over
a flower, but Mario gets the Flower in the end. You emerge from this grotto
at point 2.
Cave C takes you to a grotto were Mario gets forked by a Forkie and loses
coins. You emerge from this grotto at point 3.
Cave D takes you to a grotto were a Lakitu is fishing and a Goombette retrieves
a fish for their Goomba family. Mario gets a Frog Coin in this grotto and he
emerges at point 4.
Cave E takes you to a grotto were a Crook is being harassed by Thwomps, you get
a Flower in this grotto and you emerge at point 5.

BARREL JUMPING EVENT:
The Barrel Jumping Event is quite easy. Just bump into the first barrel, then
jump to the second, then jump to the third, then bump in the fourth & repeat.
So in other words: Bump, Jump, Jump, Bump, Bump, Jump, Jump, Bump, Bump, Jump,
Jump, Bump, Bump, Jump & Jump. Watch out for fish as you will lose coins if you
get hit by them.

EXCHANGE RATES:
At the end of the Midas River the operator will swap you Frog Coin(s) for how
many coins you collected, any coins that are not exchanged for Frog Coins are
kept by him and will be added to how many coins you collect next time you try
the Midas River Course. The exchange rates are related to how many coins you
collect on your way down. Except the first time you go down were it is always
1 Frog Coin for 60 coins. The exchange rates are as follows:

    > 69 Coins = 1 Per 80 Coins
 70 - 79 Coins = 1 Per 75 Coins
 80 - 89 Coins = 1 Per 70 Coins
 90 - 99 Coins = 1 Per 60 Coins
     100 Coins = 1 Per 50 Coins

|Goomba Thumpin' Mini-Game|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Type: Mini-Game
Reward(s): Frog Coins & Flower Products

RULES:
This Mini-Game cost 10 coins to play. In it you have to jump on as many Goombas
as possible, you get 1 point for jumping on a Goomba, 3 for jumping on a Gold
Goomba and you lose 1 point for jumping on a Spikey. You get 30 seconds to
get more then the goal, and if you get more then the goal 2 more then your
score becomes the next goal.

STRATEGY:
The best idea is to stay in the middle and try to do as many multiple bounces
as possible, to do this hold "Y" and manoeuvre so after jumping on one Goomba
you land on the next. This is easiest between the top pipe and the bottom pipe.
To get as many prizes as possible never get more then the Goal, match it
instead. The goal starts at 20 points, so you match the 2O pts and you'll get a
Flower Tab and the new Goal will be 22 points. Then you'll match the 22 pts and
you'll get a Flower Jar and the new Goal will be 24 point. Now continue with
the strategy (all prizes after this are Frog Coins).

|Mushroom Derby|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Type: Mini-Game
Reward(s): Yoshi Cookies

STARTING THE RACE / BETING:
Well to play you need Yoshi Cookies, if you don't have any Yoshi Cookies talk
to the Red Yoshi that is between the two huts on the left side of the race
track. Then go talk to Boshi and select that you want to race. Now he will
tell you Yoshi's odds, then you can select either to race Yoshi (compete) or
watch Yoshi (leave up to chance), then he will ask you how much you want to
wager. The Wager determines how much you will be payed off according to Yoshi's
odds but it also determines how much you will lose if Yoshi doesn't win.
For Example, If Yoshi's odds are 2:1 and you wagered 3 Cookies, the payoff is
calculated by 2×3 which of course equals 6, pretty easy huh?

RACING:
Winning the race is basically down to rhythm, The best technique is to hold
the controller so you hold it kind of like a GameBoy (think of the Control Pad
as the GameBoy's screen), just cradle the button end of the Controller with
your hands and rest your left thumb on the B Button and your right thumb on the
A Button. Now press the two buttons alternatively to the rhythm of the cymbals
in the background of the music. If you think you will panic if your losing
don't look at the screen, as it will put your rhythm off indefinitely.

|Knife Guy's Juggling Game|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Type: Mini-Game
Reward(s): Mushrooms, Wilt Shrooms, Rotten Mushes, Moldy Mushes, Max Mushrooms
           & the Bright Card.

LOCATED:
After saving Toadstool go into Booster Tower and head up until you find Knife
Guy, talk to him to play his Juggling Game.

RULES:
Knife Guy juggles balls at a random speed for a random amount of time, once he
finishes you have to walk at which hand the yellow ball lands in. He awards you
Wilt Shrooms first, then when you get better he awards you Rotten Mushes, then
Moldy Mushes. If win enough he will award you the Bright Card & Max Mushrooms.

STRATEGY:
My strategy is not to follow the yellow ball as you will most likely lose it.
This best idea is to stare blankly at the screen focused on Knife Guy's head so
that your eyes only detect the movement of the balls, it seems easier this way
to judge which hand it lands in. Don't ask me why!
 ____________
|Beetle Mania|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Type: Mini-Game
Reward(s): Nada, Zip, Zilch & Nothing!

HOW TO PLAY:
You control a small beetle that shoots stars when you press "A", the aim of the
game is to shoot Koopa shells for points. Then when they explode stars fly out
from them, if these stars hit another Koopa shell it will explode, thus
creating a chain reaction. Each time this happens the points you get from
exploding them doubles. So it goes from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 to 16 to 32 ect. Also
every time you get about 15,000 points, a heart will fall down. If you grab
this heart it will be easier for you to regenerate after being hit by a Koopa
shell or star, To regenerate tap "A" furiously.

BACKGROUNDS:
If Geno or Princess are the 1st ally in your party it will be Clouds.
If Bowser or Mallow are the 1st ally in your party it will be a forest level
from Super Mario World.
 ___________
|Beetle Race|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Type: Mini-Game
Reward(s): Coins & Frog Coins

HOW TO START:
After defeating Yaridovich go into the bottom left store in Seaside Town, this
is Beetles Are Us and it is the office for Beetle Racing on Booster Hill.
The initiation fee is 100 Coins then for every time you rent a Beetle Box it's
an extra 50 Coins. Buy a Beetle box then go to Booster Hill to compete in
Beetle Racing.

STRATEGY:
Simply jump on as many barrels as you can to get a boost forward, you will have
to time your jumps by using the sound the barrel makes when you get close to
the edge of the screen. When the Snifits start running ahead jump on them for a
boost forward too. And finally, only jump when you are either jumping on
something to get a boost or collecting a beetle. As jumping slows you down
marginally.

TRADING IN:
After you collect some beetles head back to Beetles Are Us and talk to the
snifit inside. He will trade you Coins, for the amount and type of beetles as
follows:

Male   (Large) - 50 Coins
Female (Small) -  1 Coin
Golden (Gold!) -  1 Frog Coin
 __________
|Sky Bridge|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Type: Mini-Game
Reward(s): Coins & Frog Coins

COST: 5 Coins to play

SPECIAL CONTROLS: B Button: Jump on spot
                  B Button + Left: Jump to next Donut Block

DIFFICULTY LEVELS:
Normal: Uses special controls. 5 Coins for completion.
Special: Uses special controls & Donut Blocks fall. 8 Coins for completion.

block. On the Special & Expert Courses jump on the spot to prevent the Donut
Blocks from falling. If you make it over once the Shamen will give you the
chance of doubling your prize, but you will have to go over the course again
and the bullets fires in a more acqward sequence. You can double your prize
twice so that means 20 Coins on the Normal Course, 32 Coins on the Special
Course & 4 Frog Coins on the Expert Course.

Coin inside. After the Chow in the top left corner of this section jump to
uncover a Surprise Box with a Frog Coin inside. Now head to the next section,
make you way through the cave and after a barrel drops down jump down, hit the
Treasure Box for a "Recovery Mushroom" & then jump on the trampoline. Now

|The Battle with Culex|
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Type: Side-Quest
Reward(s): Quartz Charm

OPENING THE SEALED DOOR:
Go to Moleville and enter house in the top left corner of town, Now talk to the
man mole in the corner (His name was Docherty in the beta version) and buy some
fireworks off him for 500 Coins. Now exit, head to the right and talk to the
little girl mole by the crates, swap the Fireworks for the Shiny Stone. Now
go to Monstro Town and press "A" at the sealed door to open it. Now enter to
fight Culex.

DEFEATING CULEX AND HIS CRYSTALS:
--------------------------------------------------
 CULEX: 4096 HP "A little off, eh?"
 FIRE CRYSTAL: 2500 HP "I gotta vacuum tonight!
 WATER CRYSTAL: 1600 HP "Get me back underground!
 EARTH CRYSTAL: 3200 HP "I hate being awakened!"
 WIND CRYSTAL: 800 HP "Whhhhhhooooo...
--------------------------------------------------
You will need the Lazy Shell, the Safety Ring, the Star Egg, around 3 Maple
Syrups & some Energizers. Now have Geno & Toadstool in your team and equip the
Lazy Shell and Safety Ring on Toadstool, this will make her almost impenetrable
to all of their attacks (But Culex's physical attack & Dark Star will still
take out a fair whack). Now as soon as the battle starts get Geno to cast Geno
Boost on the Princess. Now get Geno and Mario to attack Culex with physical
attacks until they die, when this happens don't revive them. The basic idea is
to get Princess to use the Star Egg constantly for 150 HP worth of damage on
all enemies. She will also need to use Therapy when her HP gets low, Maple
Syrups when her FP gets low & Energizer whenever Culex casts Shredder to keep
the damage caused by the Star Egg to 150 HP. Eventually the crystals will die
or run out of FP, if all enemies on screen run out of FP use "Come Back" on
Mario & Geno and get them to join in using the "Star Egg" as well. Once they
are all defeated you get 244 Ex.pts and the Quartz Charm. With this strategy it
is possible to beat them at Level 15, but Level 20 is far more safer.

Next is Barrel Counting, simply count the first and second set of barrels to
continue. There is a trick to this section but you must have good eyes, the
first room has a default amount of 12 barrels and the second room has a default
amount of 43 barrels. So all you have to do is count the slightly lighter
looking barrels (Dr. Tooper has added) then add them to the default amounts to
get the answer (you do need good eyes though!). Now the next section has a
riddle thingy, if you have trouble with it here is the answer:

After talking to Dr. Tooper,
Talk to the monster that says "I outrode ...." first,
then talk to the monster that says "I placed fourth ....",
then talk to the monster that says "I placed the same ....",
then finally talk to the monster that says "I placed third ...."

Then hit the Treasure Box in the next room to get "Rock Candy".

This course starts off with the "Coin Collecting" game, in it Mario and Dr.
Topper take turns at getting coins from a Treasure Box. In each turn you must
take between 1 and 4 coins, the person who collects the 21st coin wins. The
best strategy is to take the 15th coin then after Dr. Topper has his go collect
up to the 20th Coin and stop, he will now get the 21st Coin.
Next it's the "Magic Buttons" here is a diagram of the buttons:

           1
         5   2
       9   6   3
    13  10   7   4
      14  11   8
        15  12
          16

Jump on the buttons 2, 8, 9 & 15 or 3, 5, 12 & 14 to clear the room.
Now it's "Ball Solitaire" the solution uses the same diagram as the "Magic
Buttons":

 1) Kick the ball on 1 over the ball on 2,
 2) kick the ball on 9 over the ball on 5,
 3) kick the ball on 10 over the ball on 6,
 4) kick the ball on 12 over the ball on 11,
 5) kick the ball on 14 over the ball on 10,
 6) kick the ball on 16 over the ball on 15,
 7) kick the ball on 13 over the ball on 14,
 8) kick the ball on 3 over the ball on 7,
 9) kick the ball on 15 over the ball on 11,
10) kick the ball on 1 over the ball on 2,
11) kick the ball on 4 over the ball on 8,
12) kick the ball on 6 over the ball on 7,
13) kick the ball on 12 over the ball on 8 &
