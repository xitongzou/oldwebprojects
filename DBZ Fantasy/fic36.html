Chapter 1</H3>

<P>Her name was Maladia.  She was smart, funny, and brave.  She was also the
third most powerfull being on Earth.  As Guru's only daughter she had allot
of pressure put on her.  The only female Namek in the entire universe, and
she fell in love with Piccolo.  Piccolo tried to keep her safe and
unnoticed, but now he had no choice but to tell everyone about his greatest
love.  She was expecting the first naturally born two parent Namek in over
1000 years.  Piccolo took her to Master Roshi's to introduce her to the rest
of the Z fighters.

<P>Who is this?  Yamcha said mockingly.

<P>My greatest love.  Do you have a problem with her?  Piccolo said gruffly

<P>Uhh.. no, she is great.  Yamcha stuttered.

<P>She is beautiful Piccolo.  Gohan said.   Is she going to have a baby?

<P>Yes.  Maladia said.  I am.  Piccolo's baby will grow to be a great warrior
like both of us.

<P>You are a warrior?  Asked Krillin.

<P>Yes I am.  After I have this baby I will be fighting with you.  Piccolo said
I should be careful while I am pregnant and I agree, but after it is born I
will be a force to be reckoned with.  Maladia's face curled into a scowl as
she said the words.

<P>A few months later:

<P>Piccolo and Maladia's son Astor was born.  He was a strong and smart baby.
He grew in the next year and would soon be old enough to begin training.
The Androids came a few months later and Piccolo and the rest of the Z
fighters got ready.  Maladia wouldnt take no for an answer, she left Astor
with Chi Chi and she went off with the men.  Maladia was strong and held her
own in the fight, but in the end she was no better off than the rest.  She
did her special attack, The energy wave attack,  this attack vaporizes one
of the androids and saps all of her energy.  She is laying on the ground
defenseless.  The other Z fighters all around her are in the same shape, all
tapped out.  Krillin's destructo disk, Piccolo's Special Beam Cannon, and
Gohan's Masenco all were usefull and helpfull, but only put a dent in the
other androids.  They were all about to perish and then........
