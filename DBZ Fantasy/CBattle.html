       Cell Saga</p>
      <p>150. Piccolo vs. Cell</p>
      <p>Piccolo faced up to the newly revealed monster with his newly found powers, 
        ready for a colossal showdown. The two battled hard, but it was clear 
        that the super Namek was by far superior in terms of power, destroying 
        Cell even though he had his weighted clothes on. Cell managed to gain 
        a slight advantage when he absorbed Piccolo's arm, causing the Namek great 
        pain. It turned out it was done purposely by Piccolo to find out about 
        Cell's origins though, as the Namek just regenerated the injury.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>151. Army vs. Cell</p>
      <p>The army arrive to see Cell having the upper hand on Piccolo, and rain 
        down an array of awesome firepower on him, but to no affect. Cell easily 
        destroys them all, then moves his attention back to the Namek.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>152. Cell vs. Piccolo, Krillen, Tien, and Trunks</p>
      <p>Piccolo has been beating up Cell a little more when his friends arrive 
        to give their unnecessary assistance. With Piccolo temporarily distracted, 
        Cell takes utmost advantage, flying up into the air and using a devastating 
        solar flare, blinding everyone with the Sun's brilliant white light. With 
        the excellent opportunity presenting itself, Cell escaped to try and absorb 
        some people and gain more power.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>153. Cell vs. People</p>
      <p>Cell ventured into a small town, and despite the resistance, he crushed 
        everyone, absorbing them into himself and increasing his power. With his 
        ability to hide and sense KI, he was able to escape whenever the Z soldiers 
        neared, giving him a huge advantage over them.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>154. Cell vs. Girl and Boy</p>
      <p>Cell went into a small room after having absorbed everybody in the whole 
        area, able to sense a small KI signature of a young girl, and even younger 
        boy. He kicks over the table which they were hiding under, and chases 
        them all the way outside.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>155. Krillen vs. Cell</p>
      <p>Krillen is flying around, hoping not to spot Cell when he notices the 
        girl and boy running from something, before seeing Cell coming out of 
        the building. He floated down, thoroughly regretting his decision to fight, 
        and battled Cell, with him being the obvious loser, managing to get a 
        few good shots in, but not enough to injure his opponent. Just when it 
        looked like Krillen was going to die, Piccolo and Tien arrived, making 
        Cell flee once more. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>156. Piccolo vs. #17</p>
      <p>This was arguably the best fight in the whole of the series, with both 
        warriors equally matched in terms of strength. It went back and forth 
        with an awesome variety of techniques and skills from the two, with Piccolo 
        rapidly getting worn down whilst #17 stayed fresh with his infinite energy. 
        Before either of them could gain victory, the fight was interrupted by 
        an unwanted visitor.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>157. Cell vs. Piccolo</p>
      <p>Piccolo saw Cell and immediately attacked, not allowing him to absorb 
        17, but was defeated effortlessly due to Cell's newly found power. He 
        had his neck broken with an incredible feat of strength, before being 
        tossed into the water.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>158. Cell vs. #17</p>
      <p>Seeing the supposed death of Piccolo, 17 charged right in at Cell, his 
        efforts just as futile as Piccolo's, as he was unable to get a shot in, 
        before getting pummeled into the ground. Just as it looked as though Cell 
        was about the absorb the helpless Android, yet another interference commenced.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>159. #16 vs. Cell</p>
      <p>The silent giant tapped Cell on the shoulder, then delivered a powerful 
        punch, sending the malicious fiend flying backwards, before following 
        it through with a manner of attacks, really sending Cell onto the ropes. 
        He then slammed him deep into the ground with an incredible attack, with 
        the fight seemingly over.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>160. Cell vs. #17</p>
      <p>17 began to get cocky, expecting that Cell has been defeated by his ally, 
        only to have the beast float up behind him after burying under ground 
        out of sight, and attempt to absorb him. #17 fought valiantly, but eventually 
        had to give in to the behemoths might, becoming part of Cell, and allowing 
        him to go to his second stage.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>161. Imperfect Cell vs. #16</p>
      <p>After seeing how much more powerful Cell has become, 16 charged in, only 
        to be batted right down with a huge chunk being hit out of his head. Cell 
        then diverted his attentions to #18.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>162. Imperfect Cell vs. #18</p>
      <p>18 saw Cell advancing on her, and firing her most powerful energy balls, 
        only to have Cell take them full on, and emerge unharmed. He widened his 
        tail, ready to absorb #18, when an unexpected visitor interfered.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>163. Tien vs. Imperfect Cell</p>
      <p>Tien unleashed wave after wave of his most powerful attack, the Kikoho 
        (Tri Beam), keeping Cell at bay, although he wasn't causing him any damage. 
        During this time #18 and #16 managed to escape, with Tien collapsing due 
        to lack of energy, and letting Cell pursue, although it was too late for 
        him to find them.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>164. Goku vs. Imperfect Cell</p>
      <p>Goku could take no more of being a spectator, and teleported to the battlefield, 
        picking up Tien and Piccolo (finding out the Namek was alive by a feint 
        power signature), then threatened that he would beat Cell in just a few 
        days time. Cell then tried to attack him, but before he could land a punch, 
        Goku teleported away.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>165. Vegeta vs. Imperfect Cell</p>
      <p>Vegeta came out of the room of spirit and time and confronted Cell, easily 
        defeating him with his newly found super powers. After much whining though, 
        Cell convinced Vegeta to let him find and absorb #18 so he would become 
        more powerful.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>166. Imperfect Cell vs. Trunks</p>
      <p>Trunks refused to allow Cell to pass and absorb #18, opting instead to 
        fight him, proving that he was just as powerful as Vegeta by giving Cell 
        a beating. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>167. Vegeta vs. Trunks</p>
      <p>Annoyed at his son interfering, Vegeta went over to Trunks and beat him 
        back, allowing Cell to go and absorb #18. Trunks refused to be pushed 
        around though, blasting Vegeta miles back with an awesome beam.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>168. Imperfect Cell vs. #16, Krillen, and #18</p>
      <p>Imperfect Cell used a solar flare in order to make his job easier, before 
        easily defeating the trio of Krillen, 18, and 16 in a fight, with them 
        all blinded and unable to seer what they were aiming at. Cell then smacked 
        Krillen and 16 silly, before going on to absorb #18, with Trunks unable 
        to get their in time to stop it, much to the delight of Vegeta who'd just 
        arrived back on the scene.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>169. Perfect Cell vs. Krillen and Trunks</p>
      <p>After becoming complete, the first thing Cell did was take the best of 
        attacks from Trunks and Krillen, with neither one able to so much as make 
        him cringe. Even Krillen's Destructo disc didn't work, just breaking in 
        half upon making impact. Cell turned round, and with one swift kick he 
        knocked Krillen to the floor, breaking many of his bones.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>170. Perfect Cell vs. Vegeta</p>
      <p>Vegeta then challenged Cell, expecting a challenge this time round. The 
        two fought with the winner seeming to inevitably be Cell, until Vegeta 
        tricked him into taking a Final Flash full on, with the result being that 
        half of Cell's body was blown right off. Fortunately for him though he 
        was able to regenerate it due to having Piccolo's cells, and after that 
        he effortlessly knocked Vegeta unconscious.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>171. Trunks vs. Perfect Cell </p>
      <p>Krillen took Vegeta away leaving Trunks to become a fully Ascended Saiyan 
        and fight Cell. At first it seemed he would win until Cell informed him 
        that his speed was lacking with his improved strength, proving his point 
        by absolutely destroying Trunks effortlessly. The Earth's last hope then 
        realized resistance was futile, and powered down, ready to take his death 
        like a man. Cell decided that he'd like to fight them all a a higher strength 
        though, and said he'd arrange a tournament provided that everyone gets 
        powerful enough to challenge him this time. He hadn't even begun to show 
        his full strength yet..</p>
