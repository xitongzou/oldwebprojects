No one could match his power level, and he could transform 3 times. He controlled an empire, ruling several planets, had an elite force called the Ginyu Force, and got Raditz, Nappa, and Vegeta to do his bidding. He even destroyed the saiyan's home planet Vegeta because he was afraid of the super saiyans. He killed both Goku's father (Bardock), and Vegeta's father (King Vegeta). He uses special devices called scouters which determined an enemy's fighting power, which he stole from the saiyans. His brother, Koola also controlled an empire and he could transform 4 times! When planet Vegeta exploded, 7 saiyans escaped (Raditz, Kakarot, Nappa, Vegeta, Taurus, Pythanas, and the super saiyan named Brolli). When Frieza went after the dragonballs on planet Namek, Vegeta decided to rebel against Frieza, which led him to be on the good guys side(for a while). Frieza later killed Vegeta, and Goku succeeded in killing him. When Freiza killed Krillen, Goku's best friend, Goku went mad and turned super saiyan, the very thing Freiza was afraid of. Frieza killed Goku in the middle of the battle, but Goku got wished back by the dragonballs. Frieza sliced himself up with his own energy discs, and Goku offered him a chance to leave the planet before it explodes. Freiza refused, and Goku killed him. A while later, Freiza's father King Cold had him rebuilt into a robot, but nevertheless Freiza and his father got disposed of by the mysterious stranger known as Trunks.<br>Attacks: Freeza beam, Frieza slicer, energy disc, eye beam, death ball, super freeza blast, black hole.<br>Power level at beginning of DBZ: 534,000<br>Power level at end of DBZ: 12,500,000<br>Father: King ColdBrother: Koola<br>Class: Changeling<br></p></body></html>
