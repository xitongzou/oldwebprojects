 We see the evil man from before, playing pinball. His name is Red,&nbsp; the&nbsp;
 leader of the Red Ribbon army. He's talking to Black, his right hand&nbsp;
 man. He&nbsp; tells Black not to stand next to him,  as it makes Red look short. Red&nbsp;
 is a&nbsp;
 midget.</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 They've reached the beach, and the turtle, Umigame, says he'll&nbsp; repay&nbsp;
 them. He goes into the ocean, and promises to be back by morning. Goku&nbsp;
 wakes&nbsp; up at sunrise, and walks up into Bulma's room while she's asleep. He&nbsp;
 sees&nbsp; she's wearing a nightgown and panties. It reminds Goku of when he slept&nbsp;
 on&nbsp; his Grandpa's "pillow of balls". He lies down on Bulma's panties, and&nbsp;
 says&nbsp; it's different. He takes the panties off, and looks. He lets out a&nbsp;
 scream.&nbsp; "Your balls are gone!". Bulma wakes up and runs over to her bag. The&nbsp;
 Dragonballs are still there. She's awake now, so they go for a walk&nbsp;
 outside.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 Umigame is back with an old man on his back. The old man is named&nbsp; Kame&nbsp;
 Sen'nin, but some people call him Master Roshi. He notices the staff on&nbsp;
 Goku,&nbsp; and asks if his Grandpa was Son Gohan. Roshi is the man who trained&nbsp;
 Gohan. To&nbsp; reward them, he calls for a Phoenix. Umigame reminds him the Phoenix&nbsp;
 died&nbsp; from food poisoning. So, he calls for the Kinto'un. Kinto'un is a&nbsp;
 yellow&nbsp; cloud that people with pure hearts can fly on. Roshi, Bulma, and Oolong&nbsp;
 can't&nbsp; ride it, but Goku can.&nbsp;</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 Bulma notices that Roshi has the 3 star ball on his necklace. She&nbsp; explains the legend to Roshi, and Puar and Yamcha overheard. Yamcha&nbsp;
 wants to&nbsp; wish for his fear of women to go away so he can get married. Puar is&nbsp;
 surprised that he likes women. Roshi will let Bulma have the ball on&nbsp;
 once&nbsp; condition; Bulma shows him her panties. She lifts up her nightgown, but&nbsp;
 she's&nbsp; completely naked (Goku took her panties off, remember). She gets the&nbsp;
 ball,&nbsp; and goes inside to change. She realizes her panties were off, and is&nbsp;
 about to
 kill Goku.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 Missiles begin to shoot from the sea, and the car is blown up. The&nbsp; Dragon&nbsp;
 Radar is buried in the sand. Their being shot at by the Red Ribbon&nbsp;
 army's&nbsp; navy! Leading the navy is Captain Blue. Master Roshi and everyone hide&nbsp;
 behind&nbsp; a rock. He says that he'll stop the navy. He takes off his shirt and&nbsp;
 walks&nbsp; out into the open. His muscles triple in size. Yamcha says he's going&nbsp;
 to use&nbsp; his ki to attack. Roshi yells Kamehameha, and a blue beam fires from&nbsp;
 his&nbsp; hands and destroys all of the ships of the Red Ribbon. But, they&nbsp;
 weren't&nbsp; finished. A group of submarines appear from underwater. Everyone but&nbsp;
 Goku&nbsp; runs away. Goku yells Kamehameha, and destroys all of the subs.&nbsp;
 Everyone is&nbsp; dumbfounded. It took Roshi 50 years to learn that attack, but it took&nbsp;
 Goku 50&nbsp; seconds!&nbsp;</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 Another set of missiles are shot at Goku and everyone. Now,&nbsp; helicopters&nbsp;
 (with Captain Blue) are attacking. Goku is knocked unconscious and&nbsp;
 buried by&nbsp; the sand. Bulma is put at gunpoint, and gives Blue the balls. Yamcha is&nbsp;
 about&nbsp; to hit Blue from behind, but Bulma screams "HI!", and Yamcha looks at&nbsp;
 her.&nbsp; While paralyzed with fear, he and Puar are captured. That night, the&nbsp;
 beeping&nbsp; of the Dragon Radar woke Goku up. He gets on his Kinto'un with the&nbsp;
 Dragon&nbsp; Radar.&nbsp;</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 Back at the Red Ribbon HQ, Blue enters the chambers of Leader Red.&nbsp; Black&nbsp;
 tells Red what happened. Blue gives him the 5 balls he got. But Red&nbsp;
 points&nbsp; out that Blue forgot a Dragonball that was near that area (The one Goku&nbsp;
 has).&nbsp; "And what happens to people who make mistakes, Black?" Red muses.&nbsp;
 "Execution." Blue pleads for his life, and is shot.&nbsp;</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 Goku is flying across the world trying to find Bulma and everyone&nbsp; by&nbsp;
 using the Dragon Radar. The scenes between this and Bulma and everyone&nbsp;
 in the&nbsp; jail cell. Goku flies around dodging and defeating all of the troops of&nbsp;
 the&nbsp; Red Ribbon.</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 In the jail cell, Bulma tells Oolong to transform into a key.&nbsp; Yamcha says&nbsp;
 it's a great idea, and he stares at Bulma for a while. Kagi is Japanese&nbsp;
 for&nbsp; Key. Oolong turns into a crab (Kani), paper (kami), and pretty much&nbsp;
 everything else that starts with "ka". Finally he turns into a key and&nbsp;
 they&nbsp; get out of the cell. At the same time, Goku makes it to the island&nbsp;
 where the&nbsp; Red Ribbon HQ is. Goku's fight with the troops destroys a lot of the&nbsp;
 island.&nbsp; Red gathers the Dragonballs and leaves with Black to get to shelter.</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 Bulma, Roshi, Umigamre, Oolong, Puar, and Yamcha meet up with Goku&nbsp; outside. They see Red and Black with the Dragonballs run inside of a&nbsp;
 pillar.&nbsp; Inside the pillar, Red says that he's mad because he'll never be tall.&nbsp;
 Black&nbsp; asks if that's why he wanted the Dragonballs. He says yes. Black&nbsp;
 thought that&nbsp; it was because the Red Ribbon would rule the world. Black shot Red, and&nbsp;
 the&nbsp; Dragonballs fell outside. Black flew across the island and got inside a&nbsp;
 Giant&nbsp; robot. Black said that he was the new Leader, and that he would destroy&nbsp;
 the&nbsp; Red Ribbon Army and create the Black Ribbon Army. The robot attacked&nbsp;
 Goku and&nbsp; destroyed a lot of the island. The robot that Black was in beat Goku&nbsp;
 up.&nbsp;</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 When Goku was unconscious and about to be killed, 8-chan flew onto&nbsp; the&nbsp;
 scene. He punched the robot and it was stuck on the ground. He tried to&nbsp;
 wake&nbsp; Goku up. The robot got back up rather quickly. 8-chan said that he&nbsp;
 would&nbsp; fight anyone who hurt Goku. He hurts Black's robot, but is crushed&nbsp;
 between&nbsp; the robot's hands. His arms are broken, and gears are popping out of&nbsp;
 his&nbsp; chest. Goku wakes up and sees what 8-chan is doing. Black yells "DIE!"&nbsp;
 and&nbsp; squishes 8-chan between the hands of the robot. The mangled remains of&nbsp;
 8-chan&nbsp; fall next to Goku. He asks if Goku is all right. Goku says he is.&nbsp;
 "Good" says&nbsp; 8-chan. Then he dies.</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 Goku cries, and a blue pillar of light appears around him. Black&nbsp; says&nbsp;
 that it's about time that the stupid monster(8-chan) was dead." Goku,&nbsp;
 still&nbsp; in tears,  says that Black is the only stupid monster and unleashes a&nbsp;
 huge&nbsp; Kamehameha. Black laughs at first, but then realizes that he's lost.&nbsp;
 The&nbsp; robot explodes, and Black dies. "Come out, Shenron!" Bulma calls for&nbsp;
 Shenron,&nbsp; and he appears. Bulma and Yamcha don't want their original wishes.&nbsp;
 Shenron&nbsp; wonders if no one has a wish. Goku wishes 8-chan back to life, but&nbsp;
 without&nbsp; the bomb in him. "It shall be done!"&nbsp;</font></p>
