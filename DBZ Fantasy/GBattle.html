        Garlic Jr. Saga</p>
      <p>92. Garlic Jr. vs. People</p>
      <p>Garlic Jr. is in a town destroying it, and killing many people just for 
        the sake of being ruthless. This a rather pointless fight, with no honor, 
        as he knows he can win, but just proves how evil he is.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>93. Gohan vs. Fish</p>
      <p>Gohan is swimming in the icy cold water, catching fish for supper. He 
        throws a great deal out, becoming the victor, and earning what he eats.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>94. Piccolo vs. Piccolo vs. Piccolo vs. Piccolo</p>
      <p>After splitting into four forms of himself, Piccolo fights himself for 
        training, with all of his attacks visually faster, and more powerful. 
        After he feels he has done enough of that kind of training, he merges 
        back into one.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>95. Mr. Popo vs. Spice Boys</p>
      <p>Garlic Jr's henchmen venture onto Kami's lookout, and in order to achieve 
        their goals, they attack Mr. Popo, and imprison him in a small glass jar. 
        The fight is short lived, with the overwhelming numbers, and Popo's mediocre 
        battle strength.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>96. Kami vs. Garlic Jr. and the Spice Boys</p>
      <p>Essentially the same thing as the Mr. Popo fight, but with Kami actually 
        retaliating, and causing a fair bit of damage towards Garlic Jr. before 
        the Spice Boys stepped in, and captured Kami in the small glass jar, making 
        him about the same size as the palm of a hand, just as has been done to 
        Mr. Popo.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>97. Gohan vs. Chi-Chi</p>
      <p>After the blackwater mist has taken effect, all the people on Earth, 
        with the exceptions of Gohan, Krillen, and Marron, have been turned into 
        mindless zombies to do the bidding of Garlic Jr. Chi-Chi is one of these 
        people, and she attacks her son, unable to hit him due to his superior 
        speed, but she relentless attacks all the same. She jumps on Gohan, and 
        he instinctively throws her off him, with her landing hard on the ground. 
        Sorry for his actions, he quickly sprints over to her to make sure she 
        is alright, only to be attacked once more. It goes on for a while, with 
        Gohan having no choice but to continue retreating.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>98. Krillen vs. Yamcha</p>
      <p>Yamcha is a mindless zombie too, and is mercilessly attacking Krillen, 
        getting the occasional attack on target. The bald midget doesn't want 
        to retaliate though, because he doesn't want to hurt his friend. Krillen 
        continues to run for a while, with no where to go.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>99. Marron vs. Master Roshi</p>
      <p>Roshi is possessed as a mindless zombie, and true to his perverted nature, 
        he goes after the girl. She throws every single object that is anywhere 
        near her, clunking Roshi on the head constantly, before having to run 
        once more, like the other 'normal', unpossessed people. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>100. Spice Boys vs. Gohan</p>
      <p>After the Spice Boys arrive, Gohan finds out it was them that did this 
        to all his friends, so he attacks. Obviously one small boy can't take 
        four grown men on by himself, so he loses badly, as they hang him in the 
        air. It looks as though they are going to finish him, when Piccolo steps 
        in to save him.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>101. Piccolo vs. Spice Boys and Zombies</p>
      <p>Piccolo starts to fight the Spice Boys, but it is soon intervened by 
        the zombie of Yamcha. Piccolo fights with him for a while, then reluctantly 
        prepares to kill them, expecting to be able to wish them back with the 
        Dragonballs after this ordeal is over. Before he can though, the Spice 
        Boys attack from every orifice, and take him by surprise, distracting 
        him long enough for all the zombies to sink their fangs into his neck, 
        supposedly turning him into one of them. Piccolo quickly tells Gohan and 
        Krillen to flee, before passing out from the pain.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>102. Gohan and Krillen vs. Spice Boys</p>
      <p>On Kami's lookout, Gohan and Krillen met up with the Spice Boys once 
        more. This time though, they engaged in a fight, with two Spice Boys taking 
        them on. Gohan fought a small, red, plump one, and Krillen fought a muscular, 
        hairy, horned one. Both of the Earth's people were beaten severely, but 
        just as Gohan was about to be hit with a powerful energy beam, Krillen 
        dived in the way, taking the blast for him, and it resulted in him getting 
        knocked down, unable to get up. Angered by this, Gohan shot out two Masenko's, 
        killing both of the Spice Boys outright, leaving only two more.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>103. Piccolo vs. Gohan</p>
      <p>The Namek burst forth from Spice's grip, and uppercuts Gohan in the jaw. 
        The two fight for a while, with Piccolo having an obvious advantage, choking 
        the little Saiyan, and leaving him close to death.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>104. Krillen and Gohan vs. Piccolo and Garlic Jr.</p>
      <p>Whilst Garlic was watching Piccolo and Gohan fight, Krillen decides to 
        run forward, and try and grab the bottles with Kami and Mr. Popo. He fails 
        though due to a forcefield around the evil one. Garlic Jr. then gets up, 
        and kicks Krillen in the head repeatedly, sending him through a pillar. 
        Garlic Jr. holds out a hand to blast him, but as he lets loose, Gohan 
        makes Piccolo go flying backwards with a sudden rush of energy, hitting 
        the Namek into the path of the beam, and saving Krillen. Piccolo lies 
        on the floor, hurt badly.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>105. Piccolo vs. Krillen</p>
      <p>The Namek gets up, and is about to grab Gohan violently when Krillen 
        pushes the kid out of the way. Settling for the midget, Piccolo sinks 
        his teeth in Krillen's neck, slowly draining his energy, and turning him 
        into a mindless zombie, just as he and the others have become. Krillen 
        drops to the floor, and shows no sign of movement.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>106. Piccolo vs. Gohan</p>
      <p>With Krillen out of the way, Piccolo resumes putting a beating on Gohan, 
        hurting him badly with an array of techniques, including splitting up 
        into three separate entities. Gohan is destroyed, and hit through a wall 
        where he meets Krillen. He is already badly hurt, and thinks for some 
        reason that Krillen is on his team, although he was bitten by Piccolo 
        earlier.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>107. Piccolo and Krillen vs. Gohan</p>
      <p>The two put a beating on the kid, giving him even more punishment than 
        he suffered earlier. Every time Garlic Jr's minions tried to step in, 
        Piccolo and Krillen got in their way, and continued to beat Gohan senseless, 
        due to their supposed hatred of him. Just as Piccolo is about to finish 
        Gohan off, Garlic Jr. steps in, and decides he will finish him off after 
        all. Piccolo grabs the bottles, and throws them to Krillen, who releases 
        Kami and Popo. They reveal that it has all been a trick, and Piccolo was 
        never affected because he is already a demon.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>108. Piccolo vs. Garlic Jr.</p>
      <p>Piccolo has a firm advantage in this fight, countering everything that 
        Garlic Jr. could try to do, and paying it back ten fold. After a while, 
        Garlic Jr. can no longer take the punishment, and is forced to transform 
        into a stronger version of his immortal self with use of the machio star.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>109. Gohan and Krillen vs. Spice Boys</p>
      <p>The two remaining Spice Boys fought with Gohan and Krillen, and seemed 
        to be totally destroying them, until the two Earth's people put together 
        a string of incredible moves, which resulted in the leader, Spice, being 
        impaled on a spike, and the other Spice Boy being blasted with a Masenko. 
        It seems that the fight is over, until they somehow manage to look up 
        at the machio star, which gives them extra strength, and allows them to 
        transform into more muscular, powerful versions of themselves, getting 
        fully healed by the stars rays.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>110. Gohan and Krillen vs. Transformed Spice Boys</p>
      <p>The two are pummeled, especially Krillen, who is kicked around the floor 
        by both Spice Boys, and put through excruciating pain. He is thrown off 
        the side of the lookout, but when Gohan tries to save him, the Spice Boys 
        get in his way. Enraged at the fact that his friend could fall to his 
        death, Gohan lets loose with two Masenko's, killing both Spice Boys immediately. 
        He then catches up with Krillen, and saves him, bring him back up to the 
        lookout.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>111. Kami vs. Guardians</p>
      <p>First Kami fights a singular guardian, but then more come, making him 
        have to run away. Hr sprints through the dark, dingy corridors, eventually 
        coming to a stop near the end, and having to face around 5 past guardians. 
        They all slowly suck the life from him. Meanwhile, Mr. Popo is emptying 
        the sacred water into the 7 winds of the Earth, to nullify the dark water 
        mist. It works, and the guardians let Kami go, when they realize that 
        he has done nothing wrong, and there is no point in tormenting him further.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>112. Piccolo vs. Transformed Garlic Jr.</p>
      <p>Piccolo and Garlic Jr. are fairly evenly matched now, and neither is 
        able to finish the other one off. Piccolo decides to extend his limbs 
        a little, in order to make himself as big as the transformed Garlic Jr., 
        and gains a massive advantage by doing this. It seems that he is going 
        to win easily, until he begins to disappear, because of what is happening 
        to Kami. He swings, but his hand goes right through Garlic Jr's head, 
        allowing the evil one to take advantage, and put a major beating on Piccolo. 
        Seeing that his mentor can't protect himself due to reasons out of his 
        control, Gohan steps in, and catches Garlic Jr's fist, just as he goes 
        for a death punch.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>113. Gohan vs. Transformed Garlic Jr.</p>
      <p>This was a quick, one-sided fight for for majority of it, with Gohan 
        dominating Garlic Jr. He managed to charge up, and went at such speed 
        that he ripped a hole through his opponents stomach. Following it up with 
        a Masenko, Gohan assumed that the fight must have been over, but Garlic 
        Jr. managed to get up, even stronger than ever.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>114. Gohan, Piccolo, and Krillen vs. Transformed Garlic Jr.</p>
      <p>Gohan is in the position to be destroyed by Garlic Jr, when Piccolo soars 
        in, knocking the evil one across the floor, and attempting to follow through 
        with a punch, but failing miserably, due to Kami's condition, with him 
        constantly fading out, and making Piccolo do the same. Garlic Jr. pummels 
        him hard to the ground, and prepares to finish him off. Krillen charges 
        in to Piccolo's aid, but is swatted away like a fly. The same thing happens 
        to Gohan soon after, as he is smacked into the piles of rubble.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>115. Krillen vs. Transformed Garlic Jr.</p>
      <p>On the floor next to Piccolo, with Garlic quickly advancing on them, 
        Krillen knew that he had to do something, and he did. With an awesome 
        array of moves, he used excellent fighting technique to overcome Garlic 
        Jr, and knock him into a huge crater, finishing his sequence of attacks 
        off with a KameHameHa. Of course though, Garlic is immortal, so he managed 
        to get straight back up. He grabs Krillen by the neck, and begins to choke 
        him out.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>116. Piccolo vs. Transformed Garlic Jr.</p>
      <p>Seeing Krillen in trouble, Piccolo charges in, even though he is in no 
        condition to fight. He hits Garlic in the stomach as hard as he can, but 
        doesn't even dent it, as his hand begins fading away again. Capitalizing 
        on this, Garlic picks up Piccolo by the head in his free hand, now holding 
        both Krillen and the Namek.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>117. Piccolo, Gohan, and Krillen vs. Transformed Garlic Jr.</p>
      <p>Gohan manages to get on his feet, and yells at Garlic, temporarily distracting 
        him, and allowing Piccolo and Krillen time to escape from the evil fiends 
        grip. They both kick him in the chest, with Krillen simultaneously going 
        down and grabbing Garlic's leg, and Piccolo grabbing his head. They order 
        Gohan to fire, but he knows it wont do anything, but eventually lets rip, 
        although it is too late, and Garlic Jr. is able to break free of the Namek 
        and human's grips, evading the attack in the process. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>118. Gohan vs. Garlic Jr.</p>
      <p>Garlic Jr. decides that the only way for him to win is to reopen the 
        dead zone, so he does, sucking in everything that dares to be anywhere 
        near. Gohan is forced to put up a KI shield around himself and his friends, 
        in order to prevent either him or his injured friends from getting sucked 
        in. Piccolo orders that Gohan focuses on destroying the machio star, but 
        the kid won't lower the protection of his friends. Garlic keeps on powering 
        up, making the dead zone stronger and stronger, and forcing Gohan to increase 
        the power of his shield, in a fit of rage.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>119. Krillen and Piccolo vs. Garlic Jr</p>
      <p>Kami returns, and Piccolo regains all of his power, deciding to fly out 
        of Gohan's forcefield, and to attack, and resist the power of Garlic Jr. 
        He floats over, and throws an energy beam straight at the evil one. It 
        is countered by a belly beam from the evil one, as he holds Piccolo's 
        blast in one hand. Knowing that he is the one stopping Gohan from finishing 
        the fight, Krillen flies out of the protection, and battles Garlic Jr. 
        He and Piccolo are stuck, having to put all their effort into blocking 
        Garlic Jr's attack, and resisting the dead zone, while Gohan stands on 
        the floor, thoroughly upset. His friends yell to him to destroy the machio 
        star, and he understands.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>120. Gohan vs. Garlic Jr.</p>
      <p>With a fit of rage, Gohan charges up a huge ball of energy in seconds, 
        and sends it soaring straight at the machio star, destroying it on contact. 
        Garlic Jr loses all of his power, and shrivels up, before being sucked 
        into his own dead zone, to be eternally imprisoned. The dead zone closes, 
        and Piccolo and Krillen fall back down to Earth. Everyone seems ok, with 
        the rest of the Earth having been cured.</p>
