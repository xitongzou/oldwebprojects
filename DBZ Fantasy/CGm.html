beautiful Asian woman who works for Emperor Pilaf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Together, Mai and her partner Shao carry out the work of their ambitious
Emperor, who is both short of stature and temper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mai is definitely the brighter of the two, but even she manages to bungle
things, particularly when Goku and crew become involved.</span></font></p>

<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">
Krillin’s ditzy girlfriend in the Garlic Junior Saga, she appears only in the
anime.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not to be confused with
Marron, Krillin’s daughter later in DBZ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Maron resembles Bulma, but the two are quite different as far as
intelligence is concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Krillin’s
girlfriend has the sex appeal of a super model and the brainpower of an orange.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She’s also anything but loyal, and proves it time and again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the end of the Garlic Junior Saga, Krillin is about to propose to
Maron when she suddenly leaves him for a guy in a red sports car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Maron returns later in the Android Saga looking for Krillin at the Kame
House.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, she doesn’t last
more than a handful of episodes before Maron gets lonely and calls a few of her
boyfriends to pick her up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“A
few” becomes more like 20 when a fleet of boats and hovercrafts arrive at the
fickle girl’s service, and she rides away from Kame Island for good.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><b>Marron</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Daughter of Krillin and Android
18.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not to be confused with Maron,
Krillin’s girlfriend earlier in the anime.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As a child, Marron resembles her father more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She has his big eyes and nose, or rather lack of nose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, she does indeed have a nose, though small, and as she grows
older, Marron begins to look more like her mother.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Marron first appears in the early Buu Saga as a toddler.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She cheers on her mommy at the 25<sup>th</sup> Tenkaichi Budoukai, and
proves to be one of the only people who can make 18 smile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Their heartwarming relationship lasts through GT, when Marron is a
teenager.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, she doesn’t
fight or train at all, but she loves both of her parents very much.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">Master
Roshi - “Mutenroshi” (also Kame Sennin)<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span>&nbsp;</b> <font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Master
Roshi is the bald old man seen from time to time with a pair of sunglasses and a
long beard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He is Goku’s old
Sensei in Dragonball, and is several hundred years old at the beginning of the
series.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He is also called Kame
Sennin, or the Turtle Hermit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
lives on a tiny island in the middle of the ocean called Kame Island with his
“pet” turtle, named Turtle in the dub.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Master Roshi was born in 430 AD, and once drank from the fountain of
youth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, instead of keeping
him young-looking, it only extended his life span.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He trains under the great master of martial arts, Mutaito, alongside his
rival Crane Elder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Master Roshi
becomes the strongest man in the world after the death of his sensei, and he
participates in many Tenkaichi Budoukai’s in his years, winning every single
one he enters up to the 22<sup>nd</sup> Tenkaichi Budoukai.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Roshi becomes a pervert at the age of 123, and over his hundreds of years
spent on Kame Island, he builds the world’s largest collection of dirty
magazines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Roshi constantly tries
to grab the boobs and poke the butt of any remotely sexy woman he can get close
enough to; this list includes, but is not limited to: Bulma, Lunch, Chi Chi and
Maron.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He meets Goku in the early
episodes of Dragonball in the year 749 AD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In September of that same year, Roshi begins training Goku and Krillin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As the years pass, Roshi is surpassed by all of the Z Senshi, though he
never loses his fighting spirit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
appears in most of the DB and DBZ Movies, usually as comic relief in the DBZ
films.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Master Roshi weighs only
97lbs, and is 5’4” tall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
home address at Kame Island is NBI8250012B (I’d like to see the mailman who
delivers HIS mail every day… perhaps the same one who delivers Korin’s
mail).<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Mez
- “Mezu”*<o:p>

</b></font></span>&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A
red ogre who keeps watch over the dead souls in Hell.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Mez is the second ogre to greet Goku after he falls off Snake
Way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He wears glasses and a shirt
with the word HELL spelled out on it (which Pioneer conveniently changes to HFIL).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mez boasts to be the fastest ogre in Hell, and announces that if Goku can
beat him in a race, the ogres will show him a secret passageway back to Snake
Way.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Goku easily outruns Mez, a feat that stuns the ogres who must
keep their word.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">Mr.
Popo - “Misuta Popo”<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span>&nbsp; </b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">Kame’s
faithful servant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Popo is very
old, and he has served every Kami of the past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His job consists of tending to Kami’s Palace, keeping the lookout
clean, and most importantly, taking care of Kami. He also tends to the ancient
butterfly garden that he planted thousands of years ago, and enjoys the more
simple things in life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While
FUNi’s Mr. Popo speaks using complete, highly intelligent sentences, the
Japanese version proves him to be a slightly more primitive figure.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>His grasp of the common tongue is somewhat less than the
dubbed version makes it out to be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Though
it is not obvious, Mr. Popo is an excellent martial arts master.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In Dragonball, Mr. Popo is far stronger than Goku when he first arrives
at Kami’s Palace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He trains Goku
for 3 years until the boy learns everything he knows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Some of the techniques he teaches Goku later prove invaluable, for
example the ability to sense ki.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="ES" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: ES"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Mr.
Satan - “Misuta Satan”<o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></span>&nbsp; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">Father
of Videl and grandfather of Pan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While
the Japanese version never reveals his first name, the dub gives him one –
Hercule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Satan is the winner of
the 24<sup>th</sup> Tenkaichi Budoukai, which takes place around the Trunks
Saga.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>None of the Z Senshi happen
to participate in the tournament that year, and so Mr. Satan becomes the famous
champion of the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although he
is quite strong for a human, he is nothing compared to the Z Senshi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, hardly a single Earthling realizes this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Almost everyone on Earth believes that Mr. Satan is the strongest man in
the world, and can defeat anyone or anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, with TV appearances, books written and movies made after him, Mr.
Satan becomes immortalized in the minds of every man, woman and child on the
planet as the World Champion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a
renowned master of the martial arts, he performs amazing feats live on
television for all the world to see, such as breaking 22 bricks with a single
karate chop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He has a city named
after him, and the town he lives in becomes Satan City overnight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Eventually he lets all the fame and popularity go to his head, until Mr.
Satan is little more than an egomaniac who happens to be extremely lucky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In 756 AD he has a daughter named Videl.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>His wife dies young, before Videl can remember her very well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>While Mr. Satan enjoys his fame, he loved his wife and probably misses
her very much, although it is never mentioned directly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although cowardly compared to the Z Senshi, Mr. Satan is neither a
complete coward nor a fool, and manages to keep at least a general appearance of
confidence and calm through much of the strange events, no easy task for the
average human.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>(add name of moves?)<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span>&nbsp; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">Mr.
Satan first appears in DBZ in the Cell Saga, where he appears at the Cell Game
to take out Cell alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course,
he is only fooling himself, but even when he begins to realize that Cell is too
much for him, he cannot let his confidence drop for a second, because the ZTV
camera is on him the majority of the time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Millions of people watch him, and with each one’s hopes lying on him,
Mr. Satan cannot show fear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cell
handles the egomaniac quite well, considering just about everyone at the
tournament sweats terribly at the sight of Mr. Satan on the tournament floor
except him.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Satan takes up several episodes with his bragging and
jeering, and his lackeys cheering him on, but Cell simply knocks him far away
with one swipe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the anime, Mr.
Satan is shown cowering behind boulders for several scenes and trying to
convince the audience watching that he is still the strongest, and that all the
other fighters are simply using light tricks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He helps Gohan turn Super Saiyajin 2 when he reluctantly carries Android
16’s severed head to where Gohan is standing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After the Cell Game, Mr. Satan returns home crowing that it was he who
defeated and destroyed Cell, although Gohan is the real champion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Almost everyone on Earth believes Mr. Satan, and he is praised
internationally for saving the world.</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;
</span>In the Buu Saga, Mr. Satan returns in the 25<sup>th</sup> Tenkaichi
Budoukai, but he hasn’t forgotten the Z Senshi, whom he knows to be far
stronger than he.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He tries
everything to get out of fighting, but after the Z Senshi take off in search of
Babidi, and a few disqualifications are made, he ends up making it to the finals
with Android 18.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He convinces her
to let him win, and in return Mr. Satan agrees to give her the prize money.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And so the great Mr. Satan is again crowned World Champion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He later takes on Majin Buu, and uses many tactics in effort to kill the
magical creature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, Buu only
thinks of it as a game, and the two become friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mr. Satan tries to reform Buu, and nearly succeeds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The two even get a little dog, named Bee.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>However, two sick gunmen arrive in town and shoot first the
puppy, then Mr. Satan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Buu heals
them both instantly and releases his evil half.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Throughout the Buu Saga, Mr. Satan attempts to help out where he can.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He is lucky enough to survive the destruction of Earth when Goku grabs
him just before teleporting to Namek II.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
the planet is wished back, Vegeta uses a special psychic link to speak to the
people of Earth, and tries to convince the planet’s population to give their
energy to Goku for the Genki Dama (Spirit Bomb).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But, after all, Vegeta isn’t exactly the sociable type.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Where Vegeta fails, Mr. Satan is perfect for the job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He tells everyone on Earth to give their energy to Goku, and ends up
causing a huge chant all over the planet of “SATAN! SATAN!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mr. Satan and Buu remain best friends and live together for the rest of
the series.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He becomes a grandfather when his daughter Videl has a baby
girl named Pan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Satan has a few
minor roles in Movies 9-12, but just as in the series, throughout all of them he
somehow manages to defend and keep his title of World Champion.</span></font>
