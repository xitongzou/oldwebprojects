<p>
Cold numbness filled Raditz; he was dying fast. No healing in a
regen tank this time; the damage ran too deep. He could barely feel the
grass against his cheek.. unfortunately, he could still hear Vegeta
over the scouter's comm link, demanding to know what was going on.
<p>
I have an eight-inch hole punched through my heart, and I'm dying, and
oh, by the way, Kakarott is looking just like me right now--dead real
soon--and could you shut the hell up and let me die in peace, it's
been one rotten day, he thought briefly of saying. Not enough
breath. Tell Vegeta the important thing..
<p>
"He's a goner! The fool! How could he?" Raditz wondered as much to
himself as to Vegeta. How could Kakarott have thrown his life away?
Why did I throw mine away?
<p>
"Don't lose your long sleep over it. I'll bet Goku will be back here
in a week. " Piccolo sneered.
<p>
What? That green bastard thought I was talking to him--he doesn't know
about the comm link!  What did he just say?
<p>
"What? That's impossible! Tell...me...how!" At least Vegeta had shut
up long enough to listen over the scouter.
<p>
"Gladly. On this planet, we have something we call 'dragonballs.'
Whoever brings all seven dragonballs together gets any one wish
granted-- Goku's friends will use the dragonballs to wish him back in
no time. It's Goku that will have the last laugh," Piccolo gloated.
<p>
That'll work out okay for Kakarott. What are you, green man? You just
killed my brother, and I swear you enjoyed it, and now you're gloating
that he'll be alive again? I don't get you. I don't really get
Kakarott. I could see from the beginning of this fight you wanted to
kill my brother. Why couldn't he see it?  Or did he?  Did he really
want me dead so much he was willing to let you kill him?  'A true
warrior never hesitates to kill--even his own brother'.  I taught him
that, didn't I? Not the smartest thing I've ever done.
<p>
Raditz tasted the bitterness of his defeat--it had all gone so wrong,
he'd come seeking a brother, and found only enemies and death--and
spat defiance at the green man, "No. I'm afraid you're wrong, green
man. This device on my face is also a transmitter. Fool."
<p>
Yeah, Vegeta heard that! I can just see the gleam in his eyes
now.  You don't get it yet, do you, green man?  Let me explain it in
short words (I'm not sure I've got long enough left for long ones):
<p>
"They've heard every word. Now...they'll come. I know they
will. They'll want to make a wish."  Quit yelling in my ear Vegeta,
I'll tell them anything I please.
<p>
Kakarott's voice came weakly, "When will they be here??"
<p>
You're still with us, brother? I was a fool to think you a
weakling. You deserve an honest answer, and I'm going to enjoy pissing
off this green goon.
<p>
"One year. And the funny thing is..." Raditz started to chuckle--oh
god that hurt!--"they're much stronger than me."  Sounds like Vegeta's
having a stroke, hearing me admit THAT! Gee, greenie here doesn't look
so happy any more.. what a damn shame. This just gets better every
second.
<p>
"What's wrong? You look so depressed all of a sudden, green man. Don't
be so glum! We can't all have the last laugh." He laughed hysterically
at the bitter jest--it was his last laugh.  He didn't even feel the
final blow.

<p>
Darkness, light, a strange place. Raditz blinked; where was he?  A
golden bridge, leading to an impossible palace. Odd blue-skinned,
horned folk chivvied a crowd of drifting--what? Wisps of beings?  Nice
scenery, but how did I get here? And where is here? I feel
so.. weird. Hmmm.. on the minus side, no heartbeat, I'm not breathing,
and I have no idea what is going on; on the plus side, no fist-size
hole all the way through my chest, all the right pieces seem to be
there, including tail and hair, and, um, me. Dead is definitely NOT
what I thought it was.  He grinned to himself--
<p>
--and was rudely interrupted by a poke from one of the blue horned guys.
"No loitering! Move it, will ya!  King Yama doesn't like to be kept
waiting!"
<p>
A deep-seated resentment of beings with horns flared hot in Raditz,
and the unfortunate demon was greatly surprised to discover that he
could fly, from one end of the chasm of Eternity to the other.  The
other demons of the Bridge looked up; the nearest took note of the
wild hair and the long, thin furred tail wrapped about Raditz's
waist.
<p>
"Uh-oh. One of THEM. I just remembered, it's time for my mid-shift
break."  He very carefully backed away, through the gate and out of
sight.  The rest of the demons were less dignified; they just plain
ran. Raditz charged through the gate after them. And stopped cold.
<p>
"AND JUST WHO ARE YOU?" boomed the voice of the very large, red,
horned demon-god sitting enthroned before him. The question
reverberated in his soul, and Raditz became aware of himself as never
before; every memory, every sorrow, every joy of his past brought
forward and revealed. Again, he remembered the fierce joy of battle
and conquest, the comradery of his fellow warriors, the terrible grief
when all Vegetesai died--all gone, Zorn and Turles and Bardock his
father, and King Vegeta, and on forever--protecting and training the
young Prince Vegeta, and learning bitter humility and obedience under
Frieza, for they were the last of the Saiyajin, and death was not an
option--survival had to be all, until the Prince grew strong enough;
Earth, and meeting his little brother Kakarott as a grown man, and the
horror of realizing Kakarott had lost himself--he did not know he was
Saiyan, he had lost his tail, become weak, and he did not want to
fight! This last--too much, and Raditz tried to force Kakarott back to
the Saiyan path--the bitterness of rejection ("I don't want you as a
brother!")--(but for all his threats, he had not harmed the child or
Kakarott's friends)--learning that Kakarott had not lost the love of
the fight! Nor had he been so weak after all..
<p>
He felt himself weighed, judged, and found wanting--but
salvageable. King Yama judged him; somehow, Raditz was absolutely
certain of it. Exactly what King Yama was, Raditz had no idea; it was
enough that he was here, and those obnoxious demons worked for him.
Raditz hated imperious creatures with horns.  With a feral scream
Raditz leaped to the attack; he put all of his Saiyan strength into a
punch to the great demon's mid-section.
<p>
Then it all went wrong. He painfully slammed into the floor, face-first;
King Yama had both of Raditz's arms pulled behind him in one hand, and
grabbed his TAIL with the other! Tears started from his eyes from the
pain; his spirit-body still carried that vulnerability. How did that
monster move so fast? And not even Vegeta was that strong!
<p>
And then a hauntingly familiar voice growled somewhere behind him: "If
your majesty allows, I'll take care of this one." Raditz quailed
inwardly; that voice! It could not be!
<p>
The demon-god rumbled, "Up here recruiting again? I thought he looked
like one of yours. Just as ill-mannered as all of you were when you
first arrived. He belongs in the hells with you. Take him, and teach
him manners, Commander."  Raditz felt himself lifted and tossed,
skidding to land face down in front of a pair of booted feet. He
looked up as a strong hand grabbed him by the hair and dragged him to
his feet.
<p>
Aw, no. It really is him.  Why did it have to be him? Why did I
have to stupidly lose my temper in front of him? Time to face the
music (and wasn't that one of HIS favorite phrases?).
<p>
"Hello, father."
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Some time later, Raditz sat gingerly on the edge of a table in the
Guard barracks, holding his sore and battered ribs.
<p>
Okay, so I can't be killed again, but I can hurt just like it all over
again. Fun. And the rules are different--I don't get stronger from a
beating here--unless I learn something from it. I think that's what
father--er, Commander Bardock--said. Not that I have a clue what he
meant by that.
<p>
Ouch. He still can fight, though. I think he's even tougher than he
was.. before they all died. I don't think he's in Frieza's class, but
he could teach Nappa and Vegeta a few things.
<p>
I had it coming; father was not real happy with me. I screwed
up his plans and hopes rather thoroughly--I haven't been chewed
out like that since, well, he and King Vegeta died.

<p>
"I did not go to the trouble of rigging Kakarott's tests and getting
him sent to Earth, while I arranged an elite guard post with the Prince
for you, just so the two of you could meet on Earth and kill each other!
My intent," he snarled, "was that no matter what happened, at least one
of my sons would survive! You have managed to ruin all that! If
Kakarott's son had not survived that complete disaster you made of
things..." Bardock glared at his son. "What the hell were you
thinking with, your hair??"
<p>
Ouch. I had that coming. Damn, but Kakarott looked like you--younger,
and no scars--and when he got mad enough to fight, it was you all over
again.  Did you just say what I think you did?
<p>
"What do you mean, you rigged Kakarott's tests?"
<p>
Bardock laughed. "You really thought one of MY sons was only a third
class warrior? Not hardly. Your little brother rivaled Prince Vegeta in
his potential! As soon as I learned that, I forged his power ratings;
I didn't want him coming to Frieza's or King Vegeta's attention. They
never would have let me send him to an obscure planet for conquest."
Bardock looked grim, "Even then, I suspected that Frieza meant nothing
good for us--and I remember what King Vegeta did to the last child to
rival the Prince's power."
<p>
Now is not a good time to remind father that Brolli's father was a
complete raving nutcase, and the kid had even more bad head genes
added in from his mother's side. *I* would have ordered the kid
snuffed--let someone with Vegeta's power and none of his.. restraint
run loose? I don't think so.
<p>
Frieza. I really wanted to be reminded of him--the whole reason
everyone I ever cared about (except my Prince) is dead--hey, wait, so
am I! And if I am here... Can I really be done with Frieza that easily?
<p>
Raditz shuddered. "Am I truly, finally free of that horned bastard?"
<p>
Bardock regarded him. "Yes, in that he has no power to harm you any
more, nor even believes that you still exist. And no, for there is a
fierce hunger for vengeance, for JUSTICE, in all of us, that will not
be satisfied until he is destroyed. We are free of him, but he still
butchers his way across the universe with impunity, and that burns in
our souls."
<p>
The three of us weren't exactly thrilled, either--but we weren't
strong enough. We just weren't strong enough. We needed Kakarott, and
anyone else we could find--we never dreamed he had a son! Even Vegeta,
smart as he is, never guessed that my brother could have had a
son--how could he? There were no saiyan women left alive... Sorrow
cut keenly through Raditz for a moment.
<p>
"Vegeta hoped to become strong enough to fight him.  That's why he
sent me to Earth, to find Kakarott and get him to join us. Yeah, I
know I didn't pick a good way to recruit him--but it had to look
legitimate to Frieza and his flunkies; they recorded everything those
scouters transmitted back to base--that's why I tried to make Kakarott
conquer Earth for us--to make it look real.  That was just a cover,
though--what Vegeta really wanted another Saiyan warrior with us, for
the day we were strong enough to turn on Frieza and destroy him."
<p>
Bardock glared at him. "Bullshit. You meant to do exactly what you
told Kakarott you were going to do."
<p>
Raditz winced. Damn, I can lie to myself, but not to him! "I would
not have killed the kid! That was a bluff! Father, he's my nephew, and
a child--a Saiyan child! He had a tail.. and his power--incredible!
Our race is NOT extinct! Do you think I would have killed that
wonderful child? What kind of monster do you think I am?"
<p>
"Not the monster I feared you might have become. You seem to have
become a bully and a fool, instead.  You and Vegeta planned to destroy
Earth--WHERE DO YOU THINK THE CHILD'S MOTHER CAME FROM? Kakarott by
sheer luck or inevitable destiny landed on the one world in the entire
galaxy whose people can interbreed with us.  Do you have any idea how
impossible that should be?  We Saiyajin have been given a second
chance--and you idiots would throw that chance away!"
<p>
Bardock glared coldly at his son. "What was it you told your brother?
Oh, yes--'Youth I might forgive, but idiocy has no place on a saiyan
mission!' And you DARED call him 'a shame to our race'?? YOU??
You--who made false promises and lied just to escape defeat, you who
threatened small children, you who tortured your own younger brother
when he made the mistake of thinking you actually had honor! Yes, you
are quite the 'true warrior', Raditz! I am ashamed that you are of my
blood! Don't you ever DARE call anyone 'a shame to our race'
again--you're not worthy to decide that." Bardock's contempt was
palpable. He leaned closer to his demoralized son. "And I wouldn't be
talking about other people's idiocy if I were you, either."
<p>
I can't actually die of shame--even if I weren't already dead.  I can
wish with all my heart that I could find a rock on the far side of a
cold, airless outer planet in a distant galaxy to crawl under, but
that doesn't seem to work, either. And yet..
<p>
Raditz lifted his head. "The funny thing is," he said quietly, "I
started breaking Kakarott's ribs one at a time, because I couldn't
bring myself to finish him.  For all my big talk, I was half hoping
that someone would stop me before it was too late." A short, ironic
laugh. "I never expected it to be the kid."
<p>
Bardock looked at him with an unfathomable expresssion in his
eyes. "There may be hope for you yet."
<p>
Bardock paced. "Bad enough when there were only the four of you left,
but now there's only Vegeta and Nappa and the child left.  Vegeta and
Nappa would destroy this world, this last hope, because Vegeta's
bloated, self-centered ego is more important to him than the survival
of our race, and sooner or later, Frieza will tire of the last of the
Saiyans and finish the job he started four years ago!  Of course,
Vegeta will try to stop Frieza--"
<p>
"--and if Prince Vegeta is as much like his father as I think he is, he
WILL make the same mistake King Vegeta did; he'll think himself strong
enough long before he really is, because he WANTS to be strong
enough." Bardock continued, prophetically, "Prince Vegeta will find
out the hard way that Frieza is far more powerful than he ever
imagined, and I will be greeting him as I did you."

<p>
"Why did you have to kill your brother? He had the potential, and the
patience--and he is the father of a saiyan child! He and Prince Vegeta
together, perhaps.. But no. Vegeta's princely ego would never allow
it.  We truly are a damned race." The bleakness in Bardock's eyes
disturbed Raditz.
<p>
Don't look at me like that! Why do you say such things?  Why must you
tell me the truth? I cannot endure this--but I do. I would rather
die--but I am already dead. But I didn't kill Kakarott--it's my fault
he's dead, but I didn't strike the blow.. I didn't think he'd do it. I
just didn't believe he would let himself be killed like that--but
then, I didn't leave him a choice, did I?
<p>
Raditz defied his father's despair. "No! Kakarott may have died with
me, but he won't stay dead, not if what that alien said was true!"
<p>
"What?"
<p>
"Listen to me!"  Raditz quickly told Bardock of the Dragonballs, and
what Kakarott's friends might do with them. "It's hard to believe, but
I don't know what to believe any more." Like what I'm doing here, and
where is here, and what a 'true warrior' really is, and things like
that...
<p>
"Such things do exist." Bardock smiled slightly at Raditz's startled
look. "I know of them, because wishes have been used to return people
who were here to mortal life, and it's part of my office, to keep
track of such things.  Perhaps this destiny is not so dark after
all.."
<p>
Bardock lifted his head up, looking intently at something beyond
Raditz's perception.  "Ah. There he is. Wait here. And THINK."  With
that, his father vanished in a puff of sulfurous smoke.
<p>
How did he do that? What did he just do?  And who is 'he'?  Oh no. Of
course. Kakarott! So you're here, too, brother?  I don't think I'm
ready for this. Ahh, my ribs still hurt! I think he broke a bunch of
them--funny, just like I broke Kakarott's ribs. I'm not quite stupid
enough to think that was a coincidence.
<p>
I'm stupid enough to be here, though. I should not have lied to
Kakarott--he wasn't so stupid as to fall for the same trick
twice. Only-- it wasn't a trick the second time. I really didn't want
to die, and I didn't want him to die, not when death was truly staring
us in the face. He wouldn't listen, he wouldn't let go, not after I
lied the first time. Maybe he wasn't so stupid that first time--maybe
I was the fool. If I had meant my promises and kept them the first
time, when he let me go.. we'd both still be alive, and we'd both be
stronger than ever. And maybe Kakarott would have listened to me, if
he'd learned that I could be trusted and knew what I was talking
about. Instead, I used my promises as a momentary trick, to throw him
down and go for the kill--a kill I didn't really want to make.
Damn. I am a fool.
<p>
The pain's gone. Now what?
<p>
Bardock re-appeared in another burst of smoke and looked at Raditz
thoughtfully.  "It gets better, Raditz. Kami, the Spirit Guardian of
Earth, has taken Kakarott under his protection, and received
permission from King Yama to send him on a spirit quest. Kami intends
to return him to mortal life after Kakarott completes his quest--a
quest," Bardock emphasized, "that will bring his power to its fullest
potential--given time. If," Bardock said pointedly, "he completes
it--and I believe he will."
<p>
"How much time?  A.. year?" Raditz asked.
<p>
Will Kakarott be strong enough to fight Nappa and Vegeta both?  Aw,
damn, I hate this! I want Kakarott to win, but not against my Prince!
If he loses, Vegeta will kill him--but to win, Kakarott will have to
kill Vegeta. Damn, damn, damn! I am a complete idiot! If I had been
thinking.. there must have been some other way to handle it back on
Earth, some way that wouldn't have made us enemies. Why couldn't I
have been a clever plotter like Vegeta, or a thinker like father?
<p>
Bardock still watched him. "More than a year, and more than one battle
to realize the fullness of his power, but, to answer the question you
really meant to ask, he may well be powerful enough to fight Prince
Vegeta." He frowned. "And then I will be seeing one or both of them at
King Yama's throne, as I did you and your brother just now. This is
not the way it should have been..." That regret, that shadow of
despair, again.
<p>
Oh great, I hadn't even thought of that. They might kill each other,
like our little mutual suicide just past. And Frieza will have won,
because of my stupidity. Damn. I really hate myself right now. And
yet.. I feel better, somehow. Stronger. What is going on?
<p>
Raditz changed the subject. "Just what do you do here? And why did
King Yama call me 'one of yours'?"
<p>
Bardock half-smiled that peculiarly Saiyan half-smile, half-smirk.
"Four years ago, we rebelled against Frieza, and lost utterly.  He
killed us all, and destroyed Vegetasai beneath us.  You don't see it
yet, do you?  You will.  Four years ago, several million very angry
Saiyan warriors arrived in Hell.  There are uncounted trillions in the
Kingdom of Night, from worlds beyond count, but we are as strong in
spirit as we were in the body.
<p>
"The ancient demons served King Yama, keeping order in the hells,
punishing disobedient spirits and pursuing deserters and fugitives."
Bardock paused to spit in contempt.  "The Demon Guard and their
commander A-nara-oni, were lazy and corrupt by the time we arrived.
They took bribes from sorcerors, they harassed mortals, they ignored
their duties--they were useless and arrogant, because no one dared
challenge the demons of the underworld."
<p>
"And then everyone but me, Nappa and Vegeta got here," Raditz prompted.
<p>
"And Kakarott." Bardock added, "We were dead, and angry, and we are
what we are--Saiyan warriors.  Violent, brutal killers all, and
consigned to this hell--but justice was due." He turned stern. "Those
we had killed had their justice, for we died the same death we'd dealt
to others.  Not death--that was just--but the betrayal--that was the
injustice.  We claimed--we still claim!--the rightful anger of a
people who had served faithfully only to be betrayed."
<p>
This hell?  I was hoping I'd misunderstood that part of Yama's
judgement. On the other hand.. we're all here. I'm not an exile
anymore.
<p>
"The demons thought we would cower and bow to them just like all the
other condemned spirits of this place."  Bardock smirked in the Saiyan
way. "Fools!  We did not.. react well.  You could say we 'went ape'."
<p>
Raditz's jaw dropped.  "But how?  There is no moon here.." he trailed off as
he saw the glow emanating from Bardock's cupped hand.  The light wasn't
intense enough to trigger the change, but he could feel its thrill
running through him. "Oh. Right".
<p>
Bardock extinguished the ki ball. "Physical limitations mean very
little here, as you will learn. Spirit, ki, character is your
strength, ALL of your strength in this realm. We didn't need to become
ouzaru to defeat the demons, but it helped in the long run--demons
have shallow minds and are easily impressed by large hairy monsters
that can pile-drive them into the ground with a single punch.  You
have to beat them a lot harder and longer in your normal form to force
them to respect you. "
<p>
They gave us attitude, we beat them up, they're easily impressed. I
got that part--but what the hell do you mean by the rest of it? This
must be one of those things I need to learn...
<p>
"So you beat up the demons, and wrecked everything in sight--then
what?"
<p>
"King Yama was not pleased that his demons had been thoroughly beaten
and humiliated, but he had been even less pleased with their blatant
corruption for centuries.  Too bad! No one else wanted to do the job
of keeping order in the hells, so King Yama endured it until something
should turn up."
<p>
Raditz started laugh. He couldn't help it! "And then we Saiyans turned
up!  This is unbelievable!  We wrecked Hell??"
<p>
Bardock smiled. "King Yama ruled that since we had defeated the
demons, we should do the job they had failed so badly to do, provided
that we rebuilt the Duke of this hell's palace--"
<p>
"--I thought the place looked vaguely familiar!" This IS the Royal
Guard barracks! I was not imagining things.
<p>
"--and that one of us defeated A-nara-oni, in single combat." Bardock
half-smiled, "A-nara-oni was the terror of the hells and countless
mortal worlds; Orcus, Demonicus Rex, Devourer of Kings, Corrupter of
Saints, Who picks his teeth with Heroes' Bones, the Unconquerable,
etc, etc, etc."
<p>
Damn, this is good!  Too bad Vegeta can't hear THIS over my
scouter--hey, no scouter!  Now why is that?  So the original is still
back wherever on my corpse--now that's a creepy thought--I've got
armor just like before--minus the big ugly hole--why not the scouter?
I still don't get this place. (A sudden flash of a nice-looking
blue-haired human woman holding his scouter and tinkering with it).
<p>
Hey! Where'd that come from? Good-looking babe--hmmm, she's the one
that was on that island with Kakarott's friends.  His wife, maybe? No,
she didn't act like the kid was hers. Hello, Raditz! See pretty girl,
have attention-span of butterfly. I thought I stopped doing that
when.. when all the pretty girls died. Grief is the one mortal wound
that doesn't make a saiyan stronger.  Does death?
<p>
Damn it! My mood swings are getting worse than Vegeta's! Stop it! I'm
dead, I'm in hell, my father thinks I'm scum and he's pretty much
right, I may be single-handedly responsible for extinction of my
entire race--I have absolutely nothing left to be proud of. So much
for Saiyan pride. I think I've hit bottom here; it can only get
better. Now, father was telling me about this demon lord...
<p>
"Well, you're here, so who defeated this bad boy?" Raditz queried.
<p>
His father mused, "Demons are so predictable, they always believe
their own boasts.  It's a bad mistake to make."
<p>
Useful tip. Remember this-- 'cause I did the same damn thing!
<p>
Bardock looked at his son and grinned wolfishly. "My son, you have the
honor of speaking to Commander Bardock of the Saiyan Demon Guard,
Lord-General of the Legions of Hell."
<p>
Raditz started as a sheathed katana fell at his feet. He turned
slowly; they were there, behind him, grinning. His cousin Turles,
broad-shouldered and arrogant as ever; slender, saturnine Ran Mara;
King's man Zorn, and the rest of his old comrades from the Royal
Guard--Guardsmen once again.  Each of them wore a sheathed katana at
his side.  Turles, the squad leader, saluted him twice--first, the
traditional farewell salute to a fallen warrior, and second, the
traditional greeting of one Guardsman to another.
<p>
"Welcome to hell, warrior. Welcome home."
<p>
