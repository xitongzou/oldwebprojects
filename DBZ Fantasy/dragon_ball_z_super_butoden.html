----------------------------Super Butoden----------------------------

Welcome!  I am Vegita, Guardian Of Destiny, and I see you want help for the
Super Famicom game "Dragon Ball Z: Super Butoden".  Well, you've come to the
right place, because this game is my speciality.  I have owned it for quite
some time now, and am quite proficient at it.  When I first started writing
FAQs, I told myself that at one point I'd like to write a FAQ for every Dragon
Ball game in existance.  I am now making good on my work, as I have decided to
write a FAQ for this game.

First off, let's get one thing straight: Even though I am Vegita, I will try to
write from an un-biased point of view (although I still think I'm the best at
everything).  Second of all, if I catch anyone copying all or part of this FAQ,
ANY part of this FAQ (not counting little sentences like "First off, let's get
one thing straight), I will destroy you.  I will rip you limb from limb like
the excessively weak individual you are, and then I will sue you for copyright
infringment.  Third of all, I do not own the rights to this game, the names of
the characters in this game or FAQ, or have any ownership whatsoever of this
game (except for the cartridge sitting in my room, that is).  Those are the
property of their respective owners.


----------------------------Super Butoden----------------------------
     ----------------------II:  Game Story----------------------
----------------------------Super Butoden----------------------------

Dragon Ball was a Manga (Japanese cartoon or comic) created by Akira Toriyama,
an artist in Japan, in 1982.  The manga, which dealt with an absurdly strong
little boy named Gokuu (off of the Japanese stories of a monkey god of the same
name), became wildly successful, and a cartoon version was put on the air in
1984.  It ran all through the course of the show until the main character,
Gokuu, finally grew to adulthood.  This signified the end of Dragon Ball, but
promised that something new would return next week in it's place.  This new
show: Dragon Ball Z.

Dragon Ball Z picked up right where Dragon Ball left off, with Gokuu as an
adult.  He has a child now, and his arch-nemesis, Piccolo, was as bad and mean
as ever.  This series introduced an entirely new set of characters, mostly from
outer space, and revealed Gokuu's origins (he's from another planet too).

Dragon Ball was such a large success, before and during it's "Z" stage, so it
was obvious enough that there would be video games made about it.   There are
RPGs, Fighting games, Strategy games, and even a few arcade games.  This is
where Super Butoden comes in.

Super Butoden plot starts off at the climatic Final Round of the 23rd
Tenkai-Ichi Boudokai, where Gokuu faced off against his (then) Arch-Rival,
Piccolo.  The game then progresses throughout most of the series, pitting you
against key characters, leading up to the final battle against Perfect Cell. 
Against each character, you are given certain characters to fight as depending
on whom you have befriended in the story (thus far) and who is still alive.


----------------------------Super Butoden----------------------------
     ------------------------III: Basics------------------------
----------------------------Super Butoden----------------------------

To begin the game, insert the cartridge into your Super Famicom (or modified
Super NES) console, and press the power button.  If you're running it off of an
emulator, you're a pansy, and should get the actual game (just kidding...but I
do highly suggest you get the actual game itself).  After the intro sequence
(you can skip it if you want to), press start at the title screen to bring up
the menu.


------------------------------------------
---III-A: The Menu Screen/Modes of Play---
------------------------------------------

>From here you are given 4 selections:

Story Mode     Tenkai-Ichi Boudokai Mode
Options        Multiplayer

-----Story Mode-----
The Story Mode is where you progress through the story.  You can only select
characters that join the Z Team, and you automatically fight the next character
in the storyline progression.

-----Tenkai-Ichi Boudokai-----
The Tenkai-Ichi Boudokai Mode is where you (and a 2nd player, if you wish) join
in a Tournament Fight.  Your characters are put in brackets (8 fighters total)
and duke it out.  The 4 Winners of the Quarter-Finals go into the Semi-Finals,
with the 2 Winners of the Semi-Finals fighting in the Final Round.  The winner
is crowned king (or queen) of the Boudokai.

-----Options-----
There are 3 screens of Options to choose from.

###Screen 1###
Punch Button       - Select this if you wish to change which button
                     causes your character to Punch (default = Y
                     BUTTON).
Kick Button        - Select this if you wish to change which button
                     causes your character to Kick (default = B
                     BUTTON).
Switch Button      - Select this if you wish to change which button
                     causes your character to Switch (default = X
                     BUTTON).
Ki Button          - Select this if you wish to change which button
                     causes your character to fire Ki blasts (default =
                     A BUTTON).
Left Dash Button   - Select this if you wish to change which button
                     causes your character to Dash towards the Left
                     (default = L BUTTON).
Right Dash Button  - Select this if you wish to change which button
                     causes your character to Dash towards the Right
                     (default = R BUTTON).

###Screen 2###
Continues          - This option allows you to change how many
                     continues you get in the Story Mode.
Sound              - This option allows you to toggle the Sound mode
                     between Stereo and Monoraul.
Slow Motion        - This option allows you to toggle Slow Motion on
                     and off.
Visual Life/Ki     - This option allows you to toggle whether or not
                     you can see the Life and Ki Bars at the top of the
                     screen.  Personally, I can't see why you would
                     turn them off, but that's just me...
Visual Radar       - Just like the Visual Life/Ki Option, this Option
                     toggles whether or not you can see the Radar at
                     the top of the screen.  Yeesh, man, if you can't
                     see how much life they've got at LEAST be able to
                     find them!

###Screen 3###
Difficulty         - This option allows you to switch the Difficulty
                     Level from 1 to 4, 1 being the easiest and 4 being
                     the hardest.
Easy Ki Blast Mode - This option allows the you to switch your
                     character from normal to "Easy Special Mode" (1
                     for OFF, 2 for ON).  When this option is ON, your
                     character will automatically use the strongest Ki
                     attack they can based off of how much energy is in
                     their Ki bar.  If there is enough (and they are at
                     the proper range), they will even use Super Ki
                     Blasts.  When this option is OFF, you have to
                     manually perform each Ki attack.
Super Ki Defenses  - This option allows you to toggle whether or not
                     you can defend against Super Ki blasts or not.
                     When this is off, your character will always take
                     the full amount of damage from each blast.  When
                     it is on, you can attempt the usual defenses
                     against Super Ki blasts.
Music Catalog      - This option allows you to scroll through all the
                     music in the game and play them.
Sound Catalog      - This option allows you to scroll through all the
                     various sounds in the game and listen to them.

-----Multiplayer-----
The Multiplayer mode allows you (and a 2nd player, if you choose) to pick your
characters and fight.  After picking your characters, a menu screen is brought
up with various options you may pick from that affect the upcoming battle.

-------------------------
|                       |
|   [ ] 1      2 [ ]    |
| Player 1     Player 2 |
|                       |
|3           7  --- 8   |
|4           9  --- 10  |
|5           11 --- 12  |   <---  Look!  Bad Ascii art!
|6           13 --- 14  |
|                       |
-------------------------

1  = Player 1's character and character picture.
2  = Player 2's character and character picture.
3  = Difficulty.  If you opted to play versus a Computer opponent, this
     will allow you to change the difficulty of the Computer-Controller
     player.  As with in the Options Menu, there are 4 Difficulty
     Settings, 1 being the Easiest and 4 being the Hardest.
4  = Level Select.  This option allows you to change the level you
     fight in.
5  = Background Music.  This option allows you to change the Music
     playing during your fight.
6  = Begin Match.  After picking all of your options, select this to
     being the match.
7  = Player 1's Life Bar Handicap.  The number next to this option
     reflects Player 1's Life Handicap.  Change as you wish, giving
     your player anywhere from 50% to 200% Life.
8  = Player 2's Life Bar Handicap.  See #7.
9  = Player 1's Ki Bar Handicap.  The Number next to this option
     reflects Player 1's starting amount of Ki in their Ki Bar.  You
     can start off with 0% or boost it all the way up to 100% right
     from the start.
10 = Player 2's Ki Bar Handicap.  See #9.
11 = Player 1's Easy Ki Blast Mode.  This option allows you to turn
     Off/On Player 1's Easy Ki Blast Mode.
12 = Player 2's Easy Ki Blast Mode.  See #11.
13 = Player 1's Super Ki Defenses.  This option allows you to toggle
     whether or not Player 2 can defend against Super Ki blasts.
14 = Player 2's Super Ki Defenses.  See #13.


---------------------------
---III-B: Basic Controls---
---------------------------

Here are the basic attacks and movements that every character can utilize.  If
you don't know how to do any of these, you should learn how immediately.

A BUTTON      = Ki blast.   This is your typical Ki attack.  Most
                characters throw a small blast, while others launch
                something different.
B BUTTON      = Kick.  This button causes your character to throw a
                kick.
X BUTTON      = Switch.  This button causes your character to switch
                from the ground, where you stand and fight, to the Sky
                Area, where you float and fight.  Keep in mind that
                you can only move from the Sky Area to the Ground (and
                vice versa) when the 2 fighters are far enough away
                that the screen splits.  If you try to do so when
                there is no split, nothing will happen.
Y BUTTON      = Punch.  This button causes your character to throw a
                punch.
L/R BUTTONS   = Holding down either the L or R BUTTON will cause your
                character to dash.
START         = This pauses and unpauses the game.
SELECT        = Once the game is paused, pressing SELECT will take you
                to the menu screen, where you can browse through each
                characters' moves, reconfigure the buttons, etc.

UP            = Jump.  This causes your character to jump up in the
                air.  Characters can also jump UP-TOWARDS and UP-AWAY.
                NOTE - when in the Aerial Fighting Plane, your
                characters don't really "jump", they float up and
                down.  This is due to the fact that your characters
                are, through either the use of their Ki or repulsors
                jets, floating in the air, and in order to "jump"
                they have to temporarily increase the amount of energy
                devoted to "floating", so that they can quickly rise
                up and fall back to their original level.  See, physics
                DOES have its place in cheesy Japanese Fighting Series'!
DOWN (Ground) = Crouch.  This causes your character to duck.  While
                this is seemingly useless, some of the shorter
                characters can dodge quite a few attacks by ducking.
                Every character only drops about 1 head in length, but
                for those smaller characters that 1 head of room is
                enough (Gohan, #18).
DOWN (Air)    = Quick Charge.  This is the only way to effectively
                charge Ki in this game (other than blocking attacks).
                When your character is in the air and you press down,
                you'll find that you are inable to duck.  Instead,
                your character will remain motionless, drawing in
                energy.  When doing so, their Ki bar will charge up
                twice as fast as the normal rate.  This is good if
                you're low on energy and need it for a power attack
                or barrage of lesser blasts.
TOWARDS/AWAY  = Press the directional pad LEFT or RIGHT, which ever
                direction is towards your opponent.  Since, thoughout
                the course of the fight, your characters will (most
                likely) switch sides, the direction you must press for
                certain moves will switch from LEFT to RIGHT (and vice
                versa).  Therefore, to save time and effort I simply
                say TOWARDS and AWAY.
AWAY         =  BLOCK (usually).  If you hold AWAY from your opponent
                while they are attacking, you will block at a mid
                level.  If you hold DOWN-AWAY, your character will block
                at a low level.  If you hold AWAY and your opponent is
                not attacking, you will walk (or float) in that
                direction.  However, if you block Ki blasts or special
                attacks, you will still sustain minor damage.  Don't be
                a turtle - come out and attack once in a while!

-             = When I list certain directions that are hyphenated,
                such as "DOWN-AWAY", that means you press both
                directions at the same time.  This means that the move
                is a diagonal.
+             = When I list directional movements with a +, that means
                that the button is pressed at the same time as the
                direction indicated.  In other words, if you see "Away
                + A Button" that means you would press AWAY and the A
                BUTTON at the same time.  I use the Hyphen (+) and the
                Plus (+) both for continuity - one is used for
                directions, while the other is used for buttons.
,             = When I list commas in between moves, that means you
                must press the direction and/or button, then press the
                next direction/button, etc.  If you see "Away, Down,
                Towards", that means you would press AWAY, then DOWN,
                then TOWARDS.

---NOTE---
You don't have to press the Direction and/or button, then release, then press
the next command.  In fact, it often works better if you perform the movements
in one fluid motion.  This can be easily accomplished by rolling one's thumb
across the Directional Pad.  This game allows some leeway in performing each
move, so if you are required to press "Away, Down + A" but press "Away,
Away-Down, Down +A" through rolling of the thumb, the game will still register
the move as "Away, Down + A".  I list the bare minimum you HAVE to press in
order for the moves to work.  If you feel that you could perform the move
better by rolling, then by all means do so.  Also, if you're having trouble
getting an attack to work, trying jumping, then doing the motion right as you
land.  Your character will be more likely to do the attack.


-----------------------------
---III-C: More Information---
-----------------------------

How to play the game is rather simple.  After picking your character, you will
go into a 1 on 1 fight with your opponent (be it the computer or another
player).  Both players have a Life Bar at the top of the screen, as well as a
separate Ki Bar below it (used for individual Ki attacks, outlined in the Moves
section).  Everyone can move around using the Directional Pad and attack using
the A, B, X, Y, L, and R Buttons (outlined in the Controls section).  Every
time you successfully hit your opponent with an attack, they lose a portion of
their Life Bar.  In order to win, you must be the first person to drain the
other player of all their Life Bar.  Certain moves do more damage than others,
so learn which attacks are quickest, which attacks are do the most damage, and
how you can use those effectively against your opponent.  It's whoever does the
most damage first, so make sure that's you!

----------

You can win the game off of just the basic attacks, but if you want to actually
win against an opponent with some skill, you should learn these attacks as
well.

---Aerial Movement---
In the game, if you switch to the upper level, you will be flying around
instead of standing.  This means that you cannot duck low attacks, but you are
able to slowly glide up and down over attacks by "jumping" (in the air, you're
not really jumping).  You can, however, throw Ki attacks (regular attacks,
specials, supers), and they will automatically travel to the lower playing
field to seek out your opponent (unless they're on the same level as you). 
When in the Sky Area, it can be very hard to dodge certain attacks, while other
attacks are even easier to dodge and counter.  Learn to use whatever works best
for your character.

---Regular Ki Blasts---
Unlike other fighting games, this one did not use several buttons for varying
punch or kick attacks.  Instead, there is only 1 button for a kick, 1 button
for a punch, 2 buttons for dashing Left/Right, 1 button for flight, and 1
button for throwing a Ki blast.  That's right - each character has a projectile
as a standard attack.  However, don't think this is the end-all solution to the
game.  In fact, you'll find that a regular Ki blast won't do near as much
damage as simply getting in close and slugging it out.  Also, if you do nothing
but throw Ki blasts, you'll notice that your character will stop and take a
breather.  Don't go nuts with these, they're just another attack.  If you abuse
it, you'll lose.  Note:  #16 and #18 cannot get tired from throwing Ki blasts. 
THEY can go nuts with Ki blasts.

---Special Ki Blasts---
Each character has more than just the regular Ki blast.  Your more powerful Ki
attacks use segments of the Ki Bar - the more Ki required, the stronger the
attack (and the more damage it does).  You can't perform a certain Ki attack
unless you have enough Ki to use it, and the only way to charge up Ki is to
either sit and wait for your Ki to charge up, or to block attacks.  Frankly, I
don't like the idea of gaining energy by allowing my enemy to pound on me, but
I didn't design the game...

---Radar---
Having trouble finding your opponent?  Well, that's ok - this game is equipped
with a radar system.  The system is based around the Dragon Ball ability to
sense others by feeling their Ki.  This extrodinary ability translates into the
game via a small cube representing each character, located directly below the
Ki Bar.  With the radar, you can see where your character is in relation to the
other character, as well as Ki blasts that might be thrown.  However, since
#16, #18, and #20 do not have any Ki, they don't appear on the Radar*.  Good
luck dealing with these menaces.

---Stunned Opponents---
If you wail on your opponent enough, they may become stunned.  When this
happens, the are rendered unable to move, attack, or defend - they are forced
to catch their breath.  After a few seconds (or being hit), they will be
knocked out of it.  However, until then they are open game to whatever you wish
to hit them with unabated, including Supre Ki Blasts!


* = they only appear on the Radar in Multiplayer and the Boudokai mode.


----------------------------Super Butoden----------------------------
     ----------------IV: Super Ki Blast Defenses----------------
----------------------------Super Butoden----------------------------

Well, Mr. Hot Shot, here's you think you're all that and a loaf of rye now that
you've mastered the basics of the game, huh?  Well, let's see what happens when
someone lets loose with an insanely-poweful Ki blast.  What are you going to do
THEN, huh Mr. Smarty Pants?  I believe this is where I tell you what to do.

Most every character has 2 super Ki blasts: a weaker one (that takes roughly
1/4th the Ki bar), and a stronger one (that takes 1/3-1/2 the Ki bar).  These
can only be used if you are far enough away from your opponent for your
character to initiate the attack - if you aren't far enough away, then the
attack will not proceed.  When you DO perform the attack, your character will
go a through special animation of the movements prior to the attack, then the
standard throwing of said Ki blast.  At this point, the screen will switch over
to the other character, who must attempt to block or dodge the attack (or take
it full-on, but this isn't suggested).  You'll obviously want to know how The
trick to performing each Defense is that you have to perform the move right as
your character "flinches", or slightly moves.  Once they do, input the move of
your choice.  Here's how:

---1:  Simple Block = Away + A.  By pressing AWAY and A , your character will
throw up their arms in defense, blocking the brunt of the attack.  You take
half the normal amount of damage this way.

---2:  Dodge = Up, Down + A.  Pressing UP, then DOWN and A will cause your
character to lean to the side and allow the attack to shoot past, bearly
brushing against them.  This will cause them to take only 1/4 the normal amount
of damage.

---3:  Deflection = Away, Down, Towards + A.  Rolling AWAY to DOWN to TOWARDS
and pressing A will make your character reflect the attack back at the
attacker.  No damage is done to you, and the other guy can only attempt to
block or dodge.

---4:  Reflection = Away, Down + A.  Rolling from AWAY to DOWN and pressing A
will make your character bat draw in the attack, trying to control it enough to
reflect it away.  If you succeed, your character will "throw" the attack away,
taking no damage.  However, sometimes it will explode in your face, causing the
full amount of damage.  In Piccolo's case, it will blow one of his arms off,
forcing him to regrow it before continuing the battle!

---5:  Dispersion = Away, Towards + A.  By pressing AWAY, then TOWARDS and A
will cause your character to destroy the attack, with no damage done.  This is
what'll usually happen when you attempt a Deflection, though.  However, this
attack is actually fairly easy to do, and does no damage to use, so I suggest
you abuse this whenever you come across a Blast-Happy opponent.

Also, Artificial Humans 18 and 20 have special Ki Defenses of their own:

---Dr. Gero/Artificial Human # 20's Energy Drain - Up + A.  As seen in the
Manga (and the show), Dr. Gero/# 20 can absorb energy through small reticles in
the palms of his hands.  If someone launches a Super Ki Blast at him, I highly
suggest you not even bother using any other defenses, as this one takes no
energy and absorbs the blast, turning it into life for the Doctor.  Come on, it
doesn't get much better than THAT!

---# 18's, Impenetrable Shield - Up + A.  # 18's defensive shield from the
manga/anime is in the game as well.  Upon launching of a Super Blast, # 18 can
erect a shield around her that completely protects her from the blast.  This is
the equivalent of the Dispersion defense, except for the fact that instead of
dispersing the attack, #18 simply smiles, flips her hair, and watches as her
opponent wastes their time with a blast.


---Note---
If your character is stunned and your opponent launches a Super Ki blast, you
CANNOT defend against it in any way.  That's right, they're forced to take the
hit.  If you can pull it off, stun your opponent!

---------- Long Move List (by Character) ----------
    -------------------------------------------
               ---------------------


Each special attack is rated on a 1-10 scale, the first 5 (1-5) for how easy it
is to get it to work, the second 5 (6-10) for effectiveness.  If an attack is
really easy to do, and does very little damage or just plain misses a lot, then
it'll rank a 6.  If it is impossible to pull off, yet is unblockable and does
massive damage, it'll get a 6 for different reasons.  Also, some attacks go off
of the scale, achieving a 6 in either effectiveness or difficulty.  These moves
go beyond my opinion of the "perfect attack", meaning that the particular
attack is unbelieveably useful (usually because of several different
factors/abilities the move has).

-All these attacks were taken from the attack list in the game, which is
accessed during a fight by pressing start, then select.  If there is an attack
that does not appear on the move list but does appear on my list, it is
probably a "secret" move for that character.  Relish in your extra ability!  Oh
yeah, and if you come across any moves I forgot, please e-mail me with it. 
I'll verify it and add it to the FAQ!


---Special Note/Question---

Now, does it really make sense for certain characters' stronger Ki blast to be
a disjoined attack instead of a connected energy beam?  Allow me to make an
analogy so you can understand my reasoning - suppose you have the option of
choosing between using a water hose to shoot water at someone, or to "charge
up" a water balloon full of water and throw it.  Granted, when you throw the
water balloon you'll have better accuracy since you won't have to worry about
swinging the stream of water (energy) around, but there's no WAY it could
possibly dump out as much water, for the same amount of energy, as the stream
of water from the hose.  With Trunks' Finishing Buster (or Piccolo's
Mankaksopoppo, as well as any other "connected" ki attack), he can continue to
dump energy into it, thus overriding any other attacks attempting to defeat it.
 Because Trunks is controlling the giant beam by, essentially, a ball at the
end of a long string, he has less control but more power to it.  The Burning
Attack is a giant ball that he has more control over, but unless he spent a
LARGE amount of time dumping more energy into the attack (which would take a
lot of time and effort), it simply isn't going to be as powerful as the
Connected Blast.  I guess all I'm whining about is the fact that the
programmers decided to make the wrong attack the more powerful one, thus
showing that they didn't really understand the basics of physics or watch the
show that much.


--------------------
---V-B: Son Gokuu---
--------------------

Gokuu is the main character Dragon Ball.  The story revolves around his growing
up, eventually becoming the ultimate fighting champion of the universe.  From
the beginning, where Gokuu was a mere child (and a martial arts prodigy),
Dragon Ball has watched him grow and mature into an adult.  He has dealt with
powerful fighters, meglomaniacal shoguns, assassins, ace martial artists, and
even the devil and his minions.  Throughout it all, Gokuu has grown in strength
and fighting wisdom, eventually becoming the fighter he is today.

Super Butoden begins with one of the major fights of Gokuu's life, during the
final match of the 23 Tenkai-Ichi Boudokai against "Ma Junior", Piccolo
Daimou's offspring.  Gokuu, 3 years prior, had killed the Devil in a massive
battle, then went to train with Kami (God) to prepare for the fight against
Piccolo Jr.  From there, the game chronicals the storyline through fights with
individual characters, culminating in the Gokuu's defeat by Cell and Gohan's
rise to hero-dom.  Gokuu is the main person you will use throughout the game,
being the first person you use and one of the few that stays with you the
entire time.  He is also the only person in the game (other than Mr. Satan)
whom you don't fight in the Story mode.  He wears an Orange Gi (Uniform), and
has wild black hair with a flattened area (where he fell on his head as a
child).

---Move list---

DOWN, TOWARDS + B (while in air)  = Dive Kick.  By performing this motion while
in air, Gokuu will dive downwards diagonally, with his foot extended.  This
makes for a good surprise attack, as you can hop into the air and immediately
use it.  It also makes for a good counter-tactic, useful for countering Ki
blasts and such.  However, I feel that its best use is when you're using it as
an escape - jump up and dash over your opponent, clearing any attacks they
might be throwing at you!  8/10 (4/5 x 2)

AWAY-DOWN, UP-TOWARDS + B = Arrow Knee.  Gokuu flies diagonally upwards with
his knee extended.  He will then fly forward a little, then touch back down on
the ground.  This move is fast and does decent damage, so it's great as an
Anti-Air.  However, if it is blocked or missed, you're wide open for all sorts
of punishment, so be careful when using it.  7/10 (3/5, 4/5)

DOWN, AWAY + Y = Backstep Elbow.  Gokuu slides backwards on the ground, then
rushes forward with his elbow extended.  This is a good move when you want to
throw off your enemies who come in for a quick combo.  Think of it as a
defensive move more than an offensive move, as that's pretty much all you
should use it for.  The main reason this attack should be used as a defensive
move is because while Gokuu is sliding backwards, he is invulnerable to attacks
- they'll just pass right through him.  While the attack itself isn't overly
poweful, it is still a lot of fun to watch your opponent go sailing across the
screen.  The reason for this is because the attack, instead of being a regular
hit, is actually what is referred to as a "knockback" attack.  What this means
is that the attack will send your opponent flying a good distance upon
connecting.  8/10 (5/5, 3/5)

DOWN (charge for 2 seconds), UP + A = Kai-oh Ken.  Using the technique taught
to him by Kai-oh Sama, Gokuu increases his power and speed through the use of
Kai-oh Ken.  This technique is EXTREMELY useful, making Gokuu jump higher, move
faster, and hit harder.  The only problem with the attack is that it IS rather
difficult to pull off.  Charge up with Kai-oh Ken and start smacking around the
opposition!  7/10 (1/5, 6/5)  <--  That's right, I put a 6/5.  It's off the
scale!

DOWN, TOWARDS + A = Seeking Genki Tama.  Gokuu holds his hands above his head,
charging up a small Genki Tama.  He then releases it, which flies out and seeks
its enemy.  This attack is useful in the fact that it seeks out its target,
making it difficult to avoid the attack.  However, the attack itself has an
incredibly-long start up, and the attack can be nullified by a regular ol' Ki
blast.  Word of advice - unless you're being REALLY cocky (or really stupid),
don't even bother with this attack.  6/10 (5/5, 1/5)

AWAY, DOWN, TOWARDS, UP + B = Super Meteo Bashing.  Gokuu kicks his enemy up
into the air, hammers them back to the ground, then elbows them off to the
side.  The damage this move does is phoenominal, but it's very difficult to
pull off.  When you actually connect with this attack, though, you'll find
yourself doing more damage than Gokuu's Kamehame-ha!  Now THAT'S powerful. 
6/10 (2/5, 4/5)

% DOWN, AWAY, TOWARDS + A = Kamehame-ha.  Gokuu charges up Kamesennin's
trademark attack, the Kamehame-ha, then launches it at his opponent.  This is
Gokuu's weaker Super Ki Blast, meaning that it does a fair amount of damage
(30%-50% of a single life bar) while only taking 25% the Ki bar.  Nice,
efficient damage.  6/10 (3/5 x 2)

%% TOWARDS, DOWN, AWAY + A = Chou Genki Tama.  Gokuu charges up a large Genki
Tama (about as big as he is), then launches it at his enemy.  This is Gokuu's
stronger Super Ki Blast, meaning that it does a very good amount of damage (75%
of a single life bar) while costing of his own 50% the Ki bar.  Sure, it takes
twice as much Ki as a Kamehame-ha and does less than twice as much damage, but
the odds are greater that, with the 2 separate attacks, one of them will be
dodged/blocked/reflected.  Therefore, the odds are in your favor with the one
giant blast rather than several weaker ones...of course, your odds are even
greater that you could do just as much damage in less time with regular
attacks, but never neglect these attacks.  The could be the difference between
a match won and a match lost.  8/10 (4/5 x 2)

---Overall---
Gokuu's strategies are varied - he can play a ground game, an air game, an
anti-air game, whatever.  He really isn't that great a player until you realize
the full potential of his Kai-oh Ken power up.  His abilities go up greatly,
making every mistake your opponent creates that much more damaging.  Gokuu's
keep-away isn't the best in the game, nor is his in-fighting, so mix up your
strategies until you have a safe chance to power up and dish the damage out.


------------------
---V-C: Piccolo---
------------------

Piccolo is Gokuu's oldest rival (unless you count Kuririn or Yamcha).  His
father was Piccolo Daimou, the evil incarnate that was released when Kami
(Earth's God) ascended to Godhood - in order to do so, he had to purge his body
of all evil.    When Gokuu finally killed Piccolo Daimou, he vowed his revenge,
and spit out an egg with the present Piccolo in it.  This Piccolo has fought
alongside and against Gokuu, but has played an even more important role in
Gohan's life.  As Gohan's fighting trainer, he instilled a fighting sense into
Gohan.  He even began to care for the little tyke.  After a while, Piccolo gave
up on the whole rivalry.  Being a Namekian, Piccolo has the ability to
regenerate lost limbs, extend body parts great distances, and use magical
powers.  Piccolo is the first person you fight in Story Mode.  Piccolo is a
large Green Namekian, wearing a Purple Gi (uniform).

---Move list---

DOWN, TOWARDS + B (while in air)  = Dive Kick.  By performing this motion while
in air, Piccolo (just like Gokuu) will dive downwards diagonally, with his foot
extended.  This makes for a good surprise attack, as you can hop into the air
and immediately use it, or even hop backwards and use it.  It also makes for a
good counter-tactic, useful for countering Ki blasts and such.  8/10 (4/5 x 2)

TOWARDS, AWAY, TOWARDS + B = Sliding Retort Kick.  Piccolo quickly flies
horizontally (about 1/2 a screen's length) with his foot extended, then
returns.  This is a nice, quick, 1-2 combo, which can be used as a finisher for
a variety of combos.  A quick Jump Kick, Standing Kick, Retort Kick will easily
devastate your opponent.  7/10 (4/5, 3/5)

TOWARDS, DOWN, AWAY + B = Mystic Combo.  [This move is unlisted in the Options
menu, so don't expect to see it there.]  Piccolo, using his Namekian abilities,
stretches his arm out to a decent-sized length, grabs his opponent, drags them
in, and kicks them across the screen.  This move, while not terribly powerful,
is fairly effective if you want to get those pesky close-range fighters out of
the way.  As you can probably guess, the attack has the Knockback feature
rather than a regular hit (although the extended arm connecting does minor
damage as well).  7/10 (4/5, 3/5)

AWAY, TOWARDS + A = Eyebeams.  We all remember how Piccolo trained Gohan to
dodge attacks quickly (prior to the arrival of Nappa and Vegita), right?  Wel,
here's that move, ready for you to use!  Piccolo doesn't do any special motions
or anything, he simply launches a quick laser blast from his eyes!  While the
move is easy to do and easy to use, the range is pathetic (roughly 1 screen
distance).  However, its' speed can easily make it a counter-Ki maneuver.  If
you see a Ki blast coming for you, Eyeblast them!  9/10 (4/5, 5/5)

DOWN, TOWARDS + A = Seeking Ki Blast.  Just like Gokuu's Mini-Genki Tama,
Piccolo can throw out a small, seeking Orb.  The difference between the two is
that Piccolo's orb has practically no start up and no lag, so you can worry
less about being caught off-guard when using it.  Abuse it, especially when you
want to try and trap your opponent (throw out a Seeking Ki blast, switch to the
Sky, dash past them, switch back down to the ground, and rush them from the
other side).  10/10 (5/5 x 2)

% AWAY, DOWN, TOWARDS + A = Mankaksopoppo.  Piccolo's trademark attack in which
he charges up energy by placing his fingers to his forehead, then releases that
energy in a Screw-type blast, drilling through his enemies.  This is Piccolo's
weaker Super Ki Blast, meaning that it does a fair amount of damage (30%-50% of
a single life bar) while only taking 25% the Ki bar.  Nice, efficient damage. 
7/10 (4/5, 3/5)

%% TOWARDS, DOWN, AWAY + A = Gekiretsudokan.  Piccolo charges up so much energy
into 1 arm that he has to use the other arm to steady it.  He then launches the
massive blast from an open palm at his enemy.  This is Piccolo's stronger Super
Ki Blast, meaning that it does a very good amount of damage (75% of a single
life bar) while taking 50% the Ki bar.  8/10 (4/5 x 2)

---Overall---
Piccolo is great when it comes to in-close fighting.  He has the moves to
prevent an enemy from getting in, while attacking without putting himself in
danger.  Sure, he as some token "range" moves, but I think these should only be
used for preventing the enemy from getting in close while assuring an opening
for yourself.  Remember - while Piccolo is great when it comes to fighting
up-close, there are those that are better.  Don't give these people an opening!
 If you have to, fake an opening and make them screw up, so you can punish
them.


-----------------
---V-D: Vegita---
-----------------

Vegita is the archrival of Gokuu.  Gokuu, 4 years after being married and
fathering Gohan, he had a rude awakening - he isn't an Earthling at all, but
rather from a race of Space Mercenaries called "Saiya-Jins".  He was informed
of this by his super-powerful brother, Raditz.  Gokuu and Piccolo teamed up
against Raditz in an effort to save the Earth.  During the fight, Gokuu and
Piccolo talked of the Dragon Balls, the mystic orbs that could grant a wish to
the person who collected them all.  Raditz, who had a communicator on him, was
able to transmit this information to the Prince of all Saiya-Jins, Vegita. 
Vegita, intrigued by these Wish-Giving objects, immediately headed to Earth. 
Vegita and Nappa, the General of the Saiya-Jin army, engauged in a massive
fight that resulted in Nappa's death, as well as several of the Z-Senshi. 
Vegita, however, was spared by Gokuu.  Vegita, who's pride couldn't allow this
thing to happen, created a rivalry against Gokuu.  Since then, they have
clashed a few times, but a true winner has yet to be determined...

Vegita has fought along side Gokuu and his friends, and occasionally against. 
He is both friend and foe, and one bad man all around.  He is also the 2nd
person you fight in Story Mode.  Vegita is a Saiya-Jin with black hair going up
into a point, and sports the traditional Saiya-Jin Armor (minus the shoulder
pads) over a blue outfit.

---Move List---

AWAY-DOWN, UP-TOWARDS + B = Handspring Attack.  Vegita springs off of his hands
into the air, hitting anything in his way.  This attack is along the same style
as Gokuu's Arrow Knee, as the movement is the same and Vegita attacks in the
same ilk.  To be perfectly honest, the only difference between the attacks
(aside from the character using it) is the way each attack is done - Vegita
does a handspring, while Gokuu simply jumps with knee extended.  7/10 (3/5,
4/5)

DOWN, TOWARDS + B = Sliding Kick.  Vegita slides forward with his foot
extended, striking low and knocking down his opponent.  This attack comes out
quickly and is easy to chain off of a jump-in, and if your timing is right you
can slide underneath ki blasts (except for heat-seeking shots or certain
specialty blasts).  This attack serves as a "knockdown" attack, meaning that
instead of simply hitting your opponent you knock them down (don't confuse this
with the "knockback" feature, which sends your opponent sprawling).  Now you
can stop an offensive enemy and avoid attacks all at the same time  How
convenient!  10/10 (5/5 x 2)

TOWARDS, AWAY, TOWARDS + Y = Crossing Combination.  Vegita flies foward,
punching and kicking.  The nice thing about this combo is that, even if it's
blocked, Vegita will fly through his opponent, making it very difficult to
punish (you have to know exactly where he's going to be on the other side). 
You can combo this off of a a jump-in, a missed attack, and even catch an enemy
across the screen before they can make a move!  However, there are gaps in
between blows so that your opponent can escape or block the attack.  Still, if
you manage to connect with every hit, you'll lookin' at a LOT of damage and
you'll be safely away before they can do anything.  8/10 (4/5 x 2)

DOWN, AWAY + Y = Backstep Headbutt.   Vegita quickly backflips, landing
gracefully (somewhat) on his feet, then dashes forward with his forehead
extended, looking to make a hit.  Just like Gokuu's Backstep Elbow, Vegita's
move is most effective when you use it as a defensive measure due to the frames
of invincibility and because of the Knockback feature.  8/10 (5/5, 3/5)

DOWN, AWAY + A = Renzoku Energy Dan.  Vegita can fire off 3 Ki blasts in rapid
succession.  If the first one connects, you're pretty well assured that the
following 2 will as well.  This move is easy to use, and has tons of
possibilities attached to it.  If a pesky opponent keeps throwing Ki blasts at
you, retort.  If you see someone throwing a seeking Ki blast, send it off -
you'll either catch them while they're throwing it, or stop the blast AND hit
them several times.  It's an attack that you should abuse every chance you get.
 10/10 (5/5 x 2)

% AWAY, DOWN, TOWARDS + A = Big Bang Attack.  Vegita powers up, then launches a
1-handed blast at his opponent.  This move is one of Vegita's most
commonly-used attacks from Dragon Ball, first used to destroy Artificial Human
# 19.  The Big Bang Attack is Vegita's weaker Super Ki Blast.  30%-50% of 1
bar, 25% Ki.  7/10 (4/5, 3/5)

%% DOWN, AWAY, TOWARDS + A = Final Flash.  Vegita powers up, then launches a
double-palm blast.  This is considered Vegita's trademark attack, despite the
fact that he used it as much as the Big Bang attack (this one's stronger, so I
guess that's what clinched it).  The Final Flash is Vegita's stronger Super Ki
blast.  75% of 1 bar, 50% Ki.  7/10 (3/5, 4/5)

---Overall---
Vegita is an amalgam of Piccolo and Gokuu.  While he lacks the Aerial Dive
Kick, he has Gokuu's Backstep attack and Rising attack, as well as Piccolo's
sliding kick (sans the return kick).  Vegita also has the extremely useful
Renzoku Energy Dan, which automatically gives him an edge in a fight over those
that do not.  His style is geared more towards keeping enemies just past arm's
length.  If they try to get in too close, he can punish them.  If they try to
run away, he can catch them while they're running.  Play Vegita just like that,
and you'll do just fine.


-----------------
---V-E: Furiza---
-----------------

Furiza was the scourge of the universe.  His presence was feared all around
because of his phenominal strength, and the army of minions he commanded.  When
Gokuu and Piccolo had fought against Raditz', they discussed the use of the
Dragon Balls to resurrect one another.  However, Raditz had a small
communications device that was able to pick up the entire conversation. 
Furiza, as well as Vegita, had eavesdropped on the conversation via similar
devices; Vegita immediately headed for Earth, while Furiza headed for the
homeworld of the Namekians, called Namek.  Furiza reasoned that since Kami was
a Namekian, then any Namekian can create these Dragon Balls, and therefore
heading to the Homeworld would be a wise idea.  Vegita, after being beaten on
Earth, headed for Namek as well, and the remaining Z-Senshi followed after. 
Upon reaching Namek, there were a series of events culminating in the
resurrection of Piccolo, the death of Vegita, and the defeat of Furiza by the
hands of Super Saiya-Jin Gokuu.  Furiza, however, was not dead.  His father,
King Cold, managed to save him and use the remaining parts of him to turn him
into a Cyborg.  These two extremely powerful monsters then travelled to Earth
to exact revenge upon Gokuu (and hopefully gain the Dragon Balls, probably for
the use of restoring Furiza to his original state).  However, the two and their
entire crew were destroyed by Mirai Trunks, the strange Super Saiya-Jin boy
from the future...

Furiza is the 3rd person you fight in the Story Mode, and never joins your
group.  Furiza is best described as a bulky all-white being with clawed hands
and feet and a tail.  He has purple stripes on his head, shoulders, and legs.

---Move List---

AWAY-DOWN, TOWARDS-UP + Y = Vertical Tail Corkscrew.  Furiza spins diagonally
upwards, using his tail as a weapon.  This attack is great for taking down a
jumping opponent.  However, don't think this move is religated solely to
anti-air functions.  Feel free to use it as, say, a quick escape (especially if
your opponent is using a move that takes long enough for you to remain safe
from retaliation).  7/10 (3/5, 4/5)

AWAY, DOWN, TOWARDS + B = Horizontal Tail Corkscrew.  Furiza spins
horizontally, using his tail as a weapon.  This attack is perfect for taking
control of a fight in a hurry, as the damage it does (as well as the priority
it has) are absolutely amazing.  Corner your opponent and go crazy!  8/10 (4/5
x 2)

DOWN, AWAY + Y = Backstep Elbow.  Furiza jumps backwards, then lunges forward
with his elbow extended.  This attack is just like Gokuu's Elbow and Vegita's
Headbutt - Knockback feature and Backstep invulnerability.  Gosh, aren't these
attacks nice?  Whenever you're being croweded and there's an opening, don't
hesitate to send your enemy sprawling!  8/10 (5/5, 3/5)

AWAY, TOWARDS + A = Finger Laser.  Furiza points his finger and shoots a quick
beam of energy from it.  This move is straight from the manga - it's the move
Furiza used to kill Dende.  However, in this game it has been significantly
toned down, to the extent where it is equal to Piccolo's Eyebeam attack. 
However, this doesn't mean the move is useless; it can be used in a variety of
situations.  Because of its speed, it can be used to quickly negate regular Ki
blasts or stop a merciless rushdown-player.  The only downside is the range of
the attack, which is - to put it bluntly - pathetic.  9/10 (4/5, 5/5)

DOWN, TOWARDS + A = Kinetic Slam.  Furiza shoots a blast of energy from his
palm, quickly travelling across the screen.  While this attack doesn't do that
much damage, the real purpose of the blast is simple - Just like the Backstep
series of attacks, this move features the Knockback style of hitting.  This
move has such a little start-up and travels so quickly that you could feasibly
use it in close-proximity and still connect.  Also, it covers a VERY large
range, so you can stop an attempt at launching a Super Ki Blast in no time. 
The only detriments I can think of about this attack are the fact that if you
miss with it Furiza will be open to attack until the projectile is gone, and
regular Ki blasts will take it out.  Abuse this move as much as you can; it
will save you from many a bad situation!  10/10 (5/5 x 2)

% AWAY, DOWN, TOWARDS + A = Chou KienZan.  Furiza charges up an Energy Attack
in the form of a large disk, which explodes on contact.  This move is Kuririn's
trademark attack, which was quickly picked up by Furiza.  This is Furiza's
Weaker Super Ki blast.  30%-50% of 1 bar, 25% Ki.  7/10 (4/5, 3/5)

%% TOWARDS, DOWN, AWAY + A = Black Hole Death Ball.  Furiza charges up a ball
of energy, then continues to force it into a denser ball until it collapses
upon itself, creating a Black Hole.  He then throws this ball at his opponent. 
This is as close to a trademark attack as Furiza ever got (aside from his
Finger Laser).  It is Furiza's Stronger Ki blast.  75% of 1 bar, 50% Ki.  8/10
(4/5 x 2)

---Special Note---
Furiza is a very special individual indeed.  He is the ONLY character in the
game to have a special ability with his dash - when you are dashing towards
your opponent, you'll notice that Furiza flies forward, but when you stop
Dashing (i.e., release the Dash Button), Furiza will pull a quick flip and land
gracefully.  While this is fun to look at, it serves a duel purpose - when
Furiza does this, he is impervious to attacks.  What does this mean?  Not only
does Furiza have ANOTHER attack that grants him a short spurt of Invincibility,
but this one is extremely quick and allows him to pass THROUGH attacks
(including all Ki blasts, excepting the Super Ki blasts) on the whim of your
character.  That's right - you have a 1-button attack that makes you invincible
and closes the gap between you and your opponent in an instant, allowing you to
destroy them!  Rating this as an attack, it gets a 6/5 for use (1 button
invulnerability + speed), and also gets a 6/5 for usage (c'mon, in THIS game
this is ALL you really need).  Just when you thought there couldn't be a more
perfect attack than the Renzoku Energy Dan, this comes along and makes it look
like a waste of time!  12/10 (6/5 x 2)

---Overall---
Furiza is a strange character.  He has some very nice close-range moves, but
they tend to be useless (and even downright dangerous) when avoided.  The main
focus of his attacks seem to be that of stopping whatever might be coming at
him - a quick Finger Laser to stop a Ki blast, a Backstep Elbow or Kinetic Slam
to send a pesky opponent away, etc.  Going off of his moves, Furiza's specialty
seems to be that of a keep-away artist.  Play defensive until your opponent is
beaten down, but don't ignore his offensive capabilities - those Tail Spins do
quite a nice amount of damage, provided the connect.  Above all, abuse Furiza's
Toward Dash to avoid attacks and set up for a counter-attack of your own.  It's
the absolute best ability Furiza has, and is probably the best overall ability
in the game.  That may be a gutsy thing to say this far into the FAQ, but I
doubt if I'll be proven wrong.


----------------------------------------
---V-F: Dr. Gero/Artificial Human #20---
----------------------------------------

Doctor Gero was a doctor working for the evil organization Red Ribbon, which
sought to take over the world.  In an effort to do so, they tried to gather the
Dragon Ball to wish for whatever they desired.  Gokuu, seeking the Dragon Balls
as well, confronted the entire army and destroyed their leaders (and most of
the fortress with it).  Gero, thus being put out of a job, began work to exact
his revenge upon the lad that ruined him.  His primary work for Red Ribbon was
making Artificial Humans, one of which betraying him to join Gokuu (#8).  Gero
continued his work with Artificial Humans until he grew too old to see his work
completed.

In an effort to continue on indefinitely, he had his brain transplanted into a
robotic body resembling his own.  This Gero had the brain of the previous, plus
immense strength and the ability to absorb pure energy and add it to his own. 
This is #20, aka the former Doctor Gero.  Dr. Gero is an old man (or, at least,
was designed to look like one) with a long shock of white hair showing from
underneath his black cap.  This cap has the Red Ribbon symbol on it - 2 red
R's.  Dr. Gero is the 4th person you fight in the Story Mode, and doesn't join
your group afterwards (since, according to the anime/manga, Dr. Gero was
destroyed shortly after this fight).

Special Note - Dr. Gero had a small bug tracking Gokuu, monitoring his fights
and training, so Gero would know exactly how Gokuu (and others) would fight. 
Therefore, it's perfectly understandable for him and his creations to directly
copy certain attacks from other characters.  Therefore, one could say that the
programmers weren't being lazy, they were actually following the show and knew
exactly what they were doing!

---Move List---

DOWN-AWAY, UP-TOWARDS + Y = Modified Gokuu Jumping "Headbutt".  Gero jumps
diagonally upwards with his metallic cranium, hoping to score a hit.  Boy, a
lot of characters have this style of attack, don't they?  This attack is
(apparently) the standard anti-air move.  Use it to stop opponents jumping in,
or use it to escape an attack of two.  7/10 (3/5, 4/5)

DOWN, AWAY + Y = Modified Vegita "Surprise" Headbutt.  Gero appears to fall
down on the ground, then suddenly springs up and dashes forward with his
forehead, hoping to strike a hit.  This move is a modification of Vegita's
Backstep Headbutt; however, Gero is actually invulnerable while he's on the
ground.  Attacks pass right through him, so this attack makes a VERY nice
counter-attack.  However, he can be hit during the actual Headbutt, so don't
think it's the end-all attack.  9/10 (5/5, 4/5)

DOWN, TOWARDS + Y = Artificial Human Uppercut Combo.  Gero slides forward with
an uppercut, then spins around and delivers and elbow attack.  Gero's uppercut
combo can be linked right into off of a jump in or a quick Punch/Kick attack,
while barely knocking his opponent very far away.  If you want to, you can
follow this move up with a Surprise Headbutt, thus adding to the damage nicely
(or, if you so chose, dash in and pull and Absorb Attack).    The only true
problem with this move is that in between the uppercut and the elbow, there is
a lull long enough for your opponent to block the final hit, or even counter. 
While it is a good move for chipping, I don't think it's that great a move to
use, especially against your more advanced opponents.  8/10 (5/5, 3/5)

TOWARDS, AWAY, TOWARDS + Y = Backstab Punch.  Gero quickly dashes forward (past
his opponent, if they are in range), turns, and jabs directly behind him (in
his opponents' back).  This attack is good and effective as long as you are
close enough for Gero to travel to the other side of his opponent.  If not,
he'll simply move forward, then turn around and attack air - leaving himself
VERY wide open for an attack.  6/10 (3/5 x 2)

AWAY, TOWARDS + A = Piccolo's Eyebeam.  Gero fires a quick beam out of his
eyes.  This move is directly copied from Piccolo.  Sadly, that means that any
bad traits the attack had came along with the good.  The attack has the same
pitiful range as Piccolo's, and does just as much damage.  However, the fact
that it can quickly be fired off to destroy an incoming Ki blast (or opponent)
makes it worthwhile to have.  9/10 (4/5, 5/5)

TOWARDS, DOWN, AWAY + A = Absorbing Attack.  Gero, using the small pads on his
hands, can suck the energy out of someone simply by grabbing them.  That is
exactly what this attack does - Gero grabs ahold of his opponent and draws
energy out of them, reducing their life while increasing his own.  This attack
ALONE makes Gero a formidable opponent - at any moment he can turn the tide of
the fight in his favor.  However, it requires a close-proximity in order to use
it, so a good keepaway artist (Furiza) can prevent him from utilizing this
attack.  7/10 (4/5, 3/5)

% AWAY, DOWN, TOWARDS + A = Energy Discharge Blast.  Gero can shoot blasts of
energy out of the small pads on his hands just as well as he can absorb energy
through them.  Long story short - Gero fires a blast out of his hands.  Sadly,
Gero only has 1 Super Ki blast, and this is it.  Also, this is the equivalent
of a Weaker Ki blast, so don't expect too much from it.  7/10 (4/5, 3/5)

NOTE - Dr. Gero's Special Ki Defense (Ki Absorb) is located in section IV.

---Overall---
Dr. Gero is a close-range fighter through and through.  He has combo attacks,
defensive-attacks, a draining attack, and a quick Ki attack used for stopping
onslaughts.  His Ki Absorb defense makes the use of Super Ki blasts a waste of
time, so opponents will be forced to use regular attacks to combat him.  If
they get in too close, Gero will absorb life from them.  His only weakness is
his inability to keep up with a good keepaway player (Vegita, Furiza, etc). 
Try to keep Gero within 2 screens of the person he's fighting, or else you'll
start to have problems.  However, if they're naive enough to throw a Ki blast
at you, make sure they realize how futile it is!


-------------------------------
---V-G: Artificial Human #18---
-------------------------------

Dr. Gero, seeking to exact revenge on Gokuu, had been programming robots to do
his dirty work.  Gero found that strictly machine-based robots were too
powerful to handle, so he decided to go back to Organic-Machine hybrids
(Cyborgs for short).  In order to have more test subjects, he kidnapped the
twins that would become #17 and #18 (and, eventually, made himself into one). 
These two, even after Gero's programming, were too difficult to control, so he
was forced to shut them down.  After finding that the Earthlings were more
powerful than he had expected, Gero was forced to retreat to his lab to
reactivate #17 and #18.  They immediately rebelled against him, killing him and
going off on their own.

#18 is the Blond-haired female twin.  While programmed by Gero, she still has
her own free will (not to mention incredible strength).  Her stamina is derived
from a power source Gero created, somehow linked to the infinite gravity pull
of an energy well.  This gives her an unlimited supply of energy.  #18
eventually married Kuririn, and years later had a child with him named Marron
(see, she's not ALL robot).  As I previously stated, she is a blond, and is
dressed in a jean jacket and skirt over a black shirt and black pants, with
brown boots and white striped sleeves.  She is the 5th person you fight in the
Story Mode, but does not join your group.

---Move List---

AWAY-DOWN, TOWARDS-UP + B = Gokuu's Jumping Knee.  #18 jumps diagonally upward
with her knee extended.  As with everyone else, this move is a great anti-air,
as well as a convenient escape from danger.  7/10 (3/5, 4/5)

AWAY-DOWN, UP + B = Modified Jumping Knee - Jumping Drop.  While not very
lady-like, #18 can change her Jumping Knee attack.  How does she do it? 
Instead of hitting on the upward movement, she flies up and drops down,
attacking with her behind as a weapon.  When she does this, she strikes enemies
as she descends.  Mixing this attack up with her regular Jumping Knee is
effective, as is using it to avoid an attack, then dropping down on your
unsuspecting opponent.  6/10 (2/5, 4/5)

DOWN, TOWARDS + B = Vegita's Sliding Kick.  #18, just like Vegita, slides
forward with her foot extended, tripping her opponent upon connecting.  This
attack is great for avoiding projectiles and attacking all at once.  You're not
forced to take the hit, and you can easily counter the attack if you're in
close when performing.  This is one of those attacks that you just HAVE to
abuse!  10/10 (5/5 x 2)

DOWN, AWAY + Y = Gokuu's Backstep Elbow.  Mimicking Gokuu, #18 slides
backwards, the rushes forward with her elbow extended.  This move acts the same
and has the same effects as Gokuu and Furiza's elbow attacks.  Therefore, it
should be used in the same way - a quick counter for a rushdown opponent, etc. 
8/10 (5/5, 3/5)

DOWN, TOWARDS + Y = Artificial Human Uppercut Combo.  As programmed into her by
Gero, #18 can slide perform his uppercut combo.  She slides forward with an
uppercut, then turns and hits with her elbow.  This attack is quick to connect
upon using, so you can chain it off of a jumping attack or use it to punish a
missed attempt by your opponent.  The only true problem with this move is that
in between the uppercut and the elbow, there is a lull long enough for your
opponent to block the final hit, or even counter.  While it is a good move for
chipping, I don't think it's that great a move to use, especially against your
more advanced opponents.  7/10 (5/5, 2/5)

DOWN, TOWARDS + A = Piccolo's Seeking Ki Blast.  Using a technique learned from
watching Piccolo (and programmed into her by Gero), #18 can release a small orb
of energy that tracks its target.  Also like Piccolo, #18 has no start-up when
using this move, so you can abuse it all you want.  It takes little Ki to use
and is very effective for hitting your opponent, so make sure this is a very
important part of your arsenal.  10/10 (5/5 x 2)

AWAY, DOWN + A = Ground Shave Energy Blade.  #18 throws her arm up, releasing
an energy blast that quickly shoots across the ground.  This move is very
effective when it comes to irritating keepaway players.  It travels quickly,
takes little Ki to use, and takes off a VERY respectable amount of life
(slightly less than the standard Weaker Super Ki blast).  Unfortunately, this
can be negated by a regular Ki blast, so it can easily be dispersed.  However,
for the taller characters (Cell, #16, Perfect Cell) this attack passes right
under their regular Ki blasts.  9/10 (5/5, 4/5)

% DOWN, AWAY, TOWARDS + A = One-Handed Blast.  #18 holds up a single hand and
lets loose with a powerful blast of energy from her palm.  This is #18's only
Super Ki blast, and (sadly) it is the equivalent of a Weaker Super Ki blast
(30%-50% life, 25% Ki).  6/10 (3/5 x 2)

NOTE - #18's special Super Ki Defense (Impenetrable Shield) is listed in
section IV.

---Overall---
In general, #18 is about as much of a counter-agent as you can get.  I mean
this because she has a counter for just about anything your opponent can throw
at you!  Her lack of any truly damaging attacks brings her down a little, but
don't ignore how much damage can be done when you relentlessly persue your
opponent with the weaker stuff!


-------------------------
---V-H: Imperfect Cell---
-------------------------

Dr. Gero, after years of working with robots and artificial humans, finally
found the perfect biological weapon - since he knew he couldn't defeat Gokuu
and the others presently, he made a new fighter from their very DNA.  This
fighter combined the best aspects from every person - Piccolo's healing, the
Saiya-Jin's ability to gain great strength from fights, Furiza's ability to
survive in any climate and setting, not to mention the attacks from each
fighter.  However, this creature, named Cell, would take too long to come to
fruition, and in order for it to reach its perfect state it required the energy
sources linked to #17 and #18.  Since Gero had already used those energy
sources for #17 and #18, he improvised - he gave Cell a tail with a Suction on
the end, giving Cell the ability to drain people of their very energy and
absorb people (specifically, #17 and #18).

Cell was finally born in the future, years after Gokuu had died from his heart
disease.  This Cell watched as Trunks battled the evil twins, and soon realized
that he was far too weak to absorb them.  Cell knew that he could raise his
power significantly by absorbing power from the locals, but soon found that #17
and #18 had disposed of most of the population.  Cell was at a stalemate, until
he discovered that Trunks had a time machine.  Cell plotted to kill Trunks and
take his time machine into the past, where there were more people for him to
absorb.  Thus, Cell could become strong enough to take the Artificial Humans
and transform into his Perfect Form.  Cell, being too large to fit into the
Time Machine, was forced to shrink himself down to a much smaller form, costing
him a great deal of strength.  Upon traveling back in time, Cell put himself
into a form of stasis, allowing himself to regrow some of his lost strength
until he was strong enough to start absorbing people again.  A few years later,
Cell had finished, and was ready to begin anew - until the Z-Senshi discovered
him.  For Cell, it is now a race against time, against a new set of foes - not
only are the Androids avoiding him, but the Z-Senshi are looking to destroy
him!

This Cell is the 6th person you fight in the Story Mode.  He has the appearance
of an overgrown bug, green with black flecks all over.  He has clawed hands and
feet, as well as a long tail with a metallic-looking stinger on the end. 
Cell's head consists of a large greenish crest that resembled a strange hat,
directly situated above 2 large eyes and a pale ridge that served as a mouth.

---Move List---

TOWARDS, DOWN, AWAY + B = Telekinetic Vaccuum Slam.  Imperfect Cell suddenly
draws in his opponent, then smashes them away with a swipe from his clawed
hand.  This attack, while not overly powerful, is great for stopping enemies
getting ready to attack you with a normal physical attack.  Provided they're in
range (about a 1/2 screen distance), you can nab them out of anything as long
as they're not blocking.  This attack works like the Backstep attacks, sending
your opponent a VERY long distance.  8/10 (4/5 x 2)

AWAY-DOWN, TOWARDS-UP + B = Tail Swipe.  Cell swings his tail up in front of
him, arcing upwards to deter any jumping opponents.  Because Cell isn't the
most agile of aggressors, he lacks the ability to hop upwards at a moments'
notice.  However, his extra appendage can be used in leu of this ability,
allowing Cell to stop any airborne attackers without having to move an inch. 
8/10 (3/5, 5/5)

AWAY, DOWN + B = Surprise Tail Slide.  Cell quickly slides forward with his
tail slightly in front of him, striking his opponent in the knees and knocking
them down.  This attack is useful in the fact that Cell doesn't make any extra
movement to show that he's moving - he just suddenly slides forward, knocking
down his opponent and dealing a decent amount of damage.  However, this attack
leaves Cell VERY vulnerable should it miss, and he can be knocked out of it
with any attack hitting him.  Still, if you have the need to stop an irritating
enemy so you can get away from them or simply stop them from attacking, knock
'em down!  7/10 (4/5, 3/5)

AWAY, DOWN + A = Ground Shave Energy Blade.  Cell, using the same programming
that #18 received, throws a blade of energy that travels across the ground. 
This attack is great, considering how easy it is and how much damage it does. 
It travels quickly and does a very respectable amount of damage.  However, it
is negated by regular Ki blasts, so don't go wild with it - you could end up
leaving yourself wide open.  9/10 (5/5, 4/5)

TOWARDS, DOWN, AWAY + A = Tail Energy Absorb.  Cell picks up his opponent with
his tail and drains a small portion of their life, adding it to his own.  Just
like Dr. Gero, if Cell is close enough he can pick up his opponent and restore
lost health by adding it to his own.  The only difference in the attacks is
that Cell uses his tail instead of his hands.  7/10 (4/5, 3/5)

% DOWN, AWAY, TOWARDS + A = Kamehame-Ha.  Cell charges up a blast between his
clawed hands, then releases it in a beam of energy towards his opponent. 
That's right, it's Cell using Kamesennin's trademark attack!  Having this
attack programmed into him by Gero, Cell is capable of launching Gokuu's
favorite attack as his weaker Super Ki Blast (30-50% HP, 25% Ki.)  6/10 (3/5 x
2)

%% AWAY, DOWN, DOWN-TOWARDS + A = Mankaksopoppo.  Cell points his fingers
towards his head, charging up energy, then releases the attack in a powerful
screw-beam of energy.  Cell, using Piccolo's trademark attack, can be quite
devastating at a distance, as this is his stronger Super Ki Blast (75% HP, 50%
Ki).  8/10 (4/5 x 2)

---Overall---
Overall, Cell is a tank.  He's a big, lumbering guy who can jump high and dole
out a lot of damage.  The problem with him is he is unequipped to handle the
faster, more maneuverable characters.  With Cell, your best bet is to stick
close to your opponent and hope to wear them down with swipes and slides, and
whenever you can try to absorb energy from your opponent - this can very
quickly turn the tide of a fight.  However, if your opponent is playing a very
good keep-away game, use a Telekinetic Slam to send them away, then launch a Ki
blast at 'em.

---V-I: Artificial Human #16---
-------------------------------

Dr. Gero, prior to creating the infamous Artificial Humans #17 and #18, toyed
with machine-based fighters quite a bit.  He found that their strength was only
limited to how strong he made them, and since he could program them to do
whatever he wanted they would be the ideal fighters/servants.  Upon creating
#16, he made a fighter with a strength unheard of before.  Gero immediately
programmed it with a single prime directive - destroy Gokuu.  However, this
programming interferred with anything else Gero wanted #16 to do - all it would
say is that it could not, for it was supposed to destroy Gokuu.  #16 was far
too powerful to control, and he wouldn't listen to anything Gero told him to
do.  Dejected, Gero shut down #16 and put him in stasis.  The Doctor then went
back to Cybernetic/Human creations, hoping to have more control over his
creations.  Unfortunately, #17 and #18 were too stubborn to listen to him
either.  Because of this, he shut them down as well.  After creating one final
robotic counterpart and transferring his mind into that of a lookalike robot,
Gero set out to destroy Gokuu himself.

Upon being beaten by the Z-Senshi, Gero retreated to his lab where he was
forced to unleash #17 and #18.  He threatened them to aid him or he would
detonate the bombs located inside of them.  Instead of obeying, they killed him
and released #16.  The 3 Artificial Humans then trekked across the countryside,
looking for Gokuu and causing mayhem all the while.  Unfortunately, Cell soon
became the major threat when he arose to absorb #17 and #18.  #16, seeking to
not let that happen, went up against him, only to lose badly.  Bulma
reprogrammed the giant robot to aid them, and showed up at the Cell games for
support.  However, he was destroyed before Gohan's very eyes, triggering
Gohan's transformation into SSj 2.  Thus was the end of #16...

#16 is the incredibly powerful Android that you must face off against after
defeating Imperfect Cell.  He is the 7th Contender in Story Mode.  He is
wearing a green and black outfit, and has bright red hair.  When all else
fails, you can tell which person this is by the fact that he detaches his hands
throughout the fight to use them as weapons or shoot projectiles from them!

---Move List---

TOWARDS, AWAY, TOWARDS + B = Machine Gun Kicks.  #16 flies forward, kicking
rapidly with his foreleg.  Want to talk about an attack that does great damage
hit AND blocked?  This is it; #16's legwork is fantastic, allowing him to
strike multiple times.  Unlike other repeated-strike attacks, once this one
connects the rest of the hits are guaranteed.  Yes, you can be hit out of it,
but I wouldn't want to get close enough for him to hit me!  8/10 (3/5, 5/5)

AWAY-DOWN, TOWARDS-UP + B = Gokuu's Arrow Knee.  Just like Gokuu (since it was
programmed into him), #16 can jump upward with his knee extended and strike
opponents as they're in the air.  This attack is good for stopping incoming
opponents, as well as its use as a quick escape from an attack.  7/10 (3/5,
4/5)

DOWN, TOWARDS + B =  Corkscrew Kick.  #16 spins around and delivers a powerful
kick.  This attack serves as #16's Backstep attack; when it connects it sends
his opponent flying very far.  It's fairly quick and powerful, so it can be
used as a counter-attack.  However, if you miss then you're going to be left
open, so be careful when using this attack.  7/10 (4/5, 3/5)

TOWARDS, AWAY, TOWARDS + Y = Double Arm Slam.    #16 throws his arms out in
both directions, causing anything he hits to fly a great distance.  This attack
is THE end-all attack for #16 - it's powerful, it's fast, it's fairly easy to
do, it gets rid of pesky enemies in a heartbeat, and (most of all) it gives #16
a brief moment of invulnerability.  If you can time it right, you can have
attacks simply pass through you, including Projectiles.  This is an incredibly
nice attack, since at any moment you can flat-out halt your opponent.  9/10
(3/5, 6/5)  (That's right, I put 6/5 - it's off the scale in terms of
usefulness).

TOWARDS, AWAY, TOWARDS + A = Piccolo's Eyebeams.  #16, using the programming
put into him by Dr. Gero, can mimic Piccolo's ability to shoot beams of energy
from his eyes.  This attack, while not very powerful, makes up its usefulness
in the fact that it can be used to halt an enemy OR stop a regular projectile
from hitting.  How nice is that - someone throws out a Seeking Ki blast, only
to have it stopped mere feet from #16!  8/10 (3/5, 5/5)

DOWN, TOWARDS + A = Long Distance Jab.  #16, since he IS a machine, is capable
of detaching his arms and using them as projectiles.  That is the basis of this
attack - #16 holds his arm out and shoots his arm off, striking up to a certain
distance then drawing it back in.  This attack is not only easy to use, but is
extremely useful since it can negate Ki blasts AND continue on to strike his
opponent.  The only downside to this attack is that if it misses, #16 has to
wait for his arm to retract and reattach before he can continue on fighting -
which means if your opponent somehow dodged the attack, they're free to wail on
you.  However, given how fast and far this attack moves, the odds of your
opponent being missed are slim.  10/10 (5/5 x 2)

%% AWAY, D0WN, D0WN-T0WARDS + A = Hell Crusher.  #16 removes his hands and
launches a powerful energy blast from his arm sockets.  As with #20 and #18,
#16 only has 1 Super Ki Blast.  The funny thing is, unlike theirs #16's is the
equivalent of a Strong Super Ki blast, meaning it takes off abot 75% of
someone's life and takes 50% of your Ki bar.  Go for it, oversized Redhead
Robot-Man!  8/10 (4/5 x 2)

---Overall---
Overall, #16 is a powerhouse to contend with.  He's got attacks that are good
for chipping away at your life, attacks that are great for defending against Ki
blasts, an attack that can rip through Ki blasts and hit you at the same time,
and an attack that pretty much makes him impervious to all damage.  The guy is
a menace at a distance, since his only Super Ki Blast is a strong one (and his
long-distance Jab will stop any Ki blasts from getting to him), and he's even
worse at close.  Playing as him means pressuring your opponent no matter what
distance you're at, while playing against him means hoping he'll make a mistake
and open himself up for a combo or quick special move.

* ---V-J: Mirai Trunks---
-------------------------

Mirai Trunks (Future Trunks) is the son of Vegita and Bulma.  His first
appearance from the future was to deliver a special medicine that would prevent
Gokuu from dying.  In his timeline, Gokuu died from the a heart disease, and
because he hadn't been there the Artificial Humans #17 and #18 destroyed most
of the population of the Earth, including the Z-Senshi.  By saving Gokuu's
life, Trunks created a seperate timeline than the one he came from - one that
dealt with 3 different Artificial Humans, plus a more powerful set of the 2 he
was familiar with.  Trunks stayed with the Z-Senshi of the past, training and
fighting the Artificial Humans and (eventually) Cell.  Trunks finally got to
meet his father, Vegita, but was bothered by the arrogant, uncaring person he
saw.  He eventually came to realize how his father was, and respected the man -
but that doesn't mean he necessarily LIKED him.  Trunks showed his support by
showing up at the Cell games, ready to participate.  Unfortunately, his
appearance was more bad than good, as he was killed by Perfect Cell.  This
enraged Vegita enough to cause him to blast Cell, distracting him enough for
Gohan to overpower him and kill him.  Trunks was wished back to life with the
Dragon Balls, and then returned to his own timeline.  Because of his incredible
growth in strength, Trunks was able to defeat the Artificial Humans and Cell in
his own timeline, thus stopping the cycle from continueing.

This Trunks is the Trunks from the future, not the lazy Trunks that fought
during the Buu saga.  He is the 8th Contender in the Story Mode.  Trunks sports
the same armor styling that Vegita wears, and has long Purple hair (which came
from his mother, obviously).  When Trunks enters battle, he automatically
powers up to SSj, making his purple hair fray out in every direction and turn
blond.

---Move List---

DOWN, TOWARDS + B (while in air) = Dive Kick.  Trunks, just like the majority
of the characters in this game, can jump in the air and dive downwards with a
kick, ki eminating from his foot.  Yippy skippy!  8/10 (4/5 x 2)

DOWN-AWAY, UP-TOWARDS + B = Flip & Knee.  Trunks flips diagonally upwards,
kicking, then lands and slides foward with his knee extended.  This attack
seems to be an attempt at both an anti-air as well as a ground-based attack.  
The problem, however, is that it really isn't either - it lacks a good vertical
reach, and it doesn't travel very far horizontally.  However, the attack does
good damage and has the Knockback feature, and Trunks is invincible the entire
time he's performing the flip, so it's not entirely bad...  7/10 (3/5, 4/5)

AWAY, DOWN, TOWARDS + B = Triple Flip Kick.  Trunks flips foward 3 times,
hitting the entire time.  Now THIS is an attack - it covers good ground, comes
out quickly and doesn't leave you very open, and does really good damage. 
Trunks' triple flip can chip away a good portion of life, not to mention the
damage it does when ALL of the hits connect.  Needless to say, this is a corner
attack through and through - chip, chip, chip, and they've got a problem!  The
only setback with this attack is that you CAN retaliate in between kicks.  8/10
(4/5 x 2)

DOWN, AWAY + Y = Backstep Elbow and Knee.  Trunks hops back, then lunges
forward with his Elbow.  He then continues forward, striking with his knee as
well.  This attack is your standard backstep attack - frames of invincibility
and knockback - but this attack also has an extra hit, so at least you'll chip
that much more!  9/10 (5/5, 4/5)

DOWN, AWAY + A = Renzoku Energy Dan.  Trunks, just like everyone else who has
this attack, can launch 3 bolts of Ki at his opponent in a rapid fashion.  It's
quick, it's effective, it's great for stopping incoming projectiles or rushing
enemies, and it does good damage.  Use it today!  10/10 (5/5 x 2)

% DOWN, AWAY, TOWARDS + A = Finishing Buster.  One of Trunks' trademark
attacks, this attack is shown by Trunks performing a myriad of arm movements,
then holding his arms out.  His hands are together horizontally, with the palms
facing his opponent.  His forefingers and thumbs are pressed together, as if
making an OK sign.  He then lets loose with a blast, headed towards his
opponent.  Ok, descriptions aside, this attack really isn't much to write home
about.  It's Trunks' weaker Super Ki blast.  6/10 (3/5 x 2)

%% AWAY, DOWN, TOWARDS + A = Burning Attack.  The "other" trademark attack of
Trunks', this one depicts him charging up a massive ball of energy behind his
head, then hurling it at his opponent.  As with the Finishing Buster, this
attack didn't actually have a name until it was given one in the video games (I
believe the first one these attacks were named in was "Hot Battle! the
Androids!" for the NES/Famicom). This is Trunks' stronger Super Ki blast,
meaning it takes off 75% of his opponent's life, while costing 50% of the Ki
bar.  8/10 (4/5 x 2)

---Overall---
Overall, Trunks is a great in-fighting character.  His triple-flip attack is
great for chipping or simply dealing out damage, and his Flip & Dash and
Backstep attacks warrant him some frames of invincibility should the going get
rough.  The only ranged attack he truly has is his Renzoku Energy Dan (and his
2 Super Ki blasts, of course), so make sure you can keep close to your opponent
if you want to win.  Don't think of him as the end-all close range fighter,
though - think of him more as an evasive fighter; he may not be the best at it,
but he can usually avoid hits just as well as taking them.  He has
invulnerability, Knockback, a Dive Kick, and projectiles to keep him safe.  Do
make sure you keep him safe, won't you?  It's awfully hard to win if you're
dead...


------------------------
* ---V-J: Chibi Gohan---
------------------------

Shortly after the defeat of Piccolo Jr. at the finals of the 23rd Tenkai-Ichi
Boudokai, Gokuu and Chi-Chi were married.  About 1 year later, their son Gohan
was born.  Gohan, because of his half-Saiya-Jin and half-Human blood, had
enormous potential as a fighter.  He first showed this potential when he was
kidnapped by Garlic Jr. and his minions, and later demonstrated it again when
Raditz, Gokuu's evil brother, kidnapped him.  Gohan was trained by Piccolo, and
showed very strong signs of respect towards him afterward - he had a suit made
that resembled Piccolo's, and stayed good friends with his former teacher. 
Gohan participated in every major battle he was exposed to after his
introduction, from Raditz to Vegita to Furiza to the Artificial Humans.

In this game, Gohan's first appearance is inside the Room of Space and Time,
training with Gokuu (or whoever you choose to fight him with).  This was
shortly after Gohan learned to go SSj, thanks to his father's training.  Gohan
would eventually go on to defeat Cell twice and save the planet.  Gohan is the
9th person you square off against in the Story Mode.  He normally has black
hair (in whatever hair style his mother has cooked up for him), but in battle
he sports the blond SSj style.  He also wears a purple uniform that matches
Piccolo's.

---Move List---

TOWARDS, DOWN + B (while in Air) = Dive Kick.  Just like everyone else with
this move, Gohan can jump in the air and dive towards his enemy with a small
cone of energy around his foot.  Standard uses - avoidance, counter-attack, and
anything else you can think of.  8/10 (4/5 x 2)

AWAY-DOWN, TOWARDS-UP + B = Flip & Kick.  Almost like Mirai Trunks (which is
weird, since Mirai Trunks trained with a different Gohan), Chibi Gohan can flip
upwards (flipping AND turning around in air, I might add), then land, spin, and
kick his opponent.  This attack appears to cover more room Vertically and
Horizontally than Trunks' version; however, you'll note that it IS the same
distance (Gohan is shorter, and thus DOES move further - however, it's the same
distance altogether).  Appearances aside, this attack acts the same as Trunks'
- frames of invincibility and Knockback included.  And don't forget that extra
kick!  7/10 (3/5, 4/5)

DOWN, TOWARDS + B = Sliding Kick.  Just like Vegita and #18 (whom probably
learned it when Dr. Gero studied them both and programmed her accordingly),
Gohan can slide forward with his foot extended.  This attack features the
Knockdown style of hitting, not to mention the zero startup and zero lag.  All
these, combined with Gohan's short stature, make this an attack EXTREMELY
useful against the larger characters (Hey Perfect Cell, you just hit the
pavement!  Next time don't try a regular Ki blast on me, you friggin' idiot!). 
10/10 (5/5 x 2)

TOWARDS, AWAY, TOWARDS + Y = Renzoku Naguru-Ken (I forgot the real name, so I
made one up).  This attack is simple - Gohan goes ballistic, moving forward
while punching repeatedly.  After all the punching, he hops backward a short
distance.  This attack is much like #16's Machine Gun Kicks - repeated attacks
that do a lot of damage, chipped or not.  The only difference (aside from one
being punches and the other being kicks) is that Gohan's will hit more, but can
be avoided/blocked/countered after every punch.  Abuse this attack for all its
work, folks - if you connect, your opponent's going to be whining for a
while...  8/10 (3/5, 5/5)

DOWN, AWAY + A = Renzoku Energy Dan.  Gohan tosses out 3 blasts of Ki from
alternating hands.  Just like all others that have this move, Gohan can let
loose with the "Triple Threat" as my friends have dubbed it.  Practically no
start-up, little Ki required, and it does a nice chunk of damage when it all
connects.  Ain't life grand?  10/10 (5/5 x 2)

% AWAY, DOWN, DOWN-TOWARDS + A = Masenkou. Gohan holds his hands above his
forehead, charging up energy.  He then points his arms towards his opponent,
one hand behind each other with the palms facing out, and lets loose with a
beam of energy.  This is Gohan's Trademark attack, which was taught to him by
Piccolo during their training before the arrival of the Saiya-Jins.  However,
this attack was soon abandoned in favor of the most commonly-used "special"
attack of the series - the Kamehame-Ha.  I don't know what the programmer(s)
was/were thinking when he/they decided to make the movement for this attack
almost exactly the same as the Kamehame-ha, but it's frustrating nonetheless. 
5/10 (2/5, 3/5)

%% AWAY, DOWN, TOWARDS + A = Kamehame-Ha.  Gohan charges up energy between his
hands, then releases it in a blast of energy towards his opponent.  As denoted
by the dual percentage marks, this is Gohan's more powerful Super Ki blast. 
It's a good attack; however, the fact that it's almost exactly the same
movement as the Masenkou is REALLY frustrating.  Someone needs a good thrashing
for THAT mistake...  7/10 (3/5, 4/5)

---Overall---
Overall, Gohan is a short fighter with a LOT of strength in his attacks.  His
repeated punch combo is good for chipping or flat-out damage, although it can
leave him a little open; however, creative use of his Flip Kick and Renzoku
Energy Dan can easily correct this.  Overall, though, you should play Gohan as
he is - a short player who can avoid attacks and return fire extremely well. 
Don't underestimate his strength - he might not have the raw power of some
others, but he can easily make it up in a few blows more (which, of course, he
could avoid but you can't).

----------------------------------
* ---V-K: Super Saiya-Jin Gokuu---
----------------------------------

The Z-Senshi had many challenges to face when they went up against Furiza. 
Ultimately, though, the only person left alive for them to deal with was Furiza
himself.  The only person strong enough to take Furiza in his final form was
Gokuu.  Even at his max, Gokuu couldn't defeat Furiza, so he was forced to have
Piccolo distract him long enough to create a massive Genki Tama.  This attack
somehow failed in killing Furiza, and left Gokuu and Piccolo too drained to do
anything when Furiza resurfaced.  Furiza then shot Piccolo with a near-fatal
blow, infuriating Gokuu.  Then he telekinetically picked up Kuririn, Gokuu's
best friend, and made him explode before Gokuu's very eyes.  This drove Gokuu
over the edge, causing his rage to trigger a genetic "power-up" in a Saiya-Jin,
causing them to gain awesome amounts of strength and change their hair color to
Blonde.  This is Super Saiya-Jin Gokuu, who looks just like regular ol' Gokuu
(but has blond hair now).  You never actually fight SSj Gokuu in the Story
Mode; instead, Gokuu automatically becomes SSj Gokuu when you reach Furiza.

Note:  Once in the SSj state, a Saiya-Jin can no longer use Kai-oh Sama's
techniques (Kai-oh Ken or the Genki Tama).  This was found out when Gokuu
attempted to power up a Genki Tama in SSj form while fighting Buu, only to
completely lose the energy he was drawing in!  Therefore, Gokuu can no longer
use Kai-oh Ken or the Genki Tama attacks.  However, the mini Genki Tama has
been replaced by a similar seeking blast, so you shouldn't worry 'bout that -
it does the same damage, and comes out instantly, so you can consider it an
upgrade!

---Move List---

DOWN, TOWARDS + B (while in air)  = Dive Kick.  By performing this motion while
in air, Gokuu will dive downwards diagonally, with his foot extended.  If you
need anything further, check out Regular Gokuu's movelist.  8/10 (4/5 x 2)

AWAY-DOWN, UP-TOWARDS + B = Arrow Knee.  Gokuu flies diagonally upwards with
his knee extended.  Yup, the same once again.  7/10 (3/5, 4/5)

AWAY, DOWN, TOWARDS + B = Quadruple Kick Combo.  Yay, something NEW for Gokuu! 
Upon going SSj, Gokuu loses the ability to use Kai-oh Ken (party because SSj
and Kai-oh Ken aren't compatible, and partly because the highest level of
Kai-oh Ken was far weaker than Gokuu when he initially went Super Saiya-Jin). 
However, in its stead he gains this potent kicking combination.  When executed,
Gokuu will kick 4 times with alternating legs.  While this attack is extremely
powerful (if all of the hits connect), the problem with it is that there is
incredible lag after every hit.  You don't have to have that good reflexes to
be able to counter after one or two hits.  Therefore, the effectiveness of this
attack drops a lot...however, for your run-of-the-mill player, it can still be
an effective weapon.  7/10 (4/5, 3/5)

DOWN, AWAY + Y = Backstep Elbow.  Gokuu slides backwards on the ground, then
rushes forward with his elbow extended.  Yeah...regular Gokuu again.  8/10
(5/5, 3/5)

DOWN, TOWARDS + A = Seeking Ki Blast.  Gokuu quickly throws out a small ball of
energy that will seek out its target.  This attack looks and acts like
Piccolo's Seeking Ki blast; in fact, you could pretty much say they're the same
thing.  Gone is Gokuu's Seeking mini-Genki Tama, which took forever to throw. 
This one is instanteous and just as painful.  10/10 (5/5 x 2)

AWAY, DOWN, TOWARDS, UP + B = Super Meteo Bashing.  Gokuu kicks his enemy up
into the air, hammers them back to the ground, then elbows them off to the
side.  As if SSj Gokuu wasn't overpowered enough, he still retains his Meteo! 
How do you like THEM apples?  6/10 (2/5, 4/5)

% DOWN, AWAY, TOWARDS + A = Kamehame-ha.  Gokuu charges up Kamesennin's
trademark attack, the Kamehame-ha, then launches it at his opponent.  This is
Gokuu's weaker Super Ki Blast.  Need to know more?  You know where to look. 
6/10 (3/5 x 2)

%% TOWARDS, DOWN, AWAY + A = Chou Kamehame-Ha.  Gokuu charges up an even MORE
powerful Kamehame-Ha, then unleashes it at his enemy.  Gokuu first used this
attack against Ma Junior (Piccolo) during the final rounds of the 23rd
Tenkai-Ichi Boudokai, which is (coincedently) where this game starts. 
Essentially, all it is is a Kamehame-Ha with even more energy pumped into it. 
I believe the mechanics of the original Kamehame-Ha is that the user draws in
as much energy as they can, then releases it in a little ball from their hands.
 The way this version works is that the user draws in an incredible amount of
energy, so much so that it gathers AROUND the user and is funnelled into the
blast.  But I digress...  8/10 (4/5 x 2)

---Overall---
SSj Gokuu, in transforming, loses one of the best abilities in the game (Kai-oh
Ken) in favor of a quicker seeking Ki blast and a kicking combo.  While the
Kicking Combo is pretty much useless against more advanced enemies, the Ki
blast is very effective nonetheless.  Your playing style with this Gokuu should
be geared more towards trapping than the all-out offensive you might have used
with Non-SSj Gokuu.  Since Gokuu lacks the ability to power up drastically, you
should spend your time making sure that all of the hits you're making count. 
Heh...does anyone else find it funny how Non-SSj Gokuu has the potential to, in
a round, do more damage than SSj Gokuu?  I do...

-----------------------------------
* ---V-L: Super Saiya-Jin Vegita---
-----------------------------------

Vegita, after 3 years of intensive training in a 300 Gs training room, had
still never accomplished that which Gokuu had - turning Super Saiya-Jin.  This
only enfuriated the Saiya-Jin prince even further; how is it that this
lower-class fighter could accomplish something the Price of all Saiya-Jins
could not?  This burned inside of Vegita, until his frustration at himself and
his anger towards his hated rival caused him to reach new levels of anger. 
This extreme anger triggered the transformation, and Vegita finally acquired
the ability to turn into a Super Saiya-Jin.  This Vegita has blond hair instead
of his usual jet-black.  You never fight SSj Vegita in the Story Mode -
instead, Vegita automatically becomes SSj Vegita when you reach the Androids,
and remains so for the duration of the game.

---Move List---
Surprise, surprise!  SSj Vegita has NO different moves than that of Non-SSj
Vegita.  Sorry...

---Overall---
Look at what I suggested for regular Vegita (V-C).


-------------------------
* ---V-M: Perfect Cell---
-------------------------

Cell was created to absorb Artificial Humans #17 and #18 in order to achieve
his "perfect" form.  he managed to surprise #17, and due to Kuririn's desire to
NOT blow up #18, Cell managed to absorb her as well.  This Cell was incredibly
powerful.  Thus having reached his perfect state, Cell had a quandry - what
should he do now?  He'd accomplished what his programming stipulated, so what
should he do now?  Cell decided - he took over the Boudokai and changed it to
the "Cell Games", a new fighting contest.  The rules were simple - everyone who
showed up would fight Cell.  If they lost, the next person would fight him.  If
Cell defeated everyone, then he would blow up the world.  If Cell lost, then he
lost.  Cell, in a fairly close match, defeated Gokuu.  The next contender was
Gohan, whom wouldn't fight all out.  Cell, interested in finding out what kind
of "hidden powers" the boy had, released several Cell Juniors to beat up on his
friends (Vegita held his own, but everyone else got beat around).  Cell,
seeking to infuriate the boy, proceeded to step on #16's head, silencing the
Robot forever.  This drove Gohan to the edge, causing him to transform to SSj
level 2.  This Gohan bet the ever-lovin' tar out of Cell, hitting him so hard
he puked up #18 (whom Kuririn promptly rescued).  Cell, whom had dropped back
to an imperfect form (from the lost of #18) and bewildered at the sudden change
of tide in the fight, decided to commit suicide and blow up the world.  Gokuu,
sacrificing himself, grabbed Cell and teleported him to Kai-oh Sama's planet
(sacrificing him too).  Unfortunately, the explosion didn't kill Cell - it only
made him stronger, restoring him to his Perfect Form.  Gohan, with a little
help from Vegita, managed to overpower Cell again, this time atomizing him in a
massive Kamehame-ha.

Perfect Cell is the last person you fight in the Story Mode.  He has an
all-white face with black stripes, and sports a sort of "upgraded" version of
Imperfect Cell's suit.  His crest has become a hat, his skin has become an
armor of sorts, and his stinger tail is now concealed by the "wing flaps" on
his back.

---Move List---

TOWARDS, DOWN + B (While in air) = Dive Kick.  Cell, just like most everyone
else in the game (it seems), can do a diving kick.  Same old, same old - good
priority, nice speed, good for dodging or countering attacks, yadda yadda
yadda.  8/10 (4/5 x 2)

AWAY-DOWN, TOWARDS-UP + B = Cell Spin.  Cell flips upward towards his opponent,
does an elbow drop as he returns to the ground (or aerial level), then kicks
again.  My goodness, look at the power behind this attack!  Cell, during his
flip, strikes many times, each hit doing incredible damage WHEN CHIPPED.  This
is the "Gill's Ascension" move of the game, folks - blocked or not, you're
going to take a pounding when Cell does it.  That, combined with the
invincibility during the flip, make Cell an friggin' GOD with 1 move alone! 
8/10  (3/5, 6/5)

AWAY, DOWN + B = Modified Sliding Trip.  Cell slides forward, hitting low with
his front foot.  This attack is, essentially, a modified version of Imperfect
Cell's sliding Tail strike; the modification comes in due to the fact that Cell
no longer has a long tail to strike with.  Therefore, he uses the next best
thing - his foot.  Knockdown ability, decend damage, and it comes out quickly. 
7/10 (4/5, 3/5)

TOWARDS, DOWN, AWAY + B = Vaccuum Grab 'n Slam.  Cell grabs his opponent using
a brief bout of telekinesis (up-close), then boots them away.  This attack has
minor Vaccuuming abilities, sucking in enemies from a brief distance away
(about 1/4th of a screen).  The kick itself has Knockback to it.  Decent
damage, but horrible priority - I got beat out by Dr. Gero's Absorbing Attack
while using this!  5/10 (3/5, 2/5)

DOWN, AWAY + A = Renzoku Energy Dan.  Cell lets loose with 3 powerful bolts of
energy.  Man, you want to talk about NICE?  Try this on for size - Cell's bolts
travel just as fast and far as everyone else's, except his do a TON more
damage!  In all seriousness, having all 3 blasts connect takes off 100% of 1
bar.  That's NUTS!!!  11/10 (5/5, 6/5)

% DOWN, AWAY, TOWARDS + A = Hyper Mankaksopoppo.  Cell charges up with one
hand, then fires off a Modified Mankaksopoppo - this one has repeated bursts of
energy travelling up the corkscrew beam!  This attack, for as damaging as it
looks, is just a regular ol' Weak Super Ki Blast (lots of adjectives
there...regular, old, weak, super, Ki, whew!).  Something else I'd like to add
- for some odd reason, I can NEVER seem to pull this move off!  The in-game
movelist says that it's DOWN, DOWN-AWAY, AWAY, TOWARDS + A, but that NEVER
seems to work for me - I always throw the Renzoku Energy Dan.  Is it just my
game?  6/10 (3/5 x 2)

%%% AWAY, DOWN, TOWARDS + A = Double-Handed Great Bomb.  Cell charges up energy
in both hands, then continues to charge it up over his shoulder as if he were
holding a bag on his back.  He then lets loose with an extremely powerful ball
of energy at his opponent.  The reason this attack gets 3 Percentages is
because, unlike other Strong Super Ki blasts, this one takes off a full 1 and
1/2 bars of life (that's friggin' HUGE!) for the same cost as a regular ol'
Strong Super Ki blast (AGAIN with the adjectives!).  Do what you can to avoid
having this hit you, folks, or you're done for - this attack pretty much
guarantees the match (unless you're Dr. Gero, in which you're just wasting your
time and helping him out).  9/10 4/5, 5/5)

---Overall---
Perfect Cell is an overpowered monster of a character.  His attacks do an
absurd amount of damage, he's quick for being a large character, and he has a
few attacks that allow him to avoid you or get rid of you extremely well.  I'm
sorry, but to so thoroughly unbalance the game by making one character (this
one) this overpowered is - I'll say it - cheap.  Come on, that is SO unfair...I
mean, SSj 2 Gohan was able to beat him, so why isn't he on a par with Cell? 
Huh?  Goodness, next time don't unravel all of your work just to make the
character more difficult to beat, just give him a new move or two!  Stupid
programmers...

* ---V-N: Mister Satan---
-------------------------

During the lull in between the defeat of Cyborg Furiza and the arrival of the
Artificial Humans, there had been a Tenkai-Ichi Boudokai that none of the
Z-Senshi competed in.  Because of the lack of competition, practically anyone
with some fighting skill could have won.  Sadly, this was the case, as the
winner of the competition was a man named Mr. Satan.  Promoting a strange style
of wrestling, Mr. Satan so thoroughly trounced his advarsaries that the rest of
the world proclaimed him their savior.  3 years later, when the next Scheduled
Boudokai was to be held, Perfect Cell took over and proclaimed that instead of
a Boudokai, there would be the Cell games - all competitors would face off
against him in a 1-on-1 match until there were no more competitors, or Cell had
been beaten.  All of the Z-Senshi showed up for this game, as well as Mr. Satan

---Move List---

PICK MR. SATAN - by Picking Mr. Satan, you will see the mighty one attack Cell
without even hurt him, then get smacked away with the mere flick of Cell's
hand.

PICK MR. SATAN AGAIN - by Picking Mr. Satan after he's been hit away, he'll
complain of a stomach ache and avoid the match.


---Overall---
Overall, Mr. Satan is good for a quick laugh.  Let's hear it for Mr. Satan!

     ------------------------VI: Various------------------------
----------------------------Super Butoden----------------------------


Aside from parts A and B, these are the sections that really don't fit in with
any of the other parts of this guide.  Therefore, here are the various other
parts of the FAQ, all ready for you to browse through and laugh at!


-------------------------------
---VI-A:  Special Move Ranks---
-------------------------------

The reason I'm putting this section in is so I can list each move based off of
their ranks, then discuss why they are where they are.  Ok?  Great.

---Movement Ranking---

Rank     Reasoning

6/5:     It requires 1 button press, and therefore is as easy as it gets.
Why:     You only have to press 1 button!  It really doesn't get much simpler
         than that.

5/5:     Any move that requires a simple Quarter-Circle motion.
Why:     The motion is simple for most everyone - you just roll your thumb
         across the directional pad and press the attack button.  It's become
         a standard in the fighting-game community, so hopefully you should
         be a master of it by not.  If not, then it's certainly not hard to
         learn.

4/5:     Any move that is a simple half-circle or 2 back-forth movements on
         the directional pad [AWAY, TOWARDS] or [TOWARDS, AWAY] has a 4/5
         rating.
Why:     In other words, if you only had to roll from AWAY to DOWN to
         TOWARDS (or TOWARDS to DOWN to AWAY), then the move was considered
         simple enough to warrant a 4/5 rating.  Think of it as a Quarter-
         Circle (which is extremely easy) with an added movement to press.
         In the case of the AWAY, TOWARDS (and vice versa) movements, it's
         not quite as simple as a Quarter-Circle, but it's still fairly easy
         to pick up and master.

3/5:     Any move with [AWAY-DOWN, TOWARDS-UP] or [DOWN, AWAY, TOWARDS] or
         [TOWARDS, AWAY, TOWARDS], as well as Gohan's Kamehame-Ha [AWAY,
         DOWN, TOWARDS] has arating of 3/5.
Why:     Generally speaking, these moves are the ones that require odd-angle
         directions, 2+ back-forth movements on the Directional Pad, or a
         quarter-circle followed by the opposite direction.  In the case of
         Gohan's Kamehame-ha, it was dropped a notch because of how close it
         is to his other Super Ki blast.  That dropped the movement rating
         for both of 'em.

2/5:     Super Meteo Bashing [AWAY, DOWN, TOWARDS, UP]
         Modified Jumping Knee - Jumping Drop [AWAY-DOWN, UP]
         Gohan's Masenkou [AWAY, DOWN, DOWN-TOWARDS]
Why:     The Super Meteo Bashing requires the full circle, which isn't very
         easy to pull off...however, it IS possible, and is far more likely
         to work than Kai-oh Ken.  The Modified Jumping-Knee usually ends up
         being the regular Jumping Knee, making it frustrating to pull off.
         Finally, Masenkou is just too darn close to Gohan's Kamehame-Ha!

1/5:     Gokuu's Kai-oh Ken [charge DOWN for 2 seconds, UP]
Why:     No question here...this attack hardly ever works simply because the
         charging time is spotty.


---Usefulness---

I seriously considered making a Usefulness list like I did with the movement
list, but that seemed a little redundant - after all, isn't that what I did for
the individual character move list?


------------------
---VI-B: Cheats---
------------------

1 - Mirror Matches:  Want to be able to play as 2 of the same player in
Multiplayer Mode?  Great!  During the introduction sequence (that starts off
with Gokuu talking), hold down L and R on the control pad.  Got that much?  Ok,
now start rotating your thumb on the Directional Pad Clockwise while you rotate
you thumb across the A, B, X, Y buttons in a Counter-Clockwise motion.  You
MUST be holding down L and R the entire time or else it won't work.  Simply
keep this up until you hear a sound.  This means you've initiated
Mirror-Matches.

2 - The 5 Hidden Characters:  So, you're tired of the usual 8 players, and want
to get your groove on with the 5 hidden characters?  That's simple - look
directly above at the Mirror Matches code.  Now, after you hear the sound, keep
rotating the directional pad and the buttons (while holding down L and R).  Do
this until you hear Gokuu yell.  When he does, that means you've unlocked the 5
remaining characters - SSj Gokuu, SSj Vegita, Mirai Trunks, Chibi Gohan, and
Perfect Cell!

3 - Unlocking Mr. Satan:  Ok, so you don't really get to play as Mr. Satan. 
You can still view the overblown Arrogant Wrestler getting beat up by Cell!  In
order to do so, you must first have the game's difficulty setting at 3 or 4. 
Now, you must progress through the story mode of the game, winning each battle
with a certain character.  The correct order is this:

Stage 1 Vs. Piccolo        = Gokuu
Stage 2 Vs. Vegita         = Gokuu
Stage 3 Vs. Furiza         = SSj Gokuu
Stage 4 Vs. Dr. Gero       = Piccolo
Stage 5 Vs. #18            = SSj Vegita
Stage 6 Vs. Imperfect Cell = Piccolo
Stage 7 Vs. #16            = SSj Gokuu
Stage 8 Vs. Mirai Trunks   = SSj Vegita
Stage 9 Vs. Chibi Gohan    = SSj Gokuu
Stage 10 Vs. Perfect Cell   = Chibi Gohan

At this point, there will be a screen that says "The End".  Wait for a bit,
then the "Final Battle" will appear.  Here you have the option of choosing from
SSj Gokuu, Chibi Gohan, or the almighty Mr. Satan!

---VI-C: Revision History---
----------------------------

07-16-01:  Started this FAQ.
08-08-01:  After much deliberation (and many, MANY foul-ups), I finished this
           FAQ.  'bout friggin' time, too!


------------------
---VI-D: Thanks---
------------------

~CJayC (CJayC@gamefaqs.com, www.gamefaqs.com) for putting this FAQ up.  Your
hard work as earned my respect.

~Al Amaloo (www.gamewinners.com) for being such a cool guy, and having a great
site.  Your tenacity will live forever!

~Vertsk8pro@hotmail.com for giving me a heart attack with your childish "I
stole your FAQ and sold it with my name on it" antics.  Because of that, I now
do dozens of things to make sure people don't steal my work.  If they do, I
know exactly what to look for to see if they took MY work or not.

~Uh...I can't exactly thank God for the role he's taken in my life, because
that would seem like I'm trying to force my religious opinions on someone else
(which I'm not).  Therefore, I'd like to thank "Murray" for the role he's taken
in my life (Murray, you know who you are).

----------------------
---IV-E:  NO THANKS---
----------------------

If you write me asking for help with the game, I'll send you a link to my FAQ. 
If you ask for specific help, I'll try to aid you.  However, if you ask me
about something that is already covered in the FAQ, I will simply refer you to
the FAQ again.  I wrote the FAQ so that your questions would be answered here,
not so I could repeat that FAQ bit by bit through e-mail for the next few
years.  If you need clarification about something in the FAQ, ask about it -
but don't ask me to repeat anything.

If you're asking for help against a specific enemy, the only thing I have to
suggest is to watch what the other guy does, then see if you can figure out how
to get around it and/or counter it.  I don't know your fighting style, so I
can't make suggestions based off of assumptions.  Finally, do NOT e-mail me
telling me your fighting style, then saying that I have to help you because
"Now you know my fighting style" because I will ignore you altogether.  I do
not appreciate people looking for a loophole in my work, so don't even bother.

And if you happen upon this FAQ at sites other than these:

www.GameFAQ s.com
www.Gamewinner s.com

Then please tell me ASAP!
