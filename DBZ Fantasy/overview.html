              Budoukai - Overview</font></b></font></p>
            <p>So, what is the Tenkaichi Budoukai? Well, it is a tournament with 
              extreme masters of martial artists that compete to see, who is the 
              greatest among those who have showed up, to show who is proven to 
              be the strongest. It is held every three years on Papaya Island 
              on May 7th. As some of you have who have watched the dub, you have 
              seen flashbacks that were never made. In some instances, they show 
              a Tenkaichi Budoukai scene. If you ever wondered where they were 
              fighting, well, that was the place. Who knew, that, while fighting 
              all those villains on Earth and Namek, that they all practically 
              met each other in that small arena? However, there have been some 
              years that no one has gone to the Tenkaichi Budoukai for some time. 
              Eleven years went by between the 23rd and 24th Tenkaichi Budoukais, 
              for the arena to be rebuilt by, ahem, Goku and Piccolo's little 
              fight. Seven years had to go by between the 24th and the 25th, due 
              to the Cell Game. Also, the four years that happened to go by the 
              25th and 26th Tenkaichi Budoukais, because of the infamous Majin 
              Buu. Due to the great intense of the Budoukai, a prize was meant 
              for the strongest one that happened to show up. Usually, the prize 
              was 50,000 zeni to about 500,000 zeni. That's quiet allot. All in 
              all those times, many new people conquered feats no one else could, 
              as did some over come those. If you think that is all it's about, 
              think again!<br>
