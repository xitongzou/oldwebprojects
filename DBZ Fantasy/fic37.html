The Legend – Chapter 1


Goku! Goku! WAKE UP! ! ! ! YOUR FRIENDS ARE HERE! ! ! ! DON'T MAKE ME COME UP 
THERE! ! ! ! 
"GET DOWN HERE. . . .YOUR BREAKFAST IS READY" she yelled again."  Ok ok I'll be 
down in a minute" replied the Saiyan. 
"So what are you guys doing here?" Chi Chi asked Krillin and Trunks.  "Oh we’re 
just here to see if Goku wanted to do some sparing." said the Saiyan Trunks."  
Why must you guys always insist on training?  There's no reason for it" said Chi 
Chi.  "Chi Chi, Trunks and Goku are Saiyans; it's in their blood to fight.  Plus 
I like to see how I compare to them" answered Krillin.  Goku raced down the 
steps as he does every morning when breakfast is made.  Chi Chi put some fried 
fish on the table that Goku had caught the day before.  He sat in the chair 
almost knocking over the table, he didn't even seem to notice that Krillin and 
Trunks were standing inside. 
He inhaled his food in a matter of seconds.  Chi Chi, Krillin, and Trunks looked 
on in shock.  Even though they knew how Goku ate, they still seemed amazed.  
"Ah. . .Goku" Krillin said quietly.  "Oh hey guys what are you doing here?" Goku 
asked happily.  "Krillin and I wanted to know if you wanted to come and spar a
little" asked Trunks.  "Alright it will give me a chance to test out my power" 
Goku answered, as he rose from the table.  "Hey Chi Chi, where's Gohan?" asked 
Goku curiously.  "He's at school" answered Ch Chi.  "Alright lets go guys" said 
Goku.  Goku,Krillin, and Trunks walked out the door and levitated off the
ground.  "Wait what are you doing?  You’re supposed to help me clean up"  she 
screamed at the trio.  "I know you can hear me" she screamed again.  But they 
flew off with no attention to the screams.  "I hate when he does that" she 
remarked to herself.
They headed towards their usual fighting ground which was marked with the 
battles that had taken place over time.  "Hey guys we should get Vegeta, Yamcha, 
and Piccolo?  They would probably be angry if we didn't."  "Ok Trunks you get 
Vegeta, Krillin you get Yamcha, and I'll get Piccolo" suggested Goku.  The 
warriors surrounded themselves in ki and took off in different directions.


Meanwhile at Gohan's school. . . . . . . . . .

He was in his class fast asleep; the teacher was aking questions to the class.  
"Gohan. . . Gohan" said the teacher trying to wake up the small boy.  His head 
moved back and forth, his eyes slowly opened and he sat up.  "Gohan"said the 
teacher again.  "Yes" Gohan replied in a tired voice.  "What is the answer?" 
asked the teacher.  "I don't know" said Gohan.  "Gohan, sleeping is not for the 
classroom, so stay awake and pay atention.  The answer is 165" stated the 
teacher.  The boy looked around trying to gather his thoughts.  "Do you ever go 
through a class without falling asleep?" asked Videl, who sat beside him.
"Well yeah, but I choose not too" replied Gohan. 
"Ok students the homework for today is read pages 25 to 38 and do questions 1 to 
15" stated the teacher.  She always gave out lots of work. The kids complained 
about it but it never seemed to sway the teachers decision on the matter.  The 
bell rang and the kids rushed out of the class.  Gohan and Videl were the first 
two out the door.  They ran down the long halls trying to beat everyone out of 
the school.  Dozens of kids filled the hall.  Gohan and Videl ran down the hall 
trying to avoid the rush.  They pushed open the door and the sun nearly blinded 
them.  It was a bright day, the street was busy with cars.  Kids were playing in 
the streets and runing home.
The two had been attending public school for a while.  Gohan had been an outcast 
since he arrived at school; he didn't know if it was his looks or that he had a 
tail, but the boys were always picking on him.  Videl was his only friend.  "Ok 
I have to go" said Videl.  "Ok I'll see you later" Gohan replied.  As they 
walked away some kids moved around Videl. "Hey what are you doing hanging
around with the freak" the boy asked sharply.  "He's my friend" she answered.  
The boys started to push her around "Help Gohan" she yelled.
Gohan turned around quickly, he droped his bag and ran towards the boys.  The 
one boy saw him heading at them and stuck his foot out and triped him.  He hit 
the ground with a thud, his chin scraped on the pavement, and blood driped down.  
The boys all turned to Gohan, he slowly got up.  "Oh look it's the freak, look 
at that tail" he said.  Two of the boys were holding Videl back.  "What do you 
want?" said Gohan trying to contain his anger.  "Your going to pay" the one boy 
told Gohan.  And they moved around him.  The one boy kicked him in the gut, then 
the another boy kicked him, he caughed up some blood. Videl started to cry and 
begged them to stop.
They backed up a bit.  Gohan stood up and another boy clinched his fist and 
punched Gohan and he fell back to the ground.  Blood started to drop from his 
mouth.  Gohan tried to contain his anger so he wouldn’t reveal his powers.  He 
got up and punched one boy in the stomach and kicked another.  One boy grabed 
his tail and Gohan droped to the ground and became paralized, as does any saiyan 
that it occurs to.  The one boy continued to hold his tail and the others kicked 
him a couple more times.  Then they stopped.  "You better watch your back from 
now on kid" said the boy in an angry voice.  They let go of Videl and Gohan and 
walked away.  "Gohan are you ok?" she asked Gohan in a concerned voice.
Videl had tears dripping down her face and off her chin.  Gohan's eyes were 
barely open, blood was steaming down his face.  "Someone help!" Videl screamed 
out.  Someone ran to them.  "What happened to him?" the man asked.  "S. . . . 
Some kids beat him up" she answered.  "He's in pretty bad shape" he replied.  
Then just as the man was about to pick him up he saw a tail, a look of shock
came over his face.  "Sorry, but I'm not going to help a freak" he said as he 
sat up and began to walk away.  "What, where are you going?" she asked the man.  
"Vi . . . .Videl . . .(cough). . check the right hand side of my school bag . . 
. (cough . .cough). . . there should be a senzu bean in there" he struggled to 
say.  A senzu bean could fully restore a person's strength.  He kept one around 
for such an occasion.  Videl ran over to where Gohan dropped it, and she checked 
pocket after pocket.
Then she found it at the bottom under some books.  She ran back over to him and 
gave him the senzu bean. He chewed it slowly and he could feel his energy coming 
back, he wiped the blood from his chin and stood up.  "Man if it wasn't for 
those things I'd be in real trouble" he said with a sigh of relief.  "So you’re
ok then" Videl asked.  "Yeah I'm fine" he replied.  "Those guys are going to be 
sorry tomorrow" he said harshly.  "No Gohan, don't resort to their level, 
they’re idiots"she replied.  "I'll try not to, but I'm not sure" said Gohan.  
They walked down the street and on to a back road.  No one was around there, 
Videl's house was just down the road.  "Ok I should get going, my mom is 
probably worried" said Gohan.  "Hey Gohan you said you would teach me to fly" 
said Videl.  "Yeah we'll do that some other time" said Gohan.  Gohan 
checked back and forth to make sure no one could see him, then he levitated off 
the ground and shot off like a bullet, the force of Gohan blew Videl's hair back 
behind her head.
"I want to be able to fly like that" she said quietly to herself.  She took a 
couple of steps and stopped again.  "I bet he's avoiding trying to teach me, but 
I'll get him" she said.  Then she ran down the path way to her house. 

A couple of miles away. . . . . . . . . . .

Goku arrived at Piccolo's usual meditating area.  It was right beside a water 
fall surrounded by trees.  He was trying to sense Piccolo's power, but he 
couldn't.  Then Piccolo appeared behind him and tried to punch him, but Goku 
sensed it and caught his fist.  "You'll have to be quicker than that to get me" 
Goku remarked.
"You’re just lucky that I wasn't trying" said Piccolo.  He had a smile on his 
face.  He was wearing his usual outfit.  "Well since you seem to be in a 
fighting mood, do you. . . ." but before he could finish.  "I know 
what you came here for" he stated.  "Well then lets go" Goku said.  The two 
surrounded themselves in ki and took off in the direction of the fighting 
ground.
A couple of miles south-east, Trunks was looking for Vegeta. He found him 
staring into the distance on top of a cliff.  It was an isolated area, rocks 
sticking up out of the ground like small mountains.  He lowered himself behind 
his father.  "Father" Trunks said.  "What is it boy" he answered sharply.
"Goku and the others are going to do some sparring and were wondering if you 
wanted to join"said Trunks.  "Ah Kakarott, always thinking of others.  Alright 
I'll join, then I can show Kakarott that I have surpassed him. Make no mistake, 
if it comes to me and you, I will not show any mercy" stated Vegeta in a harsh
voice.  "And I won't expect any" Trunks replied.  And they took off in the 
direction of the battle field.

The Legend - Chapter 2


Krillin was the last to arrive at their destination. He landed on Master Roshi's 
Island, an air bike was parked in front of the house. "I wonder if Bulma's here" 
he thought to himself.
 
He walked in the door and saw Bulma, Master Roshi, and Yamcha. "Hey Krillin" 
everyone shouted.  " Hey Krillin what are you here for " asked Bulma. "Oh I'm 
just here to see Yamcha" said Krillin.  "What do you want to see me about?" he 
asked. "Do you want to come and spar?" asked Krillin.  "Sure" he replied. They 
were about to walk out the door. "Hey guy's take this with you" she said as she 
tossed an item to them. "Hey it's a scouter, where did you get this?" Krillin 
asked. " I just fixed an old one" answered Bulma. "Ok we better be on our way 
now" said Krillin. They opened the door walked out and flew off. Goku and 
Piccolo were the first to arrive, then Vegeta and Trunks, and finally Krillin 
and Yamcha. "Well finally, why are they even here? Their power is pathetic" 
Vegeta remarked to Goku about Yamcha and Krillin.  "Hey Krillin is that a 
scouter?" asked Goku. "Yeah Bulma was able to fix an old one" said Krillin. "Ok 
how are we going to do this, free for all or a tournament" asked Piccolo. "Let's 
make it a tournament" suggested Trunks. Everyone seemed to agree. "I get 
Kakorott" Vegeta demanded in a harsh voice. "No, I want to face you father" said 
Trunks. "Alright then Piccolo it's me and you. Hey Krillin, Yamcha are you two 
going to join?" asked Goku. "We would but we wouldn't stand a chance, I guess 
we'll just see how powerful you guys are" answered Krillin.

"Alright lets start, Trunks and Vegeta your first" said Goku. Vegeta and Trunks 
lowered to the ground, Trunks took off his capsule corp. jacket and threw it to 
Yamcha. Trunks started by disappearing out of sight, he reappeared behind Vegeta 
and attacked with a kick to Vegata's head, Vegeta was aware of the attack and 
ducked down then kicked out Trunk's one foot that was on the ground causing him 
to fall. Vegeta shot a weak ki blast but Trunks was able to spin out of the way, 
the blast created a dust cloud and Trunks vanished in it. Vegeta waited for him 
to come out. Trunks rushed from the dust and threw a punch at Vegeta, he moved 
to the right and kneed him in the gut. Trunks stopped and his eyes widened and 
he could feel blood fill his mouth. Vegeta delivered a kick straight to his jaw 
which sent Trunks into the air. Vegeta continued the assault and flew above him 
then smashed him down to the ground and gathered some ki and fired it at him. It 
caused an explosion that surrounded trunks. When the dust cleared he was 
standing with his arms crossed, he had successfully blocked the brunt of the 
attack but his skin along with his clothes were burned. "Hey Yamcha do you think 
Trunks can take much more of this?" asked Krillin. "I don't think so, man Vegeta 
has improved" answered Yamcha. Trunks stood with his arms crossed for a few more 
seconds, he let out a ferocious yell, he became covered in a red aura, pieces of 
rock broke from the ground and lifted into the air. "Wow his power keeps going 
up . . . 40,000. . . 50,000. . . 60,000" said Krillin as he read the power level 
with the scouter. When Trunks was finished powering up, the rocks fell to the 
ground, then he looked at Vegeta with confidence in his eyes. " Ah, you are more 
powerful than I thought, but it won't be enough. Now watch how it's done" said 
Vegeta as he grinned. Vegeta started to yell much like Trunks and he also became 
covered in a aura as he started to power up. Krillin was reading Vegeta's level 
on the scouter. " His power is amazing, it's. . 85,000. . .97,000" Krillin 
stated. Trunks looked on in shock. Vegeta lunged at Trunks, Trunks tried to 
punch him, but Vegeta was easily able to move out of the way and countered with 
a sharp kick to his side, then he unleashed a furry of punches and kicks. Trunks 
staggered back and Vegeta charged some ki and raised his hand towards Trunks, 
then blasted him to the ground, the force of the impact drove Trunks into the 
ground. " Ok, stop Vegeta, Trunks is done. Krillin get a senzu bean down to him" 
shouted Goku. Krillin flew down and brought a bean to Trunks. He could feel his 
strength return and his wounds heal, then he took to the air and flew up beside 
Goku. " Alright Goku it's me and you now" stated Piccolo as he took off his 
cape. The two dropped down to the ground and stood in a fighting pose. " 
Whenever you're ready Piccolo" said Goku. Piccolo started by flying towards Goku 
and tried to punching him, but Goku was able to block in time with his one arm, 
Goku retaliated with a punch but Piccolo was able to see it and duck, Piccolo 
flew backwards and fired ki ball. Goku was able to dodge to the right, and then 
Goku raced towards Piccolo and kicked at his head. Piccolo grabbed his foot and 
swung him around, but Goku kicked him with his other foot, he backed up a couple 
of feet and they both stopped.  "You're pretty good Piccolo, shall we continue?" 
asked Goku. "Unless you want to quit" replied Piccolo. The two continued the 
fight with a fury of punches and kicks. Both of them connected with each others 
fists numerous times. Then Piccolo landed a punch to Goku's face, Goku did the 
same to Piccolo, and delivered a hard punch to Piccolo's stomach which caused 
Piccolo to gasp for air, but he still managed to uppercut Goku into the air. 
Then Piccolo put his hands close to each other and started to charge an attack, 
he fired it at Goku. Goku regained his senses again and caught the attack. It 
still pushed him back, then Goku threw it back at Piccolo, his eye's opened 
sharply and the attack collided with Piccolo in a massive explosion which sent 
Piccolo crashing to the ground. "Kakarott wins" Vegeta stated in a harsh tone. 
Krillin flew down and gave a bean to Piccolo. He stood up and flew to Goku. 
"Good luck against Vegeta" said Piccolo. "Yeah I might need it" replied Goku. 
Vegeta stayed in the air and Goku went to the ground. They both stared at each 
other for a few moments. Then Vegeta shot a weak ki blast at Goku, he zanokened 
behind Vegeta and fired a small ki ball of his own, but Vegeta backhanded it to 
the sky, it exploded and lit up the sky. Goku tried to cover his eyes, when he 
looked up Vegeta was not around, Goku started concentrated on locating Vegeta. 
He appeared behind Goku and punched him to the ground. Goku regained his senses 
and stopped himself a few inches above it. Vegeta flew down towards Goku then 
zanokened at Goku's side and attempted a straight kick, but Goku caught Vegeta's 
foot and smashed him into the flat land a couple of times then he threw him into 
the air. Goku followed up it up appearing ahead of Vegeta and putting his hands 
together like he was holding an axe and pounded down on Vegeta's back, the force 
knocked him down making a large circular dent in the ground. "Hey Krillin get a 
senzu bean down to Vegeta" he said. Krillin was about to fly down to him but 
then he stopped. He reached into the bag and tossed one to Goku, then he 
continued to Vegeta. 

When he landed beside him he was scared to get close thinking Vegeta would 
attack. Vegeta struggled to stand up. Krillin watched carefully. He put a bean 
in his hands and offered it to Vegeta. "Get away from me, I don't need one of 
those disgraceful beans as my aid, I will heal on my own" he said causing 
Krillin to jump back about a foot. Vegeta slowly lifted off the ground and flew 
off. Trunks was about to fly after him but Goku interrupted. "No Trunks, don't 
follow him" said Goku. "But.." Trunks started to say when he realized that 
Vegeta is in a constant bad mood to begin with, but when he loses a battle his 
pride is hurt and that's a time you don't want to be anywhere near him. "Hey 
Krillin, Yamcha, what will you do now?" he asked. "Well, we were probably going 
to spar at Kami's" answered Yamcha. "We would stay here and fight you but you 
wouldn't stand a chance" said Krillin in a sarcastic tone. Everyone seemed to 
laugh at that, except for Piccolo who just cracked a smile. "Bye" said Krillin 
and Yamcha as they took off.
