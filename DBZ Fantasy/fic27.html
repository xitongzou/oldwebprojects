<EM>Author's Notes:</EM>
<P>This story was written 'cuz I bored out of my mind and 
needed something to stay awake. When reading this keep in mind that this is 
made up as I go along, I put very little effort in this.

<P>Hey wait a minute! That didn't sound right.

<P>Oh, yeah. I worked really hard on this and it took all of the brain power I 
had in me(which isn't saying a lot).

<P>Damn, I just keep insulting myself, don't I?

<P>Well anyway, enough with the bullshit, I need to get on with the freakin 
story before you decide this is not worth it and close this damn 
window......

<H3 align=center>The Awakening<BR>
By: Chrono<BR><BR>
Chapter 1</H3>

<P>One day Gohan was flying through the mountains. He remembers on how that 
algebra was just to hard for him. "Oh, well." He thought. "I'm sure Mom wont 
get TOO mad. I needed a break!" He was on his way to Mr. Piccolo's 
"house"(author's note: Hey wait a minute, He doesn't have one!). He wanted 
to train some more he thought, but he couldn't fool himself. He wanted to 
get away from his bitchy mother!

<P>He was almost there, lakes and streams sparkling below him. As he entered 
the mountain, he had to fly higher. He knew he must be getting close, for he 
could sense Piccolo's high power. He wanted to have some fun, so he returned 
to low ground and started dodging and flying around the high mountains.

<P>He saw a happy family swimming in a nearby lake, and he saw that there was a 
man there with them, who was obviously his father. "Dad, I wish you were 
here." Gohan said to himself. He had flown quite a long way, and was very 
thirsty, so he flew down to the ground to take a sip of the spring water.

<P>"Mmm, this is good!" Gohan said happily. He stood straight up, nodded and 
was about to take off.

<P>"He-helllp me! He-elp me!" He heard. He looked over to his left, but nothing 
but dirt was over there. He looked to his right, and saw a little boy 
drowning in the water.

<P>Gohan looked over at the Dad of the family, and saw him just standing there 
like a frozen statue, worried. This angered Gohan.

<P>He decided he must do something, and would deal with the so-called Father 
later. He flew over to the helpless boy, near death, and pulled him out of 
the water. Gohan took him over to the sand, and laid him down.

<P>He looked over at the Mom and her daughters, and saw them crying. He looked 
over at the father, and gritted his teeth and let out a growl.

<P>Gohan put his ear over the little boy's chest and heard nothing. He gave him 
CPR(Gohan enjoyed the mouth-to-mouth.....okay, I'm kidding!). The boy 
caughed up some water and got up slowly. His mom and sisters came running 
over to his aid.

<P>"Oh, Baby are you all right?" His mother asked.

<P>Gohan got up and walked toward the little boys dad.

<P>"Why didn't you save him?" Gohan said with anger.

<P>For a moment there was silence, the guy just stood there looking at Gohan. 
There was a long period of silence, then it broke.......

<P>"Thank you." The guy said, obviously not sincere.

<P>"You're not welcome." Gohan replied back. He asked him again, "Why didn't 
you save him?"

<P>There was more silence.

<P>"ANSWER ME!!" Gohan said now very angry.

<P>The man gave out a short, "hmph" and turned his head and walked away. This 
seriously provoked Gohan.

<P>Gohan now showing pure hatred for the man, walked along with him and grabbed 
his shoulder and spun him around.

<P>"Get your fucking hands off me you little freak!" The man said, and punched 
Gohan across the face, leaving a bruise.

<P>Gohan just stood there, then turned over to see the mother and girls still 
over at the boy.

<P>"You are scum." Gohan said sharply, then breifly hit the man in his stomach, 
seriously hurting him.

<P>The man gasped and fell to his knees. Gohan figured he'd tought that man a 
lesson, and flew off.

<P>He would never find out how that man lived his life afterwards, but 
something told him that the creep would live differently.

<P>Gohan flew a little faster now and was only about 20 miles from Piccolo. He 
studied the geography below him(he wasn't that good in social studies), and 
saw something shine brightly below him.

<P>He thought it might have been a quarter, so he continued on flying. "What 
good would a 25 cents do me anyway?"

<P>He was only around 10 miles to Piccolo now, but suddenly he felt Piccolo's 
power change to right behind him.

<P>He stopped in his tracks and looked for Piccolo, but he was nowhere insight. 
He looked in the direction of where he was originally flying, and felt 
Piccolo's power over there, and behind him. He thought it might have been 
another one of his Dad's friends so he turned around and flew over there 
some, until he was near the power.

<P>He again saw nothing, but looked over and saw that quarter he found earlier, 
so he landed.

<P>"Maybe I was destined to have this quarter" he said jokingly. He bent down 
and picked up of what he thought was the quarter but was something 
different.......

<P>"Shit" He yelled out to himself, and looked and his hand, and it was all 
bloody. He was in serious pain now. He looked back down and the "quarter". 
It became bigger and rose out of the ground. What he thought was a quarter, 
was in fact some thing different, something very different.......
