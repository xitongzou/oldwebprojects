<br>After Baby got defeated by Goku, he use his remainig power to send a 
help message to the pure evil Extreme Sayjin known as Barrot.
 But of course Goku did not know this. After Baby died 3 spacepods were 
sended to Earth from Barrot planet. And each spacepod has an Extreme 
Sayjin in it. (Extreme Sayjin is stronger than a pure sayjin.) The 
Extreme Sayjins are heading for earth and not even King Ki knows about 
it.   On Earth Goten and Chibbi Trunks are at the new WWFT. (World Wide 
Fighting Tournment.) Goten and Trunks are gettting ready for their first 
fight.  Trunks gets called first to fight this man called Wein. The bell 
rings and Wein runs towards Trunks in full speed and Trunks is so 
surprised by it that he just stands there and gets punched in the face 
by Wein. Trunks flies into the ropes, he gets up fast. He wipes is mouth 
and smiles one of those Vegeta smiles. Trunks runs toward him with his 
fist out, Wein stands there ready to counter attack but when Trunks is 
about 3 steps from impact he teleports behind him and kicks him in the 
back of the head, Wein flies out of the ring and hits th table where the 
Judges are sitting at. The bell rings and Trunks is declared the winner. 
Trunks leaves the ring and goes to Goten.<br>
<ul>
<li>Trunks: There's no competeion here,lets go.<br><br>
<li>Goten: No, I didn't get have my turn.<br><br>

<li>So Goten is callled up next, Goten gets in the ring with some skiny 
Kung Fu man. When the bell is about to get rung, some lady brings one of 
the judegs a message. The Judge reads it. He gets up and says.<br><br>

<li>Judge: This match is declared over, we have another chanlege for umm... 
Goten and his friends umm... Trunks, this will be a double match up. 
Goten and Trunks verus Sien and Wein. (not the one Trunks whipped on) 
This match will be held on the mountainside in one hour.<br><br>

<li>Trunks: Hopefully these two will be more competeion.<br><br>

<li>To be cointinued-<br><br>
