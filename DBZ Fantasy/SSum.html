<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragonball Z story starts off with a series/movie called the arrival. It's basically about Goku and his family heritage. Goku is flying to the Turtle Masters house for a reunion with all the characters from the original Dragonball movie, Krillin, Bulma, and Master Roshi. Upon arrival at the house everyone is surprised to see that Goku has a son named Gohan. After a few laughs, a Saiyan arrives by the name of Radditz. Radditz first encounters the Namek Piccolo. He toys with Piccolo, who is supposed to be the second most powerful person on the planet earth and an enemy of the Z fighters, and just before pounding the daylights out of the Namek his scouter finally finds Goku. Radditz rushes off to meet Goku, who we find out is Radditz younger brother and therefore making Goku a Saiyan, to ask why Kakarot, Goku's Saiyan name, has not prepared the planet earth for take over. Goku gets mad and Radditz makes off with Gohan, who Radditz uses to make Goku destroy the planet. Goku defies Radditz figuring that Radditz would kill his son anyway and gets ready to find Radditz and fight him, but just before he takes off Piccolo arrives and joins with Goku on his quest to kill Radditz. The two find Radditz, fight him, and get beat up. Gohan powers up and charges Radditz, breaking his Saiyan suit and weakening him enough for Goku to grab him and hold him while Piccolo fires a beam and kills Radditz and Goku. Goku dies and Radditz scouter sends the message that Piccolo tells Radditz before he dies. Piccolo tells Radditz that Goku will be back because off the mystical Dragonballs. Radditz tells Piccolo that the remaining Saiyans Now know about the Dragonball and will be on their way to find the Dragonballs. Piccolo decides to take Gohan and train him to fight so that the Saiyan-boy will be ready for the battle with the Saiyans Vegeta and Napa. Goku, who is now in another dimension, travels a road called snakes way to the martial arts master King-Kai. Piccolo trains Gohan how to fight and Goku reaches King-Kai. As Goku trains with King-Kai, who lives on a planet with a higher level of gravity than earth, and teaches Goku the art of the Kao-ken technique along with the special attack called the spirit bomb, Tien, Yumcha, Chausu, and Krillin begin training with the guardian of earth, Kami. After completing their training, the Z fighters gather to face off against the Saiyans Vegeta and Napa. Just as Piccolo finishes training Gohan the Saiyans arrive. Goku has finally mastered the all the arts of King-Kai and begins his journey back to the entrance of the dimension so he can return to earth, Bulma and Master Roshi had collected the Dragonballs and wished him back to life. Napa defeats Chausu, and Tien, while Yumcha was killed by the Cybamin, these little green gremlins who Piccolo destroys with beams from his mouth, Napa decides to fire a beam at Gohan and Piccolo jumps in front to save Gohan and dies. Goku Arrives and defeats Napa rather easily, Napa pleads to Vegeta for him to help, but the prince of all Saiyans helps Napa by sending him to another dimension. Goku takes Vegeta to a remote area to do battle without hurting anyone around. Vegeta begins to get the better of Goku in the beginning but Goku against King-Kai&#146;s wishes, uses the Kao-ken technique x3 and begins to turn the tables. Vegeta can't believe Kakarot is stronger than he is and decides to transform into the Saiyan-ape to defeat Goku. Gohan and Krillin follow them along with another fighter named Yajorobi, who is a very cowardly samurai but ironically saves Goku by cutting off Vegeta's tail transforming him back into human form. Vegeta who is still hurting from his battle with Goku, now has to face off against Gohan who powers up and begins to give Vegeta a run for his money; this scene is what makes Vegeta my favorite character because after getting trashed by Goku, then receiving more damage while an ape, is pretty weak and has to face off against a powered up Gohan, inspite off all this he goes and says to himself &#147;WHAT AN EPIC DAY&#148;. While Vegeta is fighting with Gohan, Goku manages to make a Spirit bomb and gives it to Krillin, who fires it, misses Vegeta, but Gohan Bounces it back and it finally hits Vegeta. Vegeta, weak and almost dead, decides to blow up planet earth. Gohan gets mad, his tail grows back and he transforms into an ape and sits on Vegeta. Vegeta crawls into his ship and takes off. Goku, Gohan, and Krillin go to a hospital for treatment. Now they must fly to Namek to get new Dragonballs to wish the dead Z fighters back to earth, When Piccolo died Kami died and along with them the Dragonballs of planet earth. Bulma, Gohan, and Krillin jump in a ship and fly off to the planet Namek. Goku, who is awaiting zenzu beans; mysterious beans that restores 100 percent of the person's health, stays back. Bulma and the guys arrive on the planet Namek and finds that someone else is looking for the Dragonballs. Freeza is already on the planet collecting Dragonballs for himself, while Vegeta is being rejuvenated on Freeza's home planet he breaks out, steals a ship and is off to planet Namek as well. </FONT><BR>
