            <p>The 28th Tenkaichi Budoukai</p>
            <p>The 28th Tenkaichi Budoukai was held in the year 784 A.D. and it 
              had a total of 114 fighters. The ending of this Budoukai was never 
              seen, but I will still go over what probably happened. The main 
              reason that Gokuh is entering the Budoukai is because of some super 
              powerful person who is also entering, but no one knows who. This 
              is there reason why the rest of the Z fighters join the Budoukai. 
              The brackets are set up so that there are 3 brackets of four people. 
              Whoever the survivor from the field of 10 is will end up facing 
              Mr. Satan for the World Championship. </p>
            <p>Before the Budoukai starts, The announcer announces the brackets 
              and then the fighters have some time to warm up and most of them 
              stand around and chat. Goten whines because he has to face Buu in 
              the first round and Mou Kekko is mad at having to only fight a little 
              girl. Noku comes up to Vegeta and tells him about how he will lose 
              and so on. So Vegeta, without even turning around punches Noku and 
              sends him flying across the arena and into a wall. </p>
            <p>The Tenkaichi Budoukai Starts </p>
            <p>The first match has Pan fighting Mou Kekko. The fight begins and 
              Pan jumps at Kekko and punches him. She then jumps at him again 
              and kicks him out of the ring to win the match. She bows and then 
              walks back to where the rest of the fighters are. </p>
            <p>The next match has Gokuh fighting Ubuu, who is supposed to be the 
              powerhouse Gokuh was looking for. As the match starts it is evident 
              that Ubuu is extremely nervous and neither of the two fighters start 
              to fight, but instead Gokuh is forced to insult Ubuu so that he 
              will fight. Finally after making fun of Ubuu's parents the boy starts 
              to react. Gokuh flies in and kicks the boy and now Ubuu is mad. 
              Ubb attacks Gokuh with a kick and a punch, but Gokuh gets away. 
              Gokuh is starting to see the boys power however. The two continue 
              to fight and they are destroying the ring not to mention each others 
              clothes. Finally in a fit of rage, Ubuu's Ki explodes out of him 
              and he blows Gokuh up into the air. Gokuh continues to stay in the 
              air, but then realizes that Ubuu can not fly yet. So he apologizes 
              and comes back down to the ground. Gokuh then tells his friends 
              that he will he will be leaving. Ubuu then gets on Gokuh's back 
              and they go off to train. That is the end to Dragonball Z, however, 
              we still have a Tenkaichi Budoukai going on, so let me just take 
              a stab at what happened and for all intensive purposes, this is 
              what happened. </p>
            <p>The Tenkachi Budoukai Continues, but this is only a prediction 
            </p>
            <p>The next match would have been Captain Chiken vs. Kirano. Now, 
              this is the only match which I can not say who the winner would 
              be, but to be honest it doesn't matter because whoever would win 
              would just lose to Buu in the next round. </p>
            <p>The next fight would be Goten vs. Mr. Buu and Mr. Buu would win 
              that match. The next match would have Trunks fighting against Otokosuki 
              and Trunks would win that match and the final 1st round match up 
              would be Vegeta vs. Noku and Vegeta would win that match. </p>
            <p>The Second Round </p>
            <p>Now, since Gokuh and Ubuu would leave, Pan would automatically 
              win her second round match and advance to the third round. Mr Buu 
              would fight Captain Chiken/Kirano and would win against either of 
              them. The next match would be Trunks vs. Vegeta and Vegeta would 
              win that match. </p>
            <p>The Third Round </p>
            <p>The Third and Fourth Round </p>
            <p>Now, Pan would fight against Mr. Buu to see who fought Vegeta and 
              Mr. Buu would win that match. Mr. Buu would then fight against Vegeta 
              and Mr. Buu would win. </p>
            <p>The Championship </p>
            <p>Mr. Buu and Mr. Satan would be the final two competitors. As usual 
              Mr. Buu would throw the match to Satan so that Satan could maintain 
              his good name. </p>
            <p>That is how the 28th Tenkaichi Budoukai would go if it would have 
              been finished. </p>
