 as The King of Darkness, he is the ruler of an alternate dark dimension.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Babidi locates him and possesses him, making him his loyal servant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>The Doubler’s ability to conjure weapons and turn people to stone with
 his spit make him a dangerous adversary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
 he outlives his usefulness, Buu toys with him a while, until he gets hungry and
 turns The Doubler into a cookie (which he eats immediately, of course).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

 </span>Dende is rescued by Krillin and Gohan, who protect the Namek boy
 throughout the Frieza Saga.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quiet
 and reserved, he has the power to heal even mortal wounds, and he uses it to
 save Krillin, Gohan, and even Vegeta during the battle with Frieza.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>As the only one around with the knowledge to activate the Namek
 Dragonballs, he reawakens Porunga so that Gohan can wish Piccolo to be alive
 and on Planet Namek.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dende and
 Gohan later become the best of friends, and they stay together on Earth until
 the Namek people are ready to move to Namek II, their new home planet.<span style="mso-spacerun:

 replacement Kami for Earth, at which point the Namek Elder Muuri suggests that
 Dende would make a good choice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dende
 returns with Goku as Earth’s new Kami, after which he powers up the
 Dragonballs, giving Shenlong the power to grant two wishes instead of one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

 previously final warrior of Uranai Baba, Akuman resembles a demon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>His special technique is awakening a person’s evil inside of them and
 with it, causing them to explode.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately
 for him, Goku is pure of heart, possessing no evil inside him, and the move is
 thus ineffective.<o:p>

 Planet Frieza #79, he is a small dinosaur-like creature with a tuft of bright
 red-orange hair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He monitors the
 rejuvenation tank while Vegeta is recovering from his battle with Goku, and
 later assists Vegeta as he prepares to depart for Namek.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

 soldiers, he looks like a fat pink blob with spikes over his body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>He doesn’t appear to be powerful, but for his size, his power and
 speed are remarkable.<span style="mso-spacerun:

 wicked task for Frieza.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Vegeta
 easily slays Dodoria with one blast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His

 Briefs – “Buriifu Hakase”</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span>&nbsp; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Bulma’s father, and
 the founder of the Capsule Corporation, he invented the Hoi Poi Capsules that
 allow fast and easy transportation of anything from small objects such as
 magazines to entire houses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Capsule
 Corp soon expanded to the vehicle industry and entered the world market of auto
 industry in 750 A.D.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At that time,
 Capsule Corp held 40% of the market to itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Its’ main competition was with the Red Ribbon Army, which held 16% of
 the market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By 778 AD, Capsule
 Corporation dominated the industry with 48% of the market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Although he is a genius, Dr. Briefs is somewhat absent-minded, eccentric
 to say the least.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He’s also a
 bit of a pervert, referring to the dirty magazines that Bulma discovered in
 some of his capsules.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A few of his
 greatest inventions were Goku’s modified Space Pod and Vegeta’s 400+g
 gravitron.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Briefs was born around the year 700 AD.<o:p>
 </o:p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Dr.
 Frappe*</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span>&nbsp; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Only mentioned briefly
 in Dragonball Movie 4, he is supposedly the creator of Android 8, but this
 becomes a plot-hole when paired with the series, where it is stated that Dr.
 Gero was Hatchan’s creator.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Dr.
 Gero - “Dokutaa Giro” (see Android Number 20)</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span>&nbsp; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A brilliant scientist,
 he is the mastermind behind the Red Ribbon Army.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>He constantly created new and better robots and androids in order to one
 day conquer the world.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>All of his hopes for world domination are crushed by the
 young Goku, who remained undefeated by even Dr. Gero’s most powerful and
 destructive creations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He is
 driven nearly insane by his desire to get revenge on Goku for eradicating the
 entire Red Ribbon Army.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He later
 creates Cell, by far his greatest creation of all time, by collecting DNA
 samples from the strongest fighters ever to set foot on the Earth, and
 combining them into one biological creation that takes many years to grow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Gero then quickly sets about building Androids 16, 17, 18 and 19
 (Although 16 was probably built before Gero had begun the Cell project), and
 later transplants his own brain into an android body built to look exactly like
 him so that he can continue his research.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>He is ultimately killed by Android 17 before he can see his perfect
 creation (Cell) arise and wreak havoc on the Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Android 17 kicks off the head of his master and creator, and then stomps
 on it, crushing his head (although the scene depicting blood oozing over the
 floor is probably a bit overdone, considering he’s a true android).<o:p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Dr.

 android assistant in DBZ Movie 2 “The World’s Strongest Man”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>He gathers the Dragonballs and frees Dr. Willow from his icy prison.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Even though he appears old and harmless, Dr. Koachin is actually
 well-equipped for fighting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
 hand can transform into a machine gun, while his staff can hurl energy blasts.<o:p>
 </o:p>

 </span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A deranged but brilliant
 scientist, he is thought to be the last surviving member of the Tsufurujin
 race, who returns to activate his people’s ultimate weapon against the
 Saiyajin, Baby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Myuu believes
 that he is “creating” Baby, while it is later discovered that he is only an
 android that was programmed to activate Baby when the time came.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Even so, there must have been some biological element to Dr. Myuu,
 because after he is destroyed, he appears later in GT as an ally of Dr. Gero in
 Hell, and together the two of them build “New” Android 17.<o:p>

 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A villain who appeared in two
 Dragonball Z home videos that were actually animated guides to two video games
 for a video game system that never came out in the United States, called the
 Playdia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither game was exactly
 terrific, but the interesting part is that the two home movies played out as a
 normal story of DBZ, but actually were guiding you through the game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Dr. Raichi is the villain of the games.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>He is a member of the Tuffle race, which the Saiyajin wiped out, and he
 returns to get revenge on the Saiyajin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Goku
 and the crew defeat him easily, since the only thing he has to protect him is a
 force field that Vegeta gets around by shooting a blast into the force field
 with him.<o:p>

 </span>&nbsp; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The main villain in DBZ
 Movie 2, “The World’s Strongest Man”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>He was a brilliant scientist who performed evil experiments with his
 android assistant Dr. Koachin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
 50 years before the start of Dragonball Z, horrible weather said to be sent
 from the gods sealed him in his laboratory in the Tsurumaitsuburi Mountains.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>His brain was transplanted into a large mechanical device that would
 keep him alive until the day when he could find the world’s strongest man and
 take control of his body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Goku
 finishes him off with the Genki Dama (Spirit Bomb).<o:p>

 </span>&nbsp; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">One of Uranai Baba’s
 ghostly fighters, he fights using the typical vampire techniques, sucking his
 opponent’s blood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He defeats
 Kryllan, but he loses to Upa and Puar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
 two use a combination of Puar’s transforming ability and Garlic Breath to
 defeat him.<o:p>

 Piccolo Daimaou’s evil spawn, Daimaou spits him out just as Tien arrives to
 try and trap Daimaou in the Denshi Jar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Drum
 attacks Tien, and clobbers him quite easily until Goku arrives, at which point

 the universe, she is the only female Kaio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>She looks similar to King Kai, but with a pink complexion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>She is somewhat haughty when it comes to the strength of her fighters,
 and she is very bossy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Before the
 Annoyoichi Budoukai begins, she teases King Kai because he’s dead, and later
 challenges Goku to a race to the other side of the “room” (a special room
 of the Grand Kai’s which appears to hold the entire universe inside it,
 though it actually does have limits).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
 Grand Kai intervenes by appearing at the end of the room and claiming himself
 to be the winner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the
 Annoyoichi Budoukai, the last of her fighters to fall out of the tournament is
 Arqua, who loses to Goku.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
 punishes her students for losing so early in the tournament by promptly
 ordering them to run a million laps around the stadium (which has to be
 enormous, considering the crowd consists of practically all the non-evil

 Sharpener and Videl.<span style="mso-spacerun:

 of the greatest threats to the entire universe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>He and his armies purge planets of life, and sell them to the highest
 bidder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or if he’s so inclined

 </span>Frieza sees himself as the most powerful being in the universe, with no
 equal (although his father King Cold and brother Cooler are both stronger).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>However, Frieza’s greatest fear was the Saiyajin race, not only
 because they were the strongest species he had ever encountered by far in all
 the universe, he also feared them because of an ancient legend among their
 people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was said that every few
 thousand years or so, a super-powerful Saiyajin was born to their people, the
 legendary Super Saiyajin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because
 the Saiyajin race was already so powerful and great in number, Frieza could not
 fathom how powerful a Super Saiyajin might be, and so he decided to employ
 them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Fearing for his people and
 his throne, King Vegeta went along with Frieza’s wishes for several years
 until he could form a plan to gather all the Saiyajin forces to fight as one
 against Frieza and defeat him once and for all. Before this can be accomplished
 in full, however, Frieza acts first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
 he feels that the Saiyajin are getting too strong, he simply destroys their
 home planet, Vegetasei, to prevent any more super powers that might possibly
 rival his own from being born.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Frieza
 has 3 transformations, each one more powerful than the last.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

 power level, until his final transformation, in which he can reach his maximum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

 there that Frieza finally meets his end by the blade of Trunk’s sword.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
