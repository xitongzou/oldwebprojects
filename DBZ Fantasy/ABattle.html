        Trunks &amp; Android Saga</p>
      <p>121. Trunks vs. Frieza's Henchmen</p>
      <p>After the scouters read Trunks' power level at a mere level 5, the henchmen 
        of cyber Frieza attacked, but each show was easily bounced away by Trunks' 
        superior strength. He then charged in, and sliced them all up with his 
        sword, killing them easily.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>122. SSJ Trunks vs. Cyber Frieza</p>
      <p>Turning to Frieza, Trunks turned SSJ, and toyed with the evil one for 
        a while, deflecting and catching the most powerful attacks and energy 
        balls/beams that Frieza could conjure up. He eventually killed the evil 
        one by using a Burning attack as a distraction, then charging in and slicing 
        him into many different pieces. As a final precaution, even though it 
        was somewhat of an overkill, Trunks used another burning attack, this 
        time on the floating pieces of what used to be Cyber Frieza, killing him 
        without a doubt.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>123. SSJ Trunks vs. King Cold</p>
      <p>Trunks' next target was King Cold, as he turned to the father of Frieza, 
        and slowly advanced. Cold bets Trunks' that without the sword he couldn't 
        have beaten his son, so the 'mysterious youth' hands his sword to the 
        evil ruler of galaxies to give him a sporting chance. Of course, the sword 
        made little difference, with Trunks catching it in between his fingers, 
        then blasting Cold in the chest, making blood spew from his mouth. Trunks 
        then finished him off by walking up to the evil one, and blasting him 
        right in the face.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>124. SSJ Trunks vs. SSJ Goku</p>
      <p>After Goku had arrived, Trunks took him to one side, and challenged him 
        to go Super Saiyan. Goku did so, and Trunks was impressed. He then grabbed 
        his sword, and swiped it right towards Goku's face. The Saiyan didn't 
        even move though, as Trunks stopped before he made contact. Goku explained 
        that he searched his feelings, and knew he wouldn't follow through. Trunks 
        threatens to really do it, so Goku charges up his index finger. Attacking 
        fiercely, Trunks uses his sword to try and hit Goku, but the SSJ is too 
        fast for him, blocking everything with his one finger. After a short while, 
        Trunks knows he can trust Goku, and that Goku is stronger than him, so 
        he powers down, and puts his sword away.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Android Saga</p>
      <p>125. Piccolo and Goku vs. Gohan</p>
      <p>This was during the preparation for the androids, where Goku and Piccolo 
        were training Gohan to become stronger, they double teamed on him a little, 
        slamming him down to the ground, with him impressing them by getting up, 
        and fighting once more.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>126. Piccolo vs. Goku</p>
      <p>Piccolo and Goku were sparring with each other, and both used their amazing 
        speed to get a short, yet sharp punch across the others cheek, causing 
        blood to trickle down slowly. This was only a short little session, as 
        they went at it a bit more before stopping. No real damage was done to 
        either man.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>127. #19 and #20 vs. Yajirobe</p>
      <p>When returning to Karin's Tower, Yajirobe's car was shot out of the sky 
        by the evil Androids, crashing down into the sea. Luckily he suffered 
        no harm, and was pulled out by Gohan. The Androids escaped too before 
        anyone else came.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>128. #19 and #20 vs. Humans</p>
      <p>The two Androids kill many people as they await the Earth's defenses, 
        slaughtering them for no reason. They also destroy a few vehicles with 
        their driver still in. This continues until they realize that Yamcha is 
        on his way, and they temporarily hide.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>129. #20 vs. Yamcha</p>
      <p>After scouting Yamcha, and finding out that they can draw a fair bit 
        of energy from him, the Androids confront him, with #20 wrapping his hand 
        round the human's throat, and sucking the energy from him, and slowly 
        killing him. He then finishes off the attack by plunging his fist right 
        through Yamcha's body.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>130. Goku vs. #20</p>
      <p>After seeing Dr. Gero destroy a whole city, Goku attacked him out of 
        anger, knocking his hat off as the punch recoiled through his head. Gero 
        picks up his hat and puts it back on, then Krillen takes the injured Yamcha 
        away to safety.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>131. Goku vs. #19</p>
      <p>Goku leads the Androids to a battlefield, and fights 19, winning until 
        the pain from his heart disease kicked in. He then fires a KameHameHa 
        which is absorbed by the Android, increasing his power, and allowing him 
        to beat Goku. Eventually the virus gets the better of him, and he is unable 
        to maintain his Super Saiyan form, collapsing on the floor, and leaving 
        himself vulnerable, and allowing #19 to capitalize and absorb Goku's energy.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>132. #20 vs. Piccolo</p>
      <p>After seeing Goku lose his energy, Piccolo goes over to help, but is 
        blocked by #20. He tries to get past by recklessly kicking him, but is 
        hit with an eye laser, and drops to the floor. This is later revealed 
        to be a mere distraction so Goku could be saved.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>133. Vegeta vs. #19</p>
      <p>Seeing Goku losing his energy, Vegeta burst onto the scene, and hit the 
        Android off him, then kicked Goku into Piccolo's hands, out of harms way. 
        He then turns super Saiyan, and easily defeats #19, until the diabolical 
        robot wraps his arms around Vegeta, absorbing his energy. Vegeta lets 
        him at first, then rips the arms of the artificial human, following it 
        up by killing it with a Big Bang attack.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>134. Vegeta vs. #20</p>
      <p>After killing one Android, Vegeta challenged the other, but it ran off, 
        scared of the Saiyan's confidence. Vegeta grabbed a sensu bean, healed 
        himself, and pursued the Android, eventually having to look for him due 
        to the coward hiding. Becoming impatient, Vegeta tried to blast him out, 
        but that is the opportunity that #20 was waiting for. He dived out into 
        the open, and absorbed Vegeta's energy beam.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>135. Piccolo and Gohan vs. #20</p>
      <p>#20 pounces behind Piccolo, and puts his hand over his mouth to absorb 
        energy. Piccolo psychically contacts Gohan to tell him he's in trouble, 
        and is saved by the boy, who pelts the Android to the ground. Everyone 
        else then arrives, as Vegeta prepares to fight #20.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>136. Piccolo vs. #20</p>
      <p>Piccolo takes a sensu, and fights #20 instead of Vegeta. He easily beats 
        the Android, surprising him with his powerful strength. This continues 
        until Trunks arrives, and provides enough of a distraction for #20 to 
        escape and go back into hiding for a while.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>137. Dr. Gero vs. Man</p>
      <p>On his way back to the lab, Android #20, now revealed as Dr. Gero, is 
        shot by a man who mistook him for a deer. Gero gives out a small KI blast, 
        and makes the man end up stuck up a tree and hurt badly, although not 
        enough to die.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>138. Dr. Gero vs. Krillen</p>
      <p>On his way back, the evil Android is spotted by Krillen, and the two 
        go at it. Of course Krillen gets the snot pummeled out of him, and is 
        left barely hanging onto his life as Gero flees back to his lab after 
        beating up the short warrior.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>139. #17 vs. Dr. Gero</p>
      <p>After being activated, #17 grows tired of his creators orders, and kicks 
        his head clean off, sending it rolling across the floor, and ending the 
        evil doctors dream of eternal life.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>140. Trunks vs. Androids</p>
      <p>Seeing that the Androids guard is down, Trunks shoots his most powerful 
        blast into Gero's lab. Unfortunately it doesn't effect them at all as 
        they dodge it easily, before flying off.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>141. Vegeta vs. Trunks</p>
      <p>As Vegeta attempted to pursue the Androids, Trunks blocked him telling 
        him not to go. Of course the Saiyan ignored him, and after a few warnings, 
        he punched Trunks in the stomach then continued to fly after the evil 
        artificial humans.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>142. Vegeta vs. #18 </p>
      <p>After it seemed even for a while, #18 showed Vegeta that she had been 
        toying with him the whole time, and effortlessly beat him up, breaking 
        his arm with one swift kick. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>143. #18 and #17 vs. Trunks</p>
      <p>After seeing his father hurt, Trunks flies in with his sword only to 
        have his swipe blocked by #18, then have #17 come behind him and slam 
        him to the ground.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>144. #17 vs. Tien and Piccolo</p>
      <p>After seeing Trunks get hurt, Tien and Piccolo fly in to help out, but 
        Piccolo is nailed straight to the floor by #17, and Tien is put in a chokehold. 
        The Namek later gets up and goes back after 17, but the Android releases 
        Tien, then nails Piccolo to the floor, leaving them both in a crippled 
        heap.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>145. #18 vs. Trunks and Vegeta</p>
      <p>This happened at about the same time as the previous fight, with #18 
        seeing Vegeta trying to help Tien, then grabbing him by the foot, and 
        throwing him into Trunks, taking Trunks out of commission, and hurting 
        Vegeta badly.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>146. #18 vs. Vegeta</p>
      <p>Vegeta attempts to get a quick KI blast in at 18 while she isn't focusing 
        on him, but she dodges it and knocks Vegeta down, and he doesn't get up 
        from this one until fed a sensu after the Androids have gone.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>147. Piccolo vs. Krillen, Trunks, and Tien</p>
      <p>Angry at having to resort to going to Kami for help, Piccolo throws a 
        KI blast at the ground by the trio, forcing them to evade it, worried 
        about how the Namek is reacting. Krillen assures them he's just annoyed 
        at having to fuse with Kami, and didn't intend any harm to come to them.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>148. Androids vs. Bikers</p>
      <p>The Androids are chased by bikers in their car, with #17 running down 
        a few of them before one smashes the window of his vehicle. He and 18 
        then get out and petrify the remaining bikers with a display of power. 
        They run off, then the police come and try to arrest them. All three of 
        the Androids break out of the cuffs, and 18 throws the police car into 
        a cliff, making it explode. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>149. #18 vs. Police</p>
      <p>After stealing some clothes from a nearby shop, #18 got back into the 
        van, and the three Androids sped into the distance. Inevitably annoyed 
        by the fact his stock was stolen, the shopkeeper rang the police who quickly 
        located the Androids. #18 became tired of the incessant wailing of the 
        police's sirens, and their constant threats to tell the far strength-superior 
        Androids to stop, so she sorted out the problem. 18 flew at the cars, 
        and destroyed them within seconds, completely wrecking the vehicles before 
        returning back to her van.</p>
