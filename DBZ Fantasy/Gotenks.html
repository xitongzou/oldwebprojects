Goku had taught them the fusion dance he learned while he was in the “other world”, the fusion only lasts for 30 minutes, and the people who want to fuse have to be near each other's power level, and have to do the fusion correctly, or else they'll end up looking mutated. Gotenks is a very immature fusion as he likes to make up attacks that are both stupid and powerful. He immediately goes super saiyan and even super saiyan 3 when he fuses. He appears for a brief time, when he fights fat buu inside the room of spirit and time, and and was defeating Fat Buu until the fusion wore out. Super Buu later absorbed Gotenks.<br>Attacks: super ghost kamikaze, galactica donut, renzoku shine, kiko-ha, galactica buu buu volleyball, super ki blast.<br>Power level at beginning of DBZ: N/A<br>Power level at end of DBZ: 410,000,000<br>Class: fusion<br></p></body></html>
