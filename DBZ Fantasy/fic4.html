Gohan was luaghing as he ran from Gokou. Gokou suddenly leapt up into the air and did a flip  landing in front of Goan. "Ahhhh!" Gohan fell back in suprise, Gokou smiled then picked up Gohan and tossed him in the small pond, then jumped in him self, and swam after Gohan.
<br>
A few minutes later Gokou and Gohanwalked back home. Chi Chi was setting plates on tables outside when they got home. "Whats are you doing?" Gokou asked looking at the table. "We're having that party remember?" Gokou's eyes widened, "Aparty! With food!" Chi Chi smiled as she set down the last plate,, "Yes there will be food, you two go get ready, everyone will be here soon." Gokou and Gohan went inside and got ready, changing into some new clothes, then ran back out. 
<br>
Everyone they knew was there, Kuririn, Trunks, Piccolo, even Gohan's little brother was there, sleeping in Chi Chi's arms. Vegeta walked up to Gokou a serious look on his face, "Whats this pasty for Gokou?" Gokou shrugged, "I have no idea, but I know there will be food!" Vegeta looked around with an unsure look on his face, "I dont have a very good feeling about being here," "What do you me-" Suddenly a bright streak of light shot by Gokou and hit a tree. "Hey!" Gokou looked over to see Chi Chi standing there with her hand out. "Chi Chi! What are you doing?!" Kuririn yelled out looking at Chi Chi. "Im not Chi Chi you fool! I am an android programed to destroy you all! Thats why I threw this party, to get you all together! And if you'd please call me by my code name Evil!" Gokou got in his fighting stance and angry look on his face, "Wheres the real Chi Chi!" Gokou yelled. "O-o-over here Gokou..." Gokou looked over and saw Chi Chi with a suprised look on her face still holding Goten.
<br>
Gokou looked at evil and smirked then leapt at it with his fists ready to punch at it. Evil quickly kicked up and hit Gokou in the gut, knocking him down. All the warriors attacked Evil and they all fell to the ground in pain, but they all got back up and attacked again. Vegeta got up and looked at Evil then yelled out, his fists glowing with ared light, Vegeta ran at Evil, and once he got close enough he released a fury of pucnhes towards Evil. Evil egan dodging and blocking, but Vegeta got one good hit in Evil's gut, knocking him down, Vegeta contnues his attack, punching at Evil's face. Evil grabbed Vegeta's hand and flung him across the feild. Evil got up, half its face ripped off revealing a shiny metal, and glowing red eyes.
<br>
Gohan looked at Evil and suddenly became filled wth anger. Gohan yelled out, his hair suddenly becoming blonde, and growing even longer, his eyes turning a light green, his muscles bulging, and a bright gold aura surrounding his body. Evil looked at Gohan a bit suprised, "Nice trick kid, are you going to challenge me as well?" Gohan did not reply to Evil, he simply, raised, his right hand, lowered his left hand at his waist, spread his feet apart and began concentrating. Then suddenly in the blink of an eye, Gohan threw out his left hand sending a huge wave of golf ki towards Evil with great speed.
<br>
Evil jumped up, but a second to late. The wave sliced through Evil's midsection, ripping it in half. The upper part of Evil luaghed, "No matter! I shall just self destruct!" The android luasghed then suddenly exploded, Gohan raised his hands and yelled out using his ki to make a wind and put out the fire from the explosion, the fire soon flickered out. Gohan lowered his arms and stood there, smirking, thinking about his victory.
