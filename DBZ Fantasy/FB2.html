<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial">Act 1: Ma Junior Comes to 
Attack on Son Goku</span></u><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
This act is basically, a &quot;warm-up.&quot; Goku and Piccolo exchange blows left and 
right, never really firing any ki at each other. After Piccolo has had enough of 
Goku's &quot;playing&quot; he decides to increases the odds a little. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial">Act 2: Piccolo Eats Kami 
and Son Goku Tricks Him</span></u><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
The real fight begins. Goku and Piccolo are hard at work trying to beat each 
other. Piccolo wouldn't care if he lost the tournament in exchange for Goku's 
life, but Goku wants to beat him, win the tournament, and then stop Piccolo from 
taking over the world. Just as it seems hopeless, Kami steps in, and, defends 
Goku, telling him, he will do the Mafuuba. After successfully doing it, Piccolo 
begins to go into the denshi jar, but Kami doesn't realize how strong Piccolo 
is, and, is counter-attacked to be put into the denshi jar. Piccolo then eats 
the jar, causing Kami to never come back. After a short fight, Piccolo decides 
to grow to an enormous size and force Goku out of the ring. Goku has an idea, 
and it works perfectly. He jumps up into Piccolo's mouth and gets back the 
denshi jar. Kami is saved. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial">Act 3: Piccolo Blasts the 
Arena and Goku Away</span></u><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
A very short act. This act just shows how strong Piccolo is, by destroying the 
ring and causing Goku to be hurt and scared a bit. After the ring is destroyed, 
Goku then decides to try and cripple Piccolo. He, instead, breaks off Piccolos 
arm, thinking he has got him armless. Piccolo then shows off his regeneration 
technique. Goku realizes that he cannot win by that then. This excites Goku a 
bit. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial">Act 4: Piccolo and Son Goku 
Fight Each Other to the Death </span></u>
<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
This act is very bloody. Piccolo legs and face show lots of blood, as Goku is 
firing him at all he has. But, Piccolo does just the same, and makes a big, 
gaping hole in Goku's chest. It just continues like that from there, causing 
them both extreme pains. </span></p>
<p><u><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial">Act 5: Son Goku 
Retaliates and Defeats Piccolo </span></u>
<span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
Piccolo gives it his all here, and, decides he doesn't care. He will decide to 
blow up everyone and everything around him, even if it kills him. After 
gathering the necessary ki, Piccolo then fires a blast so big, that Goku almost 
didn't make it. But, Goku even surprised himself and everyone else here. He 
learned how to fly. He flew straight up, without jumping or ki and hit Piccolo 
so hard; it made him fly back, out of the ring. Piccolo was stunned and so was 
Goku. After receiving a seznu, Goku was on his feet and feeling great. Goku had 
won his first Tenkaichi Budoukai fight. Piccolo, on the other hand, was 
crippled, paralyzed, and very sore. Goku felt sorry for him, and gave him a 
senzu. Piccolo told him he would regret it and flew off.</span>
