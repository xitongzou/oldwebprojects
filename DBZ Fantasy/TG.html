 Frieza can create from either the tip of his finger or with both
 hands. While small, it is very powerful, and can even destroy planets.
 In fact he used this attack to destroy both Planet Namek and Planet
 Vegeta (Goku’s home planet). He also attempts to destroy Planet
 Earth with this monstrous technique, but is soon to be prevented by
 Future Trunks.</td>

This is a technique used by
 Tien where he splits himself into four different entities. Each Tien
 entity created can fight and be attacked. The only problem with this
 move is that each of the four entities of Tien only has a quarter of
 the power and the speed than if there was only the one original Tien.
 Later in the series Piccolo and Cell learn how to use this move also.</td>

This is Future Trunks' trademark attack. After coming back
 from the future, during the battle with Frieza, he first introduces
 this awesome manoeuvre. He holds out both hands forward, index fingers
 and thumbs touching, and then unleashes a powerful energy blast. This
 is the attack that finally killed off Frieza for good.</td>

This is an attack which can prove very
 useful to the user. The attacker concentrates his or her energy, then
 lets loose with two compact beams, one from each eye. The strength of
 the beams is dependant on that of the user, but it tends to be
 powerful enough to finish off opponents of approximately the same
 strength. The first time we see anyone using this is when Piccolo does
 it whilst training Gohan. It doesn't cause any damage to him, but
 that's because Piccolo purposely made it weak. Frieza can also use
 this technique.</td>

 enemies. A very effective technique which wiped out virtually all of

 created by Master Roshi. It is a huge blast,which is charged up, and held behind the firer in cupped hands,
 then brought forward to release a large blast of energy. Goku later
 develops the ability to control the direction of the blast, shoot one
 from his feet, or with a single hand. He almost defeated Vegeta with
 this awesome attack, with the help of a little Kaioken. His son Gohan
 also learns to use this powerful move, as does Yamcha, Krillin, Tien,
 Goten, Cell, Cell Junior and Majin-Buu.</td>

 energy. However, the main weakness that this attack possesses is that
 it takes a lot of time to gather the energy for a Genki Dama. Whilst
 he sticks his arms up in the air, preparing to receive all of this
 energy, Goku is defenseless and open to attack.</td>

 possessed this incredible technique, and has the skill to control the
 destination of the attack as well. He would have killed the almighty
 Nappa, during the battle with the Saiyans on Earth, if it weren’t
 for Vegeta warning Nappa at the last moment not to touch it. Krillin
 also uses this attack to slice off Frieza’s tail during the battle
 on Namek. Many other DBZ characters like Vegeta, Frieza, Cell and
 Android 18 have their own variations of the Destructo Disk.</font></td>

 power to his Kaioken. At first, he shouldn't have been able to go past
 2 x Kaioken without seriously endangering himself, as warned by King
 Kai, but eventually can increase the power of the Kaioken to around a
 20 x Kaioken.</font></p>
