            <p>Of course, there is always a catch. You have to go by some rules 
              and regulations to make this a fair fight. You are disqualified 
              if you have a weapon or use any kind of object to help you win. 
              If you leave the tournament and if you kill your opponent, you lose. 
              You have lost when you have been knocked unconscious, or, go down 
              from the count of 10. Also, you have lost when, you get knocked 
              out of the ring or say, &quot;I give up/Mercy&quot; Oh, and uh, 
              you can't do this: poke your opponent in the eyes, or, hit anyone 
              in the family jewels. When - The 21st through the 23rd Tenkaichi 
              Budoukais take place in the Dragon Ball saga. The 24th through the 
              28th Tenkaichi Budoukai take place in Dragon Ball Z. They are held 
              on May 7 every three years. </p>
