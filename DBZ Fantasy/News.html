<tr><td>Well, despite my last update, i have good news and bad news. The good news is that i have a new anime site at <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/oz/japanime">http://www.angelfire.com/oz/japanime</a>. The bad news is that i won't be updating this site anymore :(. Rest assured though, my HTML career is not over, and my new site is on Japanese Anime, including DBZ! It even has the same familiar layout as this site! So you might want to check it out! I also won't be updating this site anymore, as you know. BTW, my name on my new site is Gofishus, not tongzouca2, sounds cooler no?</td>

<tr><td>I have come with some grave news :(. I will not be updating the site anytime soon anymore because of lack of time. I have found that either i am too busy doing other things or am enjoying myself too much outside (I do have a life outside the computer you know). You may also have noticed that my interest in DBZ have diminished. While i will always have a spot for DBZ in my heart,I still constantly seek new interets and experiences. Now that the DBZ Series is over, I feel that my interest should belong somewhere else (Sorry guys, DBGT just doesn't cut it). I will leave one last parting gift; a DBZ flash game. I don't take credit for it, but i thought you guys might like this so <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/d20/crono/dbz.swf">Here it is</a>. My flash programming will continue, and i may update again someday, who knows? Until then, this is tongzouca2 signing off for the (hopefully not) last time.</td>

<tr><td>I now have March Break to cope with my busy schedule so hopefully updates will be coming soon :). My Soul Calibur flash game is also coming along very well, you can view it at its current state <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/d20/crono/SC.swf">Here</a>. its still uncompleted and right now i just have the menu but i need feedback.

More importantly, they have the <a href="http://www.zstore.com/Detail.bok?no=1328">DBZ GBC Game</a> available to pre-order which is becoming available in November and is at the price of $30.00. Game goes through the Cell and Buu sagas apparently and looks more promising than Legacy of Goku. <a href="http://www.dragonballtoys.com">Dragon  Ball Toys</a> also has the new line of Striking Z Fighters up as well.<br><br>If you watch FOX (which we all know you do because of their blockbuster programming which really shows what a station can accomplish), you may be familiar with their TV show "30 Seconds to Fame" (most likely airs between something like "When Babies go Wrong IV" and "Hidden Cameras in an Unusual Area"). The point of me mentioing this show is that Mike McFarland's comedy troupe (Section 8 Comedy which also has Josh Martin and Chris Rager as members) will most likely be performing on the show, so keep you eyes open for them.<br><br>Lastly, Sam from <a href="http://www.saiyanz-rage.net">SzR</a> has sent me info that in the next Shonen Jump Newsletter a 6-page interview with Akira Toriyama will occur where we will get some light shed on us regarding some various topics...such as a new Dragon Ball manga.<br><br>That's the news, and I am Tongzouca2.</td>

<tr><td>Nice week off, since I got lots of homework and lots of tests overwith. But now, I'm back and with a slight bit of news. In an ad in Japan, there was a talk of Dragon Ball coming back. Back to be re-printed that is. You all know of how Dragon Ball was supposed to be re-printed, along with some other great manga's, and will start soon. So, if you hear any speculation on that Dragon Ball is coming back, it is ONLY BEING RE-PRINTED. I speak for all the staff members here when I say, I DO NOT WANT E-MAILS ASKING IF THERE IS NEW DRAGON BALL, because the fact is, it is only being re-printed! After saying that about three to four times, you should get it now. Cyas.</td>

<tr><td>I made a new banner!(yay!) email me if you like it! Anyways...
Sam from <a href="http://www.saiyanz-rage.net">SzR</a> sent this in:<br><br><i>I have contacted Toonami/Cartoon Network Reps. about DBGT and new DBZ episodes.  This is what they had to say.<br><br>"Hi Sam, <br>I think that there might have been a misunderstanding.  Dragonball GT will not be airing on Cartoon Network in September 2002.  However,  the new Dragon Ball Z episodes will begin September 16, 2002."<br><br>So DBGT is definetly not airing on Cartoon Network this year. That is the official word from Cartoon Network. And Season 6 of DBZ, New episodes will start September 16, 2002.</i><br><br>I think this should put all rumors of GT in 2002 to rest, and I assume this means they will come out in September 2003 like I have been hearing for over a year.</td>

<tr><td>DBZ Legacy of Goku news:<br><br>
Thanks to you DBZ fans, video game sales results for May 2002 showed that Dragon Ball Z® Legacy of Goku was far and away the #1 title for Game Boy® Advance (GBA) during the period, according to NPDFunworld TRSTS Video Games Services. Not only was Dragon Ball Z® Legacy of Goku #1 but it crushed the nearest competitors. The explosive performance of Dragon Ball Z® Legacy of Goku also catapulted the game to the #2 slot among the Top 100 Selling Video Games for May 2002, and the #28 slot for the year to date, according to NPDFunworld. When combined with the strong sales of Infogrames’ Dragon Ball Z®: Collectible Card Game, which debuted in late May, the Dragon Ball Z® franchise earned Infogrames the #1 rank among all GBA publishers for May 2002.</i><br><br>Now I don't really have that good of an opinion on this game, but I guess it is good news that the DBZ game is the top seller.
