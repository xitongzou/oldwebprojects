  - Attack! 10,000,000,000 Power Warriors!</font></h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">This film begins where the last one left
  off. It is the aftermath of the Kula battle, Goku lies on the floor, completely fatigued,
  and unable to move. Gohan and Krillen comfort him, and Piccolo seems to have disappeared
  after suffering heavy injuries after his colossal battle. Some rubble begins to move,
  making Gohan walk over to it, hoping that it is Piccolo. From out of the debris emerges
  Kula&#146;s most powerful henchman though, laughing manically, and ready to kill them all.
  Suddenly, a beam bursts through his chest, killing him instantly, and saving everyone.
  Whilst he isn&#146;t there, everyone knows that it was Piccolo who rescued them.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">On New Namek, a mysterious craft lands, and
  starts to drain the planet of the energy. The peaceful Nameks are forced to queue up to
  have all of their energy taken from them, which would result in their deaths. Hearing the
  call of his people, Dende, the Earths guardian, calls upon the Z soldiers to travel over
  to the planet, and rescue the friendly green men. Goku, Gohan, Piccolo, Krillen, Yajirobe,
  Roshi, and Oolong<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>travel in the ship, on
  their way to save the gracious species.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">The Z soldiers arrive, and briefly battle
  some powerful robots, before their leader, Kula comes. He looks different to last time
  though, cased in some sort of metal, a cyborg so to speak. Goku has a short flashback,
  where he remembers how he blasted Kula into the sun, then looks at him in disbelief, not
  understanding how anyone could survive something as devastating as that. Kula decides to
  ease Goku&#146;s wondrous confusion, and tells him that a metagalactic starship found him,
  then rescued him, feeding off his energy, and eventually creating him in his cyborg
  physical form. He says that as he drains peoples energy, he becomes far more powerful than
  anyone could ever imagine.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Goku and Kula go off to battle once more,
  settling an old score, leaving Piccolo, Gohan, Krillen, and Roshi to battle some of the
  huge, bulky robots in a comical battle, where the warriors hurt their limbs whenever they
  attack the rigid robots. It finishes when Piccolo discovers their weak points, and begins
  destroying them, with Gohan joining in. Even Krillen did a fair bit of damage!</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Kula and Goku battle fiercely, with Goku
  being the eventual loser. He powers up to Super Saiyan form, in the hope of evening up the
  odds a little, but to no avail. Every time Goku got the advantage, or damages Kula, he
  regenerated the weak parts, and announced that he can&#146;t be beaten, as he can
  reconstruct himself.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">It looks as though Kula is about to finish
  Goku, when an unlikely savour comes, in the form of Vegeta. He knocks Kula down, then
  immediately powers up to Super Saiyan. Goku and Vegeta fight Kula simultaneously, but are
  easily defeated, unable to do an awful lot to their opponent. They realize that they
  aren&#146;t going to beat him like this, so they decide to double team, and work together.
  They put all they have into it, and barely manage to defeat the monster, despite being
  paralysed with pain afterwards. It seems as though all is fine, until a huge group of
  Kula&#146;s appear on top of a small ridge. Goku and Vegeta are terrified, but stand up
  none-the-less, and give out their most powerful blast. They then fade into
  unconsciousness.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">When the two Super Saiyans regain
  consciousness, they are strapped to a wall, with wires attached to them. Kula is there,
  taunting them, and draining their energy. They scream out in pain, but realize how to
  defeat this flow of raw, intensive power. They charge up, making even more energy flow
  through the wires, and the control mainframe overload and malfunction. It blows up,
  destroying much of the metagalactic starship, where the Super Saiyans are being held
  hostage. They manage to drop down from the wires, incredible badly hurt. Neither Saiyan is
  able to do much, but Goku struggles, then puts all his power into getting up, and charges
  up an energy ball to destroy Kula once and for all. He fails in the attempt though, as
  Kula takes all of the remaining power from the starship. Many explosions happen, and all
  the cyborg Kula&#146;s explode. The real Kula is only a quaint portion of facial skin,
  with many wires and parts attached. Kula crushes Goku, but before he can finish him off,
  Vegeta shoots a blast at the evil ones arms, cutting them off, making him release Goku.
  Quickly using the opportunity, Goku charges up a small spirit bomb, and throws it right
  into Kula&#146;s stomach, making him explode almost instantly.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Goku and Vegeta are blasted off the ship,
  due to the power of the explosion, and soar downwards, all their energy completely spent.
  They both crash to the ground, hurt fairly badly. Goku is given a sensu bean, and quickly
  recovers back to his feet, but Vegeta seems to have disappeared.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">A small Saiyan pod swiftly flies out of the
  atmosphere, and inside sits a battered and bloody Vegeta, with a microchip in his hands,
  containing all the information for Kula and the metagalactic starship. He crushes it in
  one hand, and says bye in an evil way to the Kula reminiscent.<span
