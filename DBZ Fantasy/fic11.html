<H1><A NAME="Hell">I. HELL</A></H1>
<p>
On the burning plain, a demon paused, sniffing the air. It was a
small, wiry demon, barely man-high, with the appearance of a horribly
emaciated grey man with huge, round eyes, crooked pointy teeth, and
elongated fingers tipped with monstrous claws.  Its head swung from
side to side, listening, smelling, waiting.
<p>
SWA-KOOM! A rock exploded in a flash of energy! The demon leaped
toward the source of the blast, razor-sharp claws extended, chittering
eagerly at the sweet taste of soul force.
<p>
Its target side-stepped the demon's charge, and a keen blade lashed
out.  The demon collapsed as it landed, its feet cut out from under
it. It wailed, and futilely tried to ward off the bright blade with
its claws.  The head rolled, still wailing and gnashing its teeth,
until the point of the blade pinned it to the burning plain.
<p>
"Got you! I thought you were never going to come out of hiding, but
you just couldn't resist the taste of raw ki, could you?" The demon's
would-be victim smirked.  He might have been human, except for the
long furred tail wrapped around his waist and the immense mane of
stiff black hair that flowed down his back to below his knees.
<p>
"Feh. A sword, Raditz? I didn't think you'd fallen that far!" came a
contemptuous, familiar voice from behind.
<p>
The tall, powerfully-built warrior answered without even looking
behind himself, "The mara is an energy vampire, Vegeta. It feeds on
soul force.  My blade is as steel; it has neither passion nor energy;
it's just sharp." He smirked. "I'd be happy to let you fight it, but
then I'd have to clean up the mess."  He finally turned, carefully
keeping the writhing demon's head pinned with the blade, to look at
his former partner and prince.
<p>
"Hmmph! So don't blast it, just hit it." The saiyan prince aimed a
vicious kick at the demon's head; Raditz blocked it. "You dare?"
<p>
"The mara drains soul force by touch--yours or its. You really don't
want to finish that kick!" Raditz grinned unpleasantly. "He's weak
now--I haven't let him feed for days--but you should see him all
charged up.  Heh. The maras hang around the borderland, looking for
mortals whose spirits are wandering in dreams--then they harry them
all night, sucking ki out of their souls and giving them nightmares in
return.  Good for me Earth mortals are so weak; maras can't do much
more than look really ugly from what they steal.  Too bad for Earth
mortals they are so weak--they die or go mad from the life theft if it
keeps up."
<p>
Vegeta laughed; a cold, malicious sound. "So blasting the little
bastard would make him stronger, would it?  And he'd steal my strength
if I fought him hand-to-hand? That would be a tricky fight.. an
interesting fight! Are there other demons like him?"
<p>
"There are.  Why do you think the Saiyajin Demon Guard--my outfit--all
carry swords?" He took out a small black stone, and stopped, looking
quizzically at Vegeta.  "When did you get here?  Did you die recently,
Vegeta, or am I clueless as usual?"
<p>
"Not much more than a week ago." The short, dark-haired saiyan
frowned, and spent some time straightening out his white
gloves. "There is a problem--I've already been wished back once with
Earth's dragonballs, and no one knows where Namek's dragonballs or the
Nameks are.  They can't wish me back."
<p>
"I could have been wished back with the dragonballs--funny how that
never happened. Sympathy isn't one of my virtues, Vegeta." He
abruptly clapped the black stone to the demon's head, and watched
coldly as the demon's head and body dissolved into mist and seeped
into the stone.
<p>
"I was better off without you," the prince of the saiyajin said
coldly, as he turned and walked away.
<p>
Raditz sighed and straightened, demon-stone in hand. "Wait, Vegeta."
<p>
"Why?"
<p>
"I shouldn't have said that. I dug my own grave, and I didn't leave
many friends behind. I've no right to complain.."
<p>
"Did you leave any friends at all behind?"
<p>
"One." Raditz smiled to himself.
<p>
"Not me!"
<p>
"Vegeta, you were my prince and I was loyal to you unto death, but you
were always 'the strong man who stands alone, above all'. Remember?"
<p>
"Yes, I know. Who--"
<p>
"Nappa. He was a good friend, mentor, and teacher--and he would have
wished me back if he'd had the chance. He told me that much." Raditz
spoke quietly. "I would have wished him back."
<p>
"Nappa should not have lost to a mere third-class warrior like
Kakarott." Vegeta closed his eyes, and half-turned away, the regret in
his face belying his callous words.
<p>
Raditz looked at Vegeta, astonished. He opened his mouth as if to say
something, then thought better of it. You have changed, my prince. You
have changed.
<p>
"I don't have friends here," Vegeta said. "Though my father is.. my
ally in this.  There's only you, or Nappa, and Nappa--"
<p>
"--is still a bit peeved at you for killing him." Raditz regarded his
fallen prince thoughtfully. "When did you ever have any use for
friends?"
<p>
Vegeta smirked. "I never had a use for them, but they're a nuisance
I've acquired along with my wife and son. However, they're all alive
and not here. By the way, how is Nappa otherwise?"
<p>
Raditz just stood there. "Wife.. and.. son?" He blinked. "Wife and
son? You have a wife and son?"
<p>
"It does happen--we choose a mate, we have children.. I have heard
that such a thing might have happened with our fathers," Vegeta's
sarcasm was sharp enough to cut.  "Now if you're paying attention.."
<p>
"Oh, you've got my attention. I'm curious as to what amazing thing I'm
going to hear next."
<p>
"My wife, Bulma--an old friend of Kakarott's--is alone and
unprotected without me.  They can't wish me back. I will find a way
back myself."
<p>
"That's impossible! You can only go back as a ghost, and only if the
way is opened for you..."
<p>
"I could--and I have, briefly--but I mean to go back as myself, not a
powerless ghost. I have learned that it has been done before, and if
some mere human can do it, so can I!" Vegeta's eyes were wide with
excitement and determination.
<p>
"But how? As far as I know--"
<p>
"There are other hells, deeper hells than this. Other pasts, other
peoples now forgotten went to them.  There are legends of humans and
others escaping, or winning their way back to life from those hells."
<p>
Raditz closed his eyes. "Of course. The mythic hells." He opened his
eyes again. "You would. You can't resist a challenge like that! You
know the way is guarded, don't you?"
<p>
"Of course. I have my father's 'kind permission' to make the attempt;
I also have your father's permission for one other thing."  King
Vegeta, Duke of the Hell of Evil Warriors, had not been overly
enthusiastic about his son's proposed quest, but had grudgingly
acceded.  The occasionallly prescient Commander Bardock, Lord-General
of the Legions of Hell, had been enigmatic but cooperative.
<p>
"What?"
<p>
"I don't know how long I'll be gone on this.. quest, but I won't be
able to watch over her and protect her while I'm gone. I want you to
do that."
<p>
"WHAT????"

<p>
"Bulma, why don't you just pack Trunks and yourself up and come stay
with us for a month or two?" Chi-chi offered, her dark eyes full of
concern. "Please. I have some idea what you're going through, and you
need friends now. Come home with me--it'll be so much better with me
and Gohan and little Goten and Dad and Goku, instead of rattling
around this big empty place alone. I can help you with Trunks,
too--he'll have fun playing with Goten."
<p>
"That would be nice," Bulma said sadly. She looked up from the picture
she clutched in her hands, eyes red from crying. "But.. this is where
we were together, and--" the tears started running down her face
again. "--everything here reminds me of HIM--" she started sobbing
openly, "--and it'd be like leaving him!"
<p>
"Oh, Bulma!" Chi-chi hugged and held her grieving friend. She hugged
Bulma tight until the sobs subsided, and gently turned her to look
her in the eye.  "Bulma, he's not here. You know that in your head,
but your heart doesn't want to listen. I didn't want to, when my sweet
Goku was gone, and little Gohan was kidnapped, but I had to. You have
to, for your sake, and for little Trunk's sake." Chi-chi stood up, and
looked down Bulma. "And maybe for his sake, too."
<p>
"His sake?" Bulma looked forlornly at Chi-chi.
<p>
"You think he doesn't know how you feel about him? Wherever he is, he
knows how you miss him, and he misses you just as much. But Vegeta's not
here. Not now.  And you aren't doing him, you or Trunks any good
burying yourself in solitude and tearing yourself up like this."
Chi-chi put her hands on her hips. "Girl, have you looked at yourself
in mirror lately?  I'm not sure you've been eating, and you sure
haven't been sleeping! At least if you come home with me, I'll make
sure you eat." Chi-chi made it sound more like a threat than an offer.
<p>
"I haven't been sleeping, much." Bulma said tiredly. "And when I do,
the nightmares.." She shuddered. She stood up, her decision
made. "We're coming with you."
<p>
Nightmares? Raditz did not like the sound of that. He seated himself
comfortably in mid-air, immaterial and invisible, a ghost. He did not
like the hollowness under Bulma's eyes, or the way her clothes hung
loosely on her. Grief, or something worse, was consuming her--and that
worried Raditz. So did the fact that it had been three weeks, not one,
since Vegeta had joined him in Hell.
<p>
Raditz had come close to complete panic when he first realized the
enormity of the responsibility Vegeta had laid on him, when he first
beheld the tantalizingly familiar blue-haired girl that
Vegeta.. loved.  There was no other word for it--her grief was too
deep and genuine for her not to be loved; it cut Raditz like a knife
and it wasn't even directed at him. That odd hesitancy while Vegeta
explained his dilemma to Raditz, and his unshakeable determination to
get back to her no matter what; it all added up: Vegeta, Prince of the
Saiyajin, loved this woman heart and soul--and his pride would not let
him admit it to anyone.
<p>
Why did you lay this on me, Vegeta? It is too great a responsibility
for me! You must have been completely desperate! Of course you were
desperate--there was no one else you could even remotely trust, not in
that realm.  And yet.. I agreed. I promised you I would watch over
her, and protect her in spirit, until you returned. Which of us was
the greater fool?
<p>
I know her, my prince.  She stood with Kakarott, bold and beautiful,
when I first came to Earth, so many years ago. She had the nerve to
look me in the eye and tell me how vile I was--rulers of entire worlds
had less courage than she did.  And.. she has the courage to love you,
Vegeta. Was there ever anyone of our race so brave?

<p>
"Trunks can sleep with Goten, and I had Gohan put your stuff here in the
guest room." Chi-chi showed Bulma around the house. "Don't worry if
you hear something like an elephant tromping around the house at
night, that's just Daddy--his room is across the hall from you."
<p>
Bulma looked around, a tentative smile on her face for the first time
in days. "Thank you very much, Chi-chi. You are so kind to me, and you
and Goku have such a wonderful, cozy house up here in the woods. I
don't want to be any trouble, though..."
<p>
"No trouble at all. Gohan was way too big to share a room with Goten,
so we attached a new addition onto the house. It's fun to have friends
over, and now we actually have room for everyone. Go ahead and make
yourself at home, dinner is in one hour." Chi-chi breezed out, leaving
Bulma alone to unpack.
<p>
She almost felt cheerful for a while, until she came to the
picture. It was her favorite picture of Vegeta--he was wearing that
devilish smirk of his and that silly pink shirt she'd given him. She
set it gently on the nightstand beside her bed, tears running down her
face.
<p>
Later, after dinner, she sat with Chi-chi, Goku, Gohan and Ox King to
watch the sunset. (The babies were already in bed).  Goku, she
thought, was looking pretty good in spite of everything they had been
through. It never ceased to amaze her how equally at home Goku was
here, in his peaceful forest home with his wife and sons, or in the
middle of the most savage mayhem imaginable. He loved to fight, and
yet he was just as content to live peacefully with his family.  Not
like Vegeta, who was always restless without an enemy to
fight. Vegeta.. she wiped two hot tears from her eyes, and gritted her
teeth. No! I will not start bawling like a baby in front of Goku and
everybody!
<p>
She looked at Gohan, who was looking back at her sympathetically. He'd
grown; he was twelve now, and starting to sprout up. Chi-chi still
kept him hard at his studies; he'd barely finished his homework in
time to join them at sunset.
<p>
"How's the report going, kid?" Bulma said affectionately.
<p>
Gohan sighed.  "Just finished the rough draft. It's not due until next
week, so mom's letting me wait until tomorrow to clean it up."
<p>
"What's it about? The books looked interesting."
<p>
"It's my semester report for Literature, and I'm doing it on Japanese
Folklore. There's some really neat stories in there--reading them was
the fun part--but writing the report is a lot of work.  It almost
takes the fun out of the reading," Gohan sighed again.
<p>
"Kid, take it from Bulma, don't ever let the bad parts make you forget
how good the good parts are." You know, I should listen to myself
sometimes, Bulma realized.
<p>
Chi-chi smiled; Gohan was good company for Bulma. He cheered her
up already. She still wasn't eating as much as Chi-chi would have
liked, but maybe after a good night's sleep and a day in the fresh
air...
<p>
Ox King kept his thoughts to himself, and got up as soon as the sun
dipped below the horizon. "I think I'll take a stroll around the house
before turning in," is all he said as he strode off into the gathering
gloom. The others chatted and joked a while before gradually drifting
inside.
<p>
Ox King looked around in the twilight. He must be somewhere around
here.. Yes! There he was! Ox King could see the visitor now, for it
was twilight, the time when ghosts and spirits became visible to those
who knew to look.  The stranger spirit seemed to be a big, tall man
with a great shaggy mane of hair, dressed in strange, battered armor.
He wore a long katana slung across his back, the hilt just peeking out
from under his hair.
<p>
The ghost stood watching the others, and did not heed Ox King's
approach, which did not surprise Ox King. The ghost was not a local
spirit, and probably didn't know that Ox King could see both
worlds--typical for a retired General of the Animal Kingdom, but not
at all common for most people.  Ox King feigned ignorance as he moved
closer.
<p>
Standing very close to the ghost, almost next to him, Ox King watched
the spirit out of the corner of his eye.  A powerful ghost, he
sensed, but not hostile. Why was he here? Ox King stepped and turned
to face him.
<p>
The ghost started, and stared at him wide-eyed, realizing with obvious
dismay that Ox King saw him. Ox King noted his fine, almost handsome
features, peaked hair, and.. tail! Then twilight deepened into night,
and the ghost was gone.
<p>
"Hmmmm. A Saiyan warrior. Who are you, I wonder? You're not Vegeta,
but you're here visiting with Bulma. Does she know you?  Should I ask
her?" Ox King addressed the night.
<p>
No, whispered a cold wind. Do not tell her! She would be afraid, and I
mean her no harm. Rather the opposite--and the wind tasted of irony.
<p>
Ox King's eyes narrowed, and he asked slowly, thoughtfully, "Are you
one of Goku's friends?"
<p>
The wind was still.  At last, a wistful sigh--I'd like to be. I wish I
had been...
<p>
"That's all right, then." Ox King continued his stroll.

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Bulma regarded the soft bed with trepidation. Goku and his family went
to bed earlier than she was used to, but she was so tired. It would
feel so good to lie down and sleep--but then what nightmares might
come? Nightmares so bad that she was afraid to sleep
anymore. But.. things were different here, in Goku's house. Weren't
they?
<p>
At last, she lay down and fell asleep almost immediately.  Then she
began to dream.

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Eeeee! Chi-chi's father can see me! He senses spirits, like my brother
senses living powers, and like I can sense other spirits. What is he?
He's not human, I can sense that much--and he's Gohan and Goten's
grandfather, so.. Chi-chi seems to be part human--more human than her
father, at least. That makes my nephews half-saiyan, part-human, and
part-what?  Whatever Gohan is, it makes him stronger than any child
I've ever seen.  I can feel his power even from here, in the
borderland.  And for a two-year-old, Goten's power is, ah, impressive.
<p>
What's that?  Spirits, and I don't like their feel. And one
other.. familiar. Raditz almost unconsciously raised a hand to his
face, to tune a scouter that was not there...
<p>
He found her wandering the bewildering mists of the borderland, that
shadowy realm where the otherworld and the world of the living
touch. The realm that the living sometimes walk in dreams; she was
walking there.
<p>
Bulma walked open-eyed but unseeing, calling for the one she had
lost. "Vegeta! Where are you?  Please, come back! Vegeta, answer me! I
can't find you!"
<p>
Oh, great! She's gone looking for him! If she keeps this up, she might
find him--and not come back. Or something might find her.
<p>
Then he saw the other spirits following her. Maras. Of course; now he
knew the source of her nightmares.  Raditz grinned wickedly as he
unsheathed the ghost katana at his back...

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
The morning sun woke Bulma.  She yawned and stretched; goodness, it
was broad daylight! She'd slept the whole night through! It felt so
good--the first full night's sleep she'd had since.. since Vegeta
died. She glanced at his picture beside the bed, and let the tears
flow freely; they were good tears, tears for the one she loved and
missed so much, not the tears of broken despair she'd been weeping for
the last two weeks.
<p>
"One way or another, we'll be together again," she promised. "There
are other legendary wishes besides the dragonballs; if their legend
was real, maybe some of the others are, too.  I've only got an
entire lifetime to find one, and if I fail, well, I still win, because
you'll be there waiting for me." She thought of something, and added,
"Don't worry, I won't do anything stupid--Trunks needs his mother
alive and well."
<p>
A bit later, she joined Gohan for a late breakfast (it was not a
school day, and he had also slept in) after making sure Trunks held
still long enough to eat something that wasn't moving (What was it
with little saiyan boys and bugs? Chi-chi said Gohan and Goten had
been the same way, and Bulma remembered young Goku's propensity for
eating anything that held still long enough--wolves, pterodactyls,
airplanes..)
<p>
As soon as his mother let him go, Trunks all but dragged
little Goten out the door, anxious to explore all the neat places he'd
seen out the window. "And don't eat anything unless Chi-chi or I say
it's food!" she yelled out the door after him, knowing she was wasting
her breath.
<p>
What a night! She'd slept well, but her dreams had been
bizarre. First, it seemed like the same old nightmares; she was
wandering about in the fog, looking for Vegeta, calling and calling
him, then the monsters started to appear. The monsters that looked
like twisted copies of Vegeta, and the thing that killed him, and that
horrible frog--and then the samurai had appeared. With incredible
grace and speed, the warrior had sliced all the monsters to
pieces. Then the samurai had turned to her, and said, "Go back. You're
not safe here, and you won't find Vegeta here. The monsters tricked
you into coming here so they could get you. Don't come back here
alone." In the dream, she'd taken the samurai's advice and gone
back--to where, she wasn't sure, but she'd slept well. The really
bizarre thing, though, was that the samurai had looked exactly like
Goku's evil brother Raditz.
<p>
Raditz had been dead and forgotten for the better part of a decade.

<p>
"Whew! Bulma, we've got a huge list of wish legends here. Even after
weeding out the purely fictional ones, there's.." Gohan squinted at
the screen, "7386 at last count. Now what?"
<p>
"Now we use those enhanced filters I designed. First, we dump all the
ones that are too vague to be correlated with anything in the real
world--no identifiers as to name, species, place, distinctive
landmarks, and so on--for example, take this one from China: how on
earth would we find one magic talking carp in all the rivers and lakes
of China?  There's nothing in the legend to pin it down to a
particular river, lake, district, mountain range or whatever. So, we
dump it."
<p>
"What about cross-correlation with variations?" Gohan worried they
might miss something.
<p>
"Already done. Related legends are merged if they have enough
parallels without mutually exclusive conditions--for example, our carp
has some correlation with other talking fish stories--but they
originate from Europe and Japan. Sure, maybe the same story has
travelled a bit, and all the stories are variations the same true
one--but how do we know where it came from, and what bits are from the
'original' story, and what bits are added local flavor?  We don't, so
it goes in the 'last-chance' stack."
<p>
Bulma entered the command to start her filter programs running, and
stood up.  "Gohan, let's take a break and see what kind of trouble the
kids are getting into.  I don't know about you, but my eyeballs are
ready to fall out." She rubbed her eyes.
<p>
Two weeks ago, Gohan had generously offered to help Bulma with her
search for a wish. As time allowed, after his homework was done, he
and Bulma plundered the world's electronic libraries of folklore
literature and anthropology reports.  Chi-chi wouldn't let Gohan stay
up past his normal bedtime, but deftly turned aside Goku's attempts to
'get his son outside more'; this project of Bulma's was good
preparation for Gohan in learning how to do serious, college-level
research. He was learning a lot from Bulma, Chi-chi could see that.
<p>
Goten was roughhousing with his grandpa on the floor, holding his
fingers against his head pretending they were horns and butting Ox
King in stomach, all the while yelling "Noxking! Noxking!" at the top
of his lungs.  Ox King would laugh and toss Goten up to where the
toddler could grab his horns and swing from them, giggling. Bulma
smiled; that youngster was a real handful and Chi-chi was going to
need all the help she could get from Ox King, Goku and Gohan. He was
so different from the quiet, shy lad that Gohan had been when she
first met him, or that Trunks was--if anything, Goten was a lot like
young Goku must have been, before Bulma met him.
<p>
Bulma checked on Trunks; he and Goku were just finishing up his
training session.  "Bath first, then snacks," she admonished him as he
darted for the kitchen.  She smiled at Goku. "Thanks for everything."
<p>
He blushed. "It's no big deal; I'd have done it anyway. He needs to
keep up his training--we found out the hard way that not training
Gohan was a mistake, and.." he trailed off, finding it hard to say the
words he knew would bring the tears back to Bulma's eyes.
<p>
"..and his father isn't here to train him." She smiled wryly through
the tears blurring her eyes. "He'd probably throw a fit if he knew
'Kakarott' was training HIS royal son, but I think he'd rather have
you train Trunks than anyone else.  I know I do."

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Come the weekend, Goku finally prevailed on Chi-chi to get Gohan off
the computer and out of the house--he and Gohan would take the kids
fishing. Bulma assured Gohan that tweaking the archaeology search
engine program was a one-woman job, and that he wouldn't miss
anything.  Chi-chi insisted on packing picnic lunches for everyone,
because "What happens if you get hungry before you catch a fish big
enough to eat?"  Trunks demanded a backpack and lunch of his own,
because "I'm not baby like Goten any more!". Chi-chi suspected that
Trunks worried that Goku might eat his lunch and Trunks' lunch, too,
if it was all in the same hamper.  Goten didn't voice any opinions, he
just ran around the kitchen leaping and diving to the floor, yelling
"Splash!" every time he dove and rolled.
<p>
"No, Trunks, not sushi!" Chi-chi took the sushi pack from his backpack
and put it back in the refrigerator. "You don't have a backpack
cooler, and sushi isn't good after three hours in the sun. Trust
me. Take the stuffed dumplings instead, and some fruit." Chi-chi
insisted on supervising the boys' lunches ever since the day Bulma
caught Trunks and Goten catching crawfish in the creek out back--and
eating them.
<p>
"But Mom! Crawfish really are food! The Americans eat them; Gohan
showed me in his Geography book."
<p>
"They wash them and cook them, first!" Bulma had retorted. "And don't
tell me you were having crawfish sushi, either.  For that, you bring
them to the kitchen, and have Chi-chi supervise you cleaning and
peeling them.  We do not eat them shell and all with the mud still on
them!"

<p>
Goten liked the rocks. The river bed was full of big, round rocks that
were just perfect for a little boy to laboriously climb to the top of,
and stand at the summit in triumph.  "Daddy! Look a' me!" he
yelled. Sometimes, for variety, he called Trunks or Gohan, but they
were always busy staring at the water and playing with those
poles. After twenty rocks or so, even Daddy didn't seem interested in
his game. After thirty rocks, Goten himself was bored and wandered off
into the woods looking for something interesting.
<p>
Raditz was almost as bored as Goten. Watching Bulma and Gohan play
with the computer for the last few weeks had been as exciting as
watching paint dry. No more maras had shown up, Bulma had quit
wandering off into the spirit plane in her dreams, and with Kakarott
and Gohan around, Bulma was quite safe from any mundane threats. He
felt quite unnecessary, but he had promised Vegeta.. and he wasn't
going to break a promise again. Not ever.
<p>
Oh well, that was guard duty for you. Spend eight hours straight
watching Nappa snore, and then in a split second some chitinous thing
jumps out of the woods and tries to eat you.  At least here he
wouldn't have Vegeta making sarcastic remarks about his technique if
some demon did pop out of the rocks. Not that he expected one to; the
local river spirit seemed to be a pretty laid back sort.
<p>
Where was that kid wandering off to?
<p>
Trunks was safe enough with Kakarott and Gohan; Raditz hadn't promised
anyone to watch out for Kakarott's kids, but.. Goten was his
nephew. He shadowed the child as Goten wandered under the ferns.  The
big frilly leaves seemed to fascinate the toddler, who spent some time
wrapping a number of them around himself and wearing them in his hair.
<p>
Then he found the tree with the big slabs of shelf fungus growing up
the side.  "Climb!" he said, and started hauling himself up the tree,
using the fungus as a ladder.
<p>
"Kid, I don't think that's such a good idea," Raditz said, frustrated
at his immaterial condition and consequent inability to do much
without a great deal of trouble.  Where the hell was Gohan, or
Kakarott or even Trunks?  Not that a fall from this short distance
could really hurt a kid with this much Saiyan blood, but it still made
Raditz nervous. What worse trouble could this kid find unattended?
<p>
Suddenly Goten looked around, and jumped down to the ground again. He
looked through Raditz, apparently unaware of the ghost, and bellowed,
"GOTEN! I'M GOTEN!"
<p>
"No kidding--everything in the woods knows that now. I'm your Uncle
Raditz, kid--not that you can hear a word I'm saying, but what the
hell." If someone doesn't show up for this kid Real Soon, I'm going to
have to get Kakarott's attention. I really don't want to do that.
<p>
Goten stopped suddenly and cocked his head, looking in Raditz's
direction. "Nunk Rats?" He pointed at Raditz and grinned. "Nunk Rats!
Hair!"
<p>
Oh, crud. The kid CAN hear me. And see me. He's Ox King's grandson,
and too young to have learned that he's not supposed to be able to see
spirits.  Crud. He probably doesn't even know I'm a ghost, or what a
ghost is.
<p>
Goten charged and tried to tackle one of Raditz's legs.  He passed
right through the insubstantial spirit and banged into a tree.  "HEY!"
He rubbed his head, looking angry, and then jumped up and tried to
grab hold of Raditz's interesting hair.  He fell through empty air
again. He howled his anger. "NO FAIR! NO FAIR!"
<p>
"Yes, it's fair." Raditz squatted down by the youngster, and reached
out to grab him with one large hand. Goten's eyes went wide as the
hand passed through him without touching.  "Fair--you can't touch me,
I can't touch you."
<p>
Goten plopped down on the ground and thought about that for a bit. He
looked up at Raditz and pouted. "Fair," he conceded. "No fun."
<p>
"I agree, kid. It's no fun at all." Raditz sighed and stood up.
<p>
At this, Trunks came running through the woods. "Goten! Oh, you're all
right." He looked around; nothing but the empty woods and Goten
sitting by himself pouting.  "Why were you yelling?  Come on, I'm
going to be in trouble for letting you wander off when I was supposed
to be watching you."
<p>
"Nunk Rats," Goten explained. "Want hair, but no fun."
<p>
"Sure, whatever." Trunks rolled his eyes at the baby's inability to
speak coherently. At five, he felt immeasurably superior to the
toddler still in diapers.  Not only could he speak so that any adult
could understand him, he was learning how to write characters already!
Could Goten even count to ten yet?
<p>
Trunks seized Goten by the arm and half-dragged him back to the river,
to find a frowning Goku and sheepish Gohan waiting for them.  Gohan
scowled at Trunks as soon as he saw him.  He started to say something,
but Goku interrupted him.
<p>
"Trunks, sit down. Gohan, you were told to watch the kids. Why were
Trunks and Goten off in the woods by themselves?" Goku's voice was
calm but dangerous.
<p>
"Umm, I told Trunks to watch Goten.." Gohan gulped, knowing he was in
trouble.
<p>
"Trunks is only five, Gohan. He's still a baby, not old enough to be
looking after another baby."  Only Gohan could see the wink Goku gave
Gohan.
<p>
Trunks jumped up, indignant.  "I am NOT a baby! I can so look after
Goten." He looked downcast. "I was careless, sir. It was my fault, I
shouldn't have been paying so much attention to the fish. But I did go
looking for him when I noticed he was gone!"
<p>
Goku looked grave. "I'm afraid it was a mistake to trust you with that
kind of responsibility. By the time you noticed he was gone, Goten could
have fallen down a hole, been eaten by one of the dinosaurs roaming
the woods.." He shook his head.
<p>
Trunks bit his lip, struggling to hold back tears of shame. "It won't
happen again, Goku-san! I promise! You can trust me!"
<p>
Goku nodded solemnly. "I believe I can. However.." He turned to his
eldest son. "Gohan, you were responsible for supervising Trunks. You
let him down, you let me down. You're older than he is, I expect you
to be a lot more responsible."  Goku never raised his voice.
<p>
Gohan cringed; it was his turn for shame. "I'm sorry, dad. I do know
better, and I did let you down. I won't let it happen again, dad." His
face was crimson, and his heart was in his shoes somewhere--he'd
disappointed Dad!
<p>
"Let me show you something. Pick up Goten. Trunks, follow me." Goku
led the boys about a half-mile downriver, around a bend. Gohan gaped
as the river dropped abruptly in front of them; a waterfall.  The bank
they had been following also dropped off. Goku pointed down; Gohan
peered over the edge at a fifty-foot drop onto rocks and jagged,
broken driftwood. He turned white.
<p>
Goku didn't say a word, and Gohan and Trunks were silent as they hiked
back to their picnic site. When they got there, Goku turned back to
them, all smiles, and said, "We've got some nice fish here. Let's
eat!". He never said another word about what had gone before, and they
never forgot it.

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"Hey, guys!" Bulma yelled late one evening, several days later. "I
think we've got something!" She was at the computer, reviewing the
latest search results. "Gohan, remember the one about the village with
the well spirit that grants wishes?"
<p>
Gohan looked up from his studies. "Which one?"
<p>
Goten was sitting on the floor playing with his toys.  He looked up,
and smiled happily. "Nunk Rats."
<p>
Chi-chi, who had just finished cleaning up from supper, looked
quizzically at Goten.  "Does anyone know what Goten is saying?  He's
been saying that ever since Goku took him fishing. I can usually
figure out what he means, but 'nunk rats' is a mystery to me."
<p>
"The Japanese one," Bulma answered Gohan. "The kami of the underground
spring grants a wish every century, remember that one? I've found an
archaeology report on the excavation of an ancient village that might
correspond to the legend." Her voice was tense with barely restrained
excitement.
<p>
"Uh," Gohan answered, distracted between his mother and Bulma. "That's
nice. Mom, I think it must be something he sees in the woods. Trunks
says he's always saying that when they're outside exploring."
<p>
"'That's nice'?!?" Bulma exclaimed dangerously. "We've been working on
this for a month, and finally have some interesting results, and all
you can say is 'That's nice'?!?"
<p>
"That's great, Bulma! What have you got?" Gohan jumped up and hurried
over to Bulma, looking over her shoulder.
<p>
"Well, first," she said as she brought a map up on the screen, "the
report mentions the local folklore about the kami of the
spring. Second," she pointed out various features on the excavation
map, "the key landmarks in the legend are all there.  Third, the
university never finished the excavation." She lowered her voice so
that Chi-chi would not hear. "I made some inquiries; they never
reapplied for their grant after the professor in charge of the
expedition, and two grad students..  disappeared."
<p>
Gohan glanced at his mother, she seemed oblivious to their
conversation. "This is good?" He looked skeptical.
<p>
"It means Something is going on," Bulma whispered back. "Maybe not a
kami granting wishes, maybe it's someone else after the wish, maybe
something else entirely.  But it is Something, and Something is a lot
more promising than nothing.  I'm only going to investigate it, just
to see if there's anything to it.  If there is, and it looks
dangerous, of course I'll ask Goku to come with."
<p>
"Wait until next week, when I start vacation. I'm coming with you."
Gohan said, determined.
<p>
Bulma started to protest, but stopped after glancing at his face. She
knew that look on Gohan's face--she'd seen it on Namek when he turned
back to face Frieza--he would not be dissuaded by anything Bulma
said. Well, she would feel a lot safer having the young saiyan with
her, anyway--and whatever had removed three ordinary humans could
hardly be a match for one of the three--two, now--most powerful
fighters in the world, could it?
<p>
"Nunk Rats?" Goten said interestedly.
<p>
Quantum electronics were absurdly easy to touch, compared to large
material objects and people. Raditz reached past Bulma and scrolled to
the 'folklore' section of the report, and read the additional details
Bulma hadn't mentioned.  Evil sorceror; soul-stealing ghost warriors;
a curse on the village, and a captive kami in the power of the
sorceror. And--something *real* ate three people. Uh-huh.  Now he knew
why Vegeta thought Bulma needed watching over...
<p>
Bulma noticed out of the corner of her eye that the screen was
scrolling itself to sections of the report she didn't want to worry
Gohan and Chi-chi with.  She smiled, and moved herself in front of the
screen, trying to act casual, while simultaneously trying to hit the
"Save & Close" command without being seen. Gohan looked at her oddly.
<p>
"Nunk Rats fun?" Goten asked hopefully as he toddled over to the
computer.  He waved his arms wildly in front of Bulma, and
frowned. "No. Nunk Rats not fun," he said forlornly.
<p>
"What is with this kid?" Bulma scratched her head.  "AND WILL SOMEONE
TELL ME WHAT THE HELL A 'NUNK RATS' IS?!!?"
<p>
"'Puter fun?" Goten suddenly jumped up onto the console and started
poking at buttons.
<p>
"AAGGGHHH!" Bulma pulled him off the computer, but it was too
late. "NOOOOO!  He hit CANCEL! Now I've got to retrieve that report
all over again!"
<p>
"Well," Gohan grinned, "I guess that means you'll be ready by the time
my vacation starts."
<p>
"Ooooohhh!"  Bulma steamed.
<p>
"What's up?" Trunks came in, still toweling his hair dry. "Did I miss
something?"
<p>
"Miss what?" Goku finally wandered in, hair dripping. "Bulma,
why are you sitting on the computer?"
<p>
"AAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHH!"

<p>
"..and the camp house, and excavation mech, and spare scooter. All
right, that's all the capsules I need.. I think." Bulma counted
capsules in the small case, and tucked it into her belt pouch. She
watched Gohan loading supplies into the back seat. "Got enough food
there, kiddo? I've got a full fridge in the Capsule Camp House, ya
know."
<p>
"Well, I might get hungry. Besides, Mom insisted." Gohan looked a bit
sheepish as he tossed his book-pack in last, and headed back to the
house.
<p>
Bulma smiled knowingly; Chi-chi was convinced that they'd be reduced
to grubbing for roots and berries unless she packed a week's supply of
food for an overnight camping trip. Oh well, Gohan had nearly as big
an appetite as Goku and it wouldn't hurt to have a little extra.
<p>
Bulma bent over her pocket computer, studying the archaeology
reports. What to tell Gohan, and when? Engrossed in thought, she
didn't notice Goten until he was tugging on her sleeve.
<p>
"Nan Bulma! Go with you? Want go with Nunk Rats." He looked so hopeful
that Bulma hated to turn him down, but she knew better.
<p>
"I'm sorry, but you have to stay home with your mother; this isn't a
trip for little boys.  Trunks is staying home, too. Besides, I don't
have any 'nunk rats'." Bulma smiled and tousled the two-year-old's
hair.
<p>
Goten turned stubborn. "Nunk Rats go with, I want to go too!" Suddenly
his face fell and his lip started to tremble. "I can't go?"
<p>
Bulma put a finger to her lip as she thought. Something about the way
Goten was talking.. could it be that 'nunk rats' was a someone, not a
something?  But who? Who was Goten talking about?
<p>
Her thoughts were interrupted by Trunks charging around the corner
with a full pack on his back.  "Hey, Mom. Goten, come on!"
<p>
"Where are you going?" Bulma asked, feeling vaguely suspicious.
<p>
"Oh, I was going to take Goten exploring in the woods again, so he
wouldn't be all upset when you and Gohan left without him. Chi-chi
packed us both a lunch, too."
<p>
"We must have cleaned out the pantry, between us. Let me enter a
reminder to pick up some groceries on the way back." Bulma made a
notation on her pocket comp. "By the way, do you know who 'Nunk Rats'
is?"
<p>
Trunks shrugged. "I think he's Goten's imaginary friend. Goten
pretends to talk to him a lot when we're out in the woods." He started
to lead the now docile Goten off.
<p>
"Oh, that would explain it," Bulma said, a bit distracted. What was
holding up Gohan this time?  She went back inside to hurry him along.
<p>
Trunks peeked around the corner. The coast was clear! He hurried over
to the aircar, Goten in tow, and stealthily lifted the trunk lid. He
tossed his backpack in, grabbed a surprised Goten and stuffed him in,
and then climbed into the trunk himself.  As he was pulling the lid
shut, Goten started to protest.
<p>
"Nooo! Can't go! Nan Bulma said no; Nunk Rats said no." He tried to
push the lid open and climb back out; Trunks found he had to pull
surprisingly hard to keep Goten from pushing the lid open.
<p>
"Ssssh! They'll hear us if you keep yelling. Listen to me! Please,
Goten!" Some of the urgency in Trunks voice got through to Goten, and
he stopped fussing.  "Mom is going to find a wish to bring father
back.  I am NOT going to miss father coming back! I AM going to be
there when he returns," Trunks said fiercely. "And I have to bring
you, because I'm responsible for watching you, and I can't watch you
if I leave you in the woods at home, and if take you inside for
someone else to watch you, they'll ask questions about why I can't
watch you.  It's okay, you're safe with me, like Mom's safe with
Gohan. Your big brother Gohan is one of the best fighters in the whole
world, and he'll protect us. Father started teaching me to fight, and
your dad's been training me, too, so I can protect you from anything
bad out there, even if Gohan's not around. Besides, I thought you
wanted to go."
<p>
"But Nan Bulma.."
<p>
"Mom will be mad at me, not you, when she finds out, so don't worry
about it. It's something I have to do, Goten. I have to help Mom bring
father back." There was an odd tightness to his voice. They were
curled up together in the dark, cramped space; Goten felt around and
touched Trunk's face. It was wet with tears. He hugged his friend, not
understanding the older boy's grief, but desperately wanting to make
him feel better.
<p>
"Okay," Goten said simply, as the aircar hummed with power and lifted
off the ground.  After a short while, the boys fell asleep, lulled to
sleep by the steady hum of the aircar.

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"Whoa! Turn around, Bulma, I see it, it's right back there!" The
aircar circled over the remote mountain valley.
<p>
"I see it, kiddo! Boy, talk about remote and out of the way! I didn't
know there was any place left in Japan this far from anyone! No roads,
no trails, nothing. I don't know why people left this place to begin
with, but I can see why no one came back--without an aircar, you just
can't get here!"
<p>
The aircar circled lower over the ruins as Bulma guided it
closer. From the air, they could make out the overgrown foundations of
crumbled houses where the village must have been in the small valley;
up on the mountainside, a few walls of the monastery-temple still
stood. It, too, was overgrown; bamboo thicket choked the courtyard,
and kudzu crawled over everything.
<p>
"Gohan, can you see a place that is actually flat enough for us to
land? I can't tell what is under all this kudzu; I'd hate to drop us
in a sinkhole or something."
<p>
"How about that field over there? Wait, I'll check it out." With that,
the twelve-year-old boy jumped over the side and drifted slowly down,
levitating.  He landed on the field in question, a ancient grain-field
gone wild. He waved to Bulma; it was solid enough, and stepped aside
as Bulma brought the aircar down next to him.
<p>
How long, she thought, before Trunks starts scaring the daylights out
of me by doing things like jumping out of a car in midair? Vegeta and
Goku have already taught him to use his ki; Goku told me it was Trunks
that started the cook-fire for the fish they caught the other day. May
it be a long time, she prayed, before he has to use his power to fight
a real enemy.

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"There's something really depressing about this place," Bulma
said. She and Gohan looked around the ruined village. Not much more
than foundations remained; from the old archaeology report and the
aircar's camera shots, they were able to place major features such as
the village headman's house, the granary, the village well, and some
others. According to the report, the spring was marked by the remains
of a small shrine part way up the mountain toward the monastery.
<p>
"'Depressing' isn't the word I'd use," Gohan said, as the hairs on
the back of his neck stiffened. "It gives me the creeps." He looked
very Saiyan at that moment, with his hair spiking out.
<p>
Trunks would have agreed with Gohan if he'd heard him.  At the moment,
he was sneaking around the back side of the overgrown rubble of the
village, hoping no one would spot him and Goten.  Goten was unusually
quiet, and held Trunk's hand very tightly, as if he were desperately
afraid of losing him.
<p>
'Depressing' wasn't the word Raditz would have used, either--but then,
he could see what none of the others besides Goten could see. He knew
why Goten was clinging so tightly to Trunks; the living are rarely
comfortable in the presence of the restless dead.
<p>
"This place," he remarked to himself, "crawls." He could see the
village whole and complete, houses, huts, well, path, and shrine
above. And it was inhabited: the ghosts of the village walked its
vanished streets. Correction; they had walked the streets, until
Raditz showed up.  At the sight of the tall, long-maned saiyan ghost,
the spectral villagers had run for their spectral houses and hidden
behind closed doors and shuttered windows.
<p>
That is damn peculiar. It's not like I destroyed the place when I was
alive. This village has been dead since before Saiyans even made it
into space, so they're not hiding because I'm Saiyajin. So I'm big and
dangerous--if they were alive, I could understand them running; but
why the hell are they scared of another ghost when they're already
dead?  Crud. I can guess a few possible answers, and I don't like any
of them.
<p>
Raditz briefly considered kicking in a few phantasmal doors and
beating some answers out of the inhabitants, but a flash of movement
in the physical world caught his attention. He rose up and looked
around. Bulma and Gohan were setting up camp next to the aircar--Where
the hell did that domed cottage come from??--and the kids were...
<p>
No, I am NOT seeing this. Someone please tell me I'm alive and just
having a nightmare! Of course, Trunks would pick the one uncollapsed
area in the whole town to camp in and hide from his mother. Of course,
that would be the cemetery.
<p>
*Sigh* I'm going to have a busy night.

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"The village well is dry," said Bulma as she studied the map, "and I
think the spring feeds the well somehow.  Well," she said brightly,
"we were going to investigate the spring anyway, let's go see what the
problem is."
<p>
"Why are we concerned about the well?" Gohan looked puzzled as they
walked up the overgrown trail.
<p>
"Because of the curse on the village," Bulma explained patiently, as
if to a backward child.
<p>
"What curse on the village??" Gohan asked suspiciously.  He stopped
and faced Bulma. "What didn't you tell me about this place?" His hair
was spiking up again.
<p>
Bulma smiled and tried to look innocent. "Oh, just a few folk
tales.. But it's okay, I didn't keep any secrets from you that I
didn't keep from your mom or Goku."
<p>
Gohan crossed his arms and got a stubborn look on his face. "I'm not
moving."
<p>
Bulma grimaced, and handed her pocket comp to Gohan. "Look under
folklore; I knew I was going to have to tell you sooner or later."
<p>
He read quickly. "But the well is dry because the kami of the spring
cursed the village.  She cursed the village because the greedy headman
helped the sorceror capture her by blocking up the spring. So what are
we going to do?"  They started walking again.
<p>
"First, we are going to check out the shrine and the spring. Then I'll
make my plans."
<p>
It was a warm summer day, and Bulma was panting as she pulled herself
up the last bit of trail to the shrine.  Gohan simply floated along
beside her, offering a hand if she stumbled. "Next time, I bring a
grav belt," she muttered. "Even if I have to invent it first."
<p>
The shrine was fallen to ruin like the village, and at first Bulma
could see no sign of a spring.  Then she noticed that the ruined
shrine had covered a grotto.  Rocks choked the grotto, rocks that were
slick with moss and algae.  She felt them; they were wet.
<p>
"It's been blocked up," she told Gohan. So, at least that much of the
legend is true! "We're going to unblock it!"  She stepped back into
the open, cobbled area around the shrine and got out her case of
capsules.  "Stand back, kiddo!"  She carefully chose one, and tossed
it into the open area.
<p>
It grew and shaped itself into a strange, upright machine--something
like a large robot frame with a digging shovel on one hand and large,
industrial strength graspers on the other.
<p>
"One excavation mech, ready to go!"  Bulma climbed into the driver's
seat of the mech.
<p>
"Bulma, why are we doing this?"
<p>
"Can you think of a better way to get the kami's attention?"
<p>
"What if she doesn't like it, or isn't here?" Gohan called as Bulma
revved up the mech.
<p>
"We'll worry about that when the time comes!" Bulma yelled back
cheerily. CLANK! CRUNCH! The mech moved forward, and, after clearing
away what little rubble remained from the shrine's fallen roof and
walls, started pulling massive boulders out of the grotto.  Once the
heavier stuff was out of the way, Bulma used the digging shovel to
clear out the gravel and sand, until she hit another layer of
boulders.
<p>
By late afternoon, the grotto had been cleared, and a low wall of
boulders stacked all around the cobbled area in front of the
grotto. Gohan used his own power to lift all the loose sand, gravel
and mud out of the shrine and dump it down the hill somewhere.  His
last sweep of the stone pavement revealed a basin under the dirt; he
resumed his efforts and cleared it just as Bulma's mech pulled one
last, very wet rock loose.
<p>
Water bubbled out; a trickle at first, and then a stream. It ran down
the rock face of the grotto, and vanished into a crack in the
rock--but a small trickle spilled out and flowed into the basin,
slowly filling it. As they watched, the stream swelled to a torrent,
a waterfall rushing down into the depths of the earth.  Gohan
listened; far below, he could hear the thunder of a mighty river.
<p>
Bulma waited expectantly.. and waited. And waited.
<p>
"Well?" Gohan asked, as the sun drew near the horizon.
<p>
Bulma sat dejected on the boulder wall. "I was so sure something would
happen when I unblocked the spring.  So much for folktales." She
sighed. "Or wishes." One tear gathered unbidden at the corner of her
eye.
<p>
Gohan gave Bulma a quick hug. "Maybe something will happen
tomorrow. Let's go camp, I'm hungry."
<p>
Bulma hugged Gohan back, and laughed.  "You are so much like your dad,
it's scary.  I'm hungry, too.  Back to the hut." They worked their way
back down the trail in the reddening sunlight.
<p>
Gohan and Bulma turned to watch the sunset from the camp house. "I
read the rest of that archaelogical report, you know," Gohan told
Bulma. "You didn't mention the part where the archaeologists found
the villagers.. Something killed them all at once, long, long ago--no
one was left to bury them."
<p>
Bulma smiled sickly. "That does match up with part of the folklore.. I
so hoped that the part with the kami and the wishes matched up, too."
<p>
"Maybe it does, and we just haven't figured out how to talk to the
kami and get a wish, yet. Remember how hard it was to make a wish with
the Namek dragonballs before we knew how?" Gohan looked back at the
sunset and the ruined village, as Bulma nodded agreement.
<p>
"My grandfather once told me," Gohan mused, "that if you look
carefully at twilight you can see ghosts, because they become visible
when it is neither day nor night."  The sun was just slipping below
the horizon.
<p>
Bulma said "That's ridicu---" and stopped.  The whole village had
suddenly appeared, transparent at first, darkening to full visibility
as the twilight deepened. People walked the streets, and Bulma's hair
nearly stood on end as a farmer walked right past her toward the
village. It did stand on end as a young woman walked directly toward
her, hands out as if pleading.  Bulma could see her lips moving as if
she was speaking, but there was no sound.
<p>
"Eeeeeeeeee!"  Gohan caught her as she fainted.

<p>
As it grew dark, Trunks tried to explain to Goten why they couldn't
have a fire. "Mom will see it, and she'd catch us. We have to stay
secret, understand?"
<p>
"Too dark. Make a light?"  Goten pleaded.
<p>
"If I do that, Gohan will sense my ki! Only if it's an emergency,
okay?" Trunks dug in his pack; they'd already eaten the stuffed
dumplings he'd packed for supper, and spread out the sleeping
bags. "Here, I brought some chocolate. Have some."
<p>
Goten happily tore the wrapper off and crammed the bar in his
mouth. "Tha'k 'u."
<p>
"You're welcome."
<p>
Trunks had been too busy setting up camp to notice the spectral
village appear at twilight; by the time he was done, it was too dark
to see.  Goten, of course, had been watching it all day.  Trunks was
surprised that Goten hadn't wanted to run off and explore the ruins,
but he did not even begin the guess the truth.
<p>
Up on the moutainside, something malevolent stirred deep within the
ruined monastery. At long last, there were lives within its reach;
young, fresh, strong lives for the taking.  It was bound, and could
not move--but its servants could.  A whisper in darkness, in darkness
answered. Four dark spirits rose from their long slumber; four shadows
deeper than night took form, and crept down from the ruins towards the
village.  Above, an ancient evil put forth its hand, and sealed to
itself everything within its reach.

<p>
By sunset, Goku was worried, and Chi-chi was frantic. Search as they
would, there was simply no sign of Trunks or Goten. Chi-chi had
thought of the obvious, and had Goku call Bulma on her satellite
phone.  He'd casually asked--not wanting to worry her about Trunks
yet--if they had taken Goten with them. Bulma had sounded a bit odd,
but no, they hadn't taken the kids with.
<p>
Chi-chi looked at Goku.  "That's all she said?  Something's
wrong. Your question all but shouted 'the kids are missing', and she
didn't even ask about Trunks?? That's not like her."
<p>
Goku didn't have an answer for her; something even more disturbing had
his attention. Search and sense as he might, he could not feel or find
Trunk's ki, or Goten's ki.  It was as if they were in hiding.. or
dead.
<p>
He looked at his wife. "I'll go check on Bulma; if something is
wrong.." He tried to sense Gohan or Bulma's ki; to his horror, he
realized that he couldn't sense them, either.  It was as if they, too,
had dropped off the face of the earth.  It wasn't him; he could sense
Chi-chi and Ox King in the house, Master Roshi in his hut on the
island, Piccolo out in the desert, Tien and Chaozu at their place,
Kulilin, Yamcha, Karin, so many, many others--but not his sons, and
not his oldest friend and her son. And not Vegeta, but Goku at least
knew why he could not sense his old enemy/comrade.
<p>
"Chi-chi," he said, his throat tight, "call Bulma again."  Chi-chi
looked at him oddly, and punched in the number.  No answer; the phone
was off or unreachable.
<p>
"I'm going to get Piccolo," he said. "Then we're going to find Gohan,
and everyone else." Goku's face was set and grim.  Chi-chi nodded
mutely, and Goku headed out the door and took flight.
<p>

<p>
"I'm scared," Goten whimpered. "Bad things out there."
<p>
Trunks didn't know what was 'out there', but he didn't like it. There
were things moving and stirring all around them in the old cemetery,
and the worst thing was that Trunks couldn't sense them. They had no
life force that he could feel, not even the dim glow of animals.
<p>
"Don't be scared, I'll protect you," Trunks said with forced bravado.
He felt all cold and crawly inside, almost like.. fear. No!  He was a
Saiyan prince, he would not allow himself to be afraid! He gritted his
teeth, and gathered power, all thoughts of secrecy forgotten.
<p>
"Make a light! Make a light!" Goten cried urgently. "It's a 'mergency.
Nunk Rats says so!"
<p>
"I'll take your word for it." Trunks' ki flared up into a floating
ball of light, illuminating the cemetery.  His heart pounded and his
breath seemed to catch in his throat; everywhere he looked, the ground
stirred and heaved.  Several grey, gaunt, almost skeletal forms crouched and
crept toward him. One was almost close enough to spit on; it snarled
and showed sharp, pointed teeth and hideously long, clawed fingernails.
<p>
Trunks shouted involuntarily and lashed out; his foot smashed into the
monster's chin, shattering its jaw and breaking its neck. The thing
reeled back--and stood up, its head lolling from side-to-side on its
broken neck. It reached out for Trunks, who grabbed Goten and backed
away from the thing in horror.
<p>
"Nunk Rats!" Goten yelled jubilantly. What the hell? Trunks couldn't
see anything but the grey ghoul-things.
<p>
"Use your ki, Trunks! Burn the damn thing, NOW!"  A fierce voice
snarled out of the night, and for the briefest instant, Trunks thought
he could sense a very strong ki--but very, very far away, somehow. He
seized power and flung it.
<p>
The white blast of ki hit the ghoul-thing like a blowtorch hits paper;
nothing but smoking bones dropped to the ground. They did not rise
again.  Three more monsters darted forward; Trunks blocked and struck
with a flurry of attacks, then blasted the broken forms that still
clutched for him with hungry claws.
<p>
"First lesson, young prince, in killing jiki-niku-gaki: slow them, if
necessary, with physical attacks, but burn them to destroy them!"  A
soft, fierce voice, whose owner Trunks still could not see. There was
something eerily familiar about the way he spoke--but no, it was not
Father!--that would have raised the hairs on the back of his neck if
they weren't already standing on end.
<p>
The voice continued, "Goten, if anything bad gets past Trunks, hit it
as hard as you can. You are much stronger than you think, youngest
warrior."
<p>
Several more of the ghoul-things rushed Trunks, only to meet the same
fate as their predecessors. He panted with the exertion, his heart
swelling with a fierce pride: he, Trunks, was a warrior like his
father! With his own power, he killed monsters, and protected his
little friend Goten.  "Thank you, Father," he whispered, "for teaching
me how to fight. And may I remember to thank Goku-san as well, when we
get home."
<p>
Suddenly the ghoul-things stopped, and fell back.  Trunks sensed
something.. not right. Something malefic and insatiably hungry rose
out of the night, beyond the jiki-niku-gaki. It appeared in the shape
of a sickly green luminescent warrior, armed and armored as an ancient
samurai. It raised its hand and gestured; the earth heaved and graves
opened to reveal dozens more ghoul-things. Then the demonic warrior
strode forward.
<p>
"Trunks, deal with the gaki; this one's mine."
<p>
To Trunks' amazement, a very big, powerful warrior appeared out of the
night and landed lightly in front of him, facing the oncoming demon
samurai. Trunks couldn't see many details; they were all obscured by
the huge mane of hair spilling down the warrior's back--but he
recognized the armor. It was very much like something his father once
wore.  Once again, that sense of powerful, but very distant ki...
<p>
"Nunk Rats!" Goten cheered, and then Trunks was too busy with the
ghoul-things to worry about the stranger Goten seemed to know.
<p>
The demon samurai ghost hesitated at Raditz's appearance, bringing its
spectral blade into guard position.  Raditz could sense its voracious
hunger for life force, for ki--and he knew that Trunks had no chance
at all against the thing.  Unlike the gaki, it had no physical form to
block or strike, and it fed on ki; it would reach right through the
young prince's defenses and drain his life away until the boy fell
dead. Correction: it would have, except that Raditz was between it and
its prey. Raditz grinned evilly, and raised his own blade.
<p>
A quick flurry of lunge, parry, feint, parry as the two spectral
warriors circled, testing each other.  Yes; the demon samurai was very
skilled with his blade, more skilled than Raditz--but not fast enough.
<p>
Just.. (Parry, feint, a blur..)
<p>
..not.. (Raditz *behind* the samurai ghost-thing..)
<p>
..fast.. (A backhanded strike too fast to see..)
<p>
..enough! The demon ghost's hand and blade spun away, severed at the
wrist. Raditz completed the circle, reversed his blade, and the
counterstroke sent the other ghost's head and body flying in seperate
directions.  With a soul-chilling howl, the thing faded from sight;
Raditz noted that the broken spirit fled upward, toward the
mountainside--and the ruined monastery.
<p>
"You won't be back tonight."
<p>
Raditz turned to check on the kids. A flaring curtain of white fire
dazzled him for a instant as it surrounded Trunks and Goten.  What??
He's learning fast! The kid's getting good--figured out how to do an
area blast in the middle of the fight! Raditz grinned.
<p>
Trunks stood, gasping for breath. Goten hugged Trunks tightly around
the waist. All around them lay piles of smoking bones. Nothing else
moved. He cooly regarded the ghostly warrior; he could see him clearly
now.  No doubt about it; the big man was a Saiyan: peaked, stiff hair
so much like father's, the shape of his eyes and face, the distinctive
armor, and, if there had been any doubt, the furred tail wrapped
around the ghost's waist.
<p>
"You're Goten's 'Nunk Rats', aren't you?  Who are you really? And why
can I see and hear you now?  Goten's seen you all along, hasn't he?"
<p>
Raditz returned Trunks' stare with one of equal coolness. "You have a
lot of questions, young prince. And--" Raditz broke off, seeing two
streaks of pallid blue and red light dart across the sky, toward the
other end of the village--toward Gohan and Bulma. "No time for that!
There's two more of them! Get over to Gohan, NOW! I can't defend you
on opposite sides of the village at once, and Gohan doesn't know how
to fight them!"
<p>
Raditz started through the village, then turned to glare at Trunks,
who hadn't moved. Goten was frozen to his waist.  "MOVE! Goten, forget
the village ghosts--they're too scared of ME."  He laughed evilly. At
that, Goten let go of Trunks and ran pell-mell down the village
street, Trunks on his heels. Raditz plunged through the air, a
spectral white streak.
<p>

<p>
Bulma sat bolt upright.  "Gohan! Wake up! I'm an idiot! Where's
Trunks???"
<p>
"Huh? What?" Goku's oldest son blinked sleepily. "Isn't he at home?"
<p>
"You idiot! Goku called to ask if we had Goten--didn't that seem a bit
strange to you?  Goten is ALWAYS with Trunks; they were together when
we left this morning. Ooooooh! If I hadn't been so rattled by those
ghosts, I'd have known something was wrong!  Get up, we're going
back!"  Still clad in her night shirt, Bulma fumbled around looking
for her phone.  "I'm going to call and find out just what is going
on!"
<p>
She punched the codes in repeatedly; no signal. "That's funny, I can't
get a link. Maybe outside.." She wandered out the front door, still
fiddling with the satellite phone.
<p>
"Don't bother, I know where Trunks is." Gohan followed her outside,
his voice odd. He pointed across the village; white light flared and
subsided in the distance.  "I can feel his ki; he's right over there,
and he's in a fight. So is my little brother. I can't sense who
they're fighting, though."
<p>
Bulma could hear the fear in his voice; it paralleled the fear in her
heart. What was happening to her son? Gohan glowed with power and
leaped into the air--
<p>
--and a lurid red streak flashed through the air and struck him.
Gohan cried out and fell to the ground, his power extinguished.
Looming over him was the form of an ancient samurai, glowing with a
lurid red light.  Bulma screamed and jumped back as a second spectral
samurai appeared and struck at her, this one glowing a ghastly pale
blue. She fell back into the camp house, and the phantom warrior
hesitated, as if confused by the dome house in the middle of the
field.
<p>
Gohan staggered to his feet, feeling weak. That monster's blow had
stolen part of his power!  He leaped into the air after it, dodging
and striking. To his horror, his blows went right through it, hitting
nothing but air.  It counterattacked; Gohan dodged the spectral blade
easily, but made the mistake of instinctively blocking the thing's
bare left hand.  The spectral hand plunged through his arm and into
his body, and Gohan screamed as he felt his life being ripped away.
<p>
He fell away from the thing, hitting the ground heavily.  As blackness
rolled over him, the last thing he saw was an armored body slamming
into the spectral red samurai; the last thing he heard was the crack
of ghostly bones; and the last thing Gohan wondered was, "Where'd the
Saiyan come from?"
<p>
Bulma took cover behind the bed, hoping the blue ghost warrior
wouldn't see her. It ducked through the low doorway and entered the
dome house slowly. It moved and hesitated, as if the small house
confused it. Step by hesitant step, it drew steadily closer to
Bulma. She backed up until there was no place left to retreat to;
cornered, she faced the thing. It reached for her--
<p>
--And halted as a forlorn wail echoed off the walls, its head turned
sharply toward the door. It plunged toward the door, seeming less
confused on its way out than it had been coming in.  Just as Bulma
drew a deep breath of relief at her narrow escape, it stopped suddenly
at the doorway.  Bulma's heart shuddered momentarily; was it coming
back?  Then she realized it had halted with two feet of oddly
translucent sword blade protruding from its back.
<p>
As she watched, a large hand grabbed its shoulder and pulled it
forward, out of her sight. A blade swung and flashed; something howled
its thwarted rage into the night. Bulma collapsed, shaking in reaction
from her brush with death.
<p>
Something rushed through the grass outside; words were exchanged.  A
small figure peeked in the door.
<p>
"Nan Bulma okay?" asked Goten.
<p>
Bulma sat and stared at him dully; Goten was here? Then Trunks...
<p>
Worried by her silence, Goten toddled over to Bulma and hugged her.
She grabbed him and hugged him back as hard as she could.  "Oh, Goten!
Yes, Nan Bulma is okay. I'm okay!" She kissed the little boy on his
forehead. "Trunks, where's Trunks?"
<p>
"Trunks 'kay.  Trunks help Gohan. Gohan's hurt," Goten said, looking
worried. "Nunk Rats stopped bad red ghost that hurt Gohan." He hugged
Bulma again. "I was scared. Trunks burned up bad things; Nunk Rats
kill bad green ghost, an' get bad blue ghost that chased Nan Bulma."
He hugged her some more. "Nunk Rats go watch bad yellow ghost up on
mountain, an' Trunks help Gohan," Goten finished his report, climbing
into Bulma's lap.
<p>
She cuddled the little boy.  "You've been through a lot today, haven't
you?  There is one thing I still don't understand.."
<p>
"What, Nan Bulma?"
<p>
"WHO IS NUNK RATS???"

<p>
I can see him now, the fourth demon warrior. He's a yellow flame above
that ruined temple; doesn't seem to be in a hurry to come down and
challenge me. His friends didn't do too well. Heh.
<p>
Raditz smirked to himself. Demons, I can handle. He looked down.
Goten was asleep in Bulma's bed; Bulma and Trunks were taking care of
Gohan, and arguing over who was going to keep watch.
<p>
Good, the kid will live. Some rest and food and Gohan will have his
strength back, and probably more. Heh. We saiyajin are tough that way.
<p>
He glanced back at the fourth demon samurai, still hovering in the
distance. I really want to go after you, but if I do, and there are
more of you around.. He glanced down at Bulma and Trunks again. No. I
can't risk them.  Damn you!
<p>
Why did I accept this burden? Why did I promise Vegeta--stupid
questions. I know the answers already. My prince, in that other life I
swore loyalty to you 'unto death', but there is a bond between us that
transcends even death--but damned if I understand it.
<p>
We were the last of the Saiyajin: we suffered exile and humiliation
together under Frieza, and we fought every battle knowing that not
only could it be our last, personally, it could be the last battle of
the Saiyan race. We were doomed together.
<p>
From Nappa I had friendship, from you I only wanted respect.  I never
got it. There was no room in your heart for respect; those weaker than
you were tools to be used in your war with Frieza; those stronger than
you were Frieza's allies, hated and schemed against.  Until Kakarott.
<p>
The bitterest torment of Hell is this: to have all one's comforting
illusions stripped away, to face one's self as one truly is, to know
the truth--and to know the truth others saw.  I was another tool to
you, discarded and forgotten when I failed you. You never respected
me, my prince--and I never respected myself.
<p>
What lies between us now?  I don't know; once, I would have turned my
back on you when you sought me out in Hell. But you've changed, my
prince; you're not the empty-hearted bastard I once followed.  That
Vegeta would never have sought me out and asked me to protect his mate
and child.  That Vegeta never respected me that much; that Vegeta
never cared about another that much.
<p>
Perhaps I wanted to take the measure of your respect, find out what
you had entrusted me with. The answer appalls me; I was never worthy
of THAT much respect. Am I now?  I don't know; we'll find out. I know
only that I, too, have changed; I'm not the same Raditz as I was when
I died on that grassy field eight years ago.
<p>
That wasn't the only reason.  I wanted to go back.. to see Kakarott
again.  My brother..  and I don't have the courage to make myself
known to him.  How ironic!  To think that I once held him in
contempt--until the moment I knew he died willingly to stop me.  No
fear, no hesitation, but the willing surrender of his life to his old
enemy to stop me--to protect Earth from me.  I could not have done
that.  I didn't even understand it, but I respected him for it, even
as I died.
<p>
I still don't understand Kakarott, but I am in awe of him. He is the
Super-Saiyan of legend, the destroyer of Frieza, without doubt the
greatest warrior in the universe. Yet he does not conquer and rule the
weak, but protects and defends them. He is so very unlike we
Saiyajin--and yet..  I still remember what father told me when I said
that of Kakarott, what he told King Vegeta when the king said that of
Kakarott at Frieza's fall: "Kakarott is not as we were; rather, he is
what we should have been."
<p>
What I should have been.
<p>
I like the kid. He looks like Kakarott did that day he was put in the
capsule for Earth, the day I set out on my first mission as an adult
warrior.  He sees and hears me, and isn't afraid of me.  He doesn't
know what lies between his father and I, or his older brother and I;
he simply accepts me.
<p>
But if anyone else calls me "Nunk Rats", I'll kill them.
<p>

<p>
"No arguments, Gohan. Even if you were in shape for a fight, the kids
are in too much danger. I can search for another wish, another
day. Right now, we're getting out of here."  Bulma encapsulated the
camp house and put it back in her case.  It was shortly after dawn;
Trunks and Goten ate breakfast from the extra supplies Chi-chi had
sent along. Gohan slumped in the front passenger seat of the aircar,
nibbling listlessly at his breakfast.  His face was pale and drawn.
<p>
He smiled weakly at Bulma. "I guess it's a good thing that Mom packed
that extra food.  The kids are starved."
<p>
"Yes, I know. They had a busy night," Bulma said archly. She put her
hands on her hips and glared at Trunks, who ducked his head and stared
intently at the ground.  "When we get back, young man, I'm.. no. I'm
not going to do anything. I'm going to let you explain personally to
Chi-chi why you dragged her baby Goten with you on this little
adventure."
<p>
Trunks cringed. Goten reached over and grabbed another steamed
dumpling. "Mom! That's.. that's not fair!"
<p>
"Sounds reasonable to me. YOU COULD HAVE GOTTEN THE BOTH OF YOU
KILLED!"  Bulma wiped away a tear. "I've lost your father, I don't
want to lose you. Not ever." She wiped away another tear.
<p>
"Mom." Trunks looked ready to cry. "I didn't know it was this
dangerous--I thought Gohan could protect you from anything.  And I
thought I could protect Goten--and I did!" he declared fiercely.
<p>
Goten noticed that Trunks was paying no attention to his dumpling and
snatched it up and stuffed it into his mouth.
<p>
"Hey!" Trunks yelped. "This is the thanks I get for saving your life?"
He reached into the hamper and grabbed another dumpling, hanging onto
it tightly this time.
<p>
"Nunk Rats, too." Goten pointed out between mouthfuls.
<p>
"Yeah, he helped." Trunks took a bite out of his dumpling. "Told me
how to kill those gaki things, and stopped the green samurai ghost."
He quickly ate the rest of dumpling.  "Cut his head right off!"  he
said with relish. "Way cool. Then on the way over, I saw him hit the
red samurai, I guess that was the one that hurt Gohan, and I think he
got the blue samurai, too."
<p>
Bulma made a face. "I missed all that. I didn't see anything! Who or
what is this person?"
<p>
Trunks shrugged.  "I dunno. I thought he was just Goten's imagination,
you know, like a pretend friend, but then he appeared out of thin
air when the green samurai came after us.  And Goten called him that
silly name like he knew him, and he told me how to kill the gaki, and
I was pretty busy after that."
<p>
Bulma looked ready to scream. "Trunks! You already said that
part. WHAT IS HE?"
<p>
Trunks looked puzzled. "I think he's a ghost. Maybe Goten can see
ghosts."  He looked thoughtful. "That would explain why he didn't want
to run through the village, or go explore it."
<p>
"ARRGGGGHHH!  I figured that out already! I mean, what kind of person
is he? All you've told me is that he's a he, and nothing else! For all
I know, he's not even human!"
<p>
"Well," spoke up Gohan, "if that was him that I saw just before I
passed out, he was wearing Saiyan armor."
<p>
Bulma stared at Gohan open-mouthed, and then snapped back to
Trunks. "Trunks, it wasn't.. it wasn't.." her voice faltered.
<p>
He shook his head. "No, it wasn't Father." He looked directly into his
mother's eyes. "He was Saiyajin, though no one I've ever seen before.
And he had a tail."  He thought a moment, as his mother sat,
stunned. "He called me 'young prince'; I think he knows Father."
<p>
Bulma laughed nervously. "That would make.. a certain kind of sense."
She shook her head. "I guess you just lucked out and got a guardian
angel from your father's side of the family." She looked around;
everyone was mostly finished eating.  "Let's go, and worry about who
the family ghosts are when we get home."
<p>
Gohan looked at Bulma, worried. "Bulma, there's something wrong.. I
can't sense Dad, or Piccolo, or anyone.  I can't sense anyone in the
whole world but the four of us."
<p>
Bulma gulped. "And I still can't get the phone to work. Maybe the
mountains are too high.. Get in, we're leaving now!"
<p>
Within minutes, everyone was in the aircar, and it was lifting off the
ground.  Bulma goosed the throttle, and they roared up the valley
toward some of the lower mountains.  They crested the mountain and
dove down into the next valley.
<p>
"Look, there's another ruined village just like..." Bulma trailed off.
She could see the ruined monastery, and the freshly cleared shrine
uphill from the village. "It's the same one! Gohan, somehow I've
gotten turned around.  Keep an eye on the compass, the CIN-GPS isn't
working for some reason."
<p>
She tried it again, cruising over the mountain pass only to find
herself heading back into the same valley.  "Gohan, what is going on?"
<p>
"The compass flipped, I saw it!  Right when you entered the pass, the
compass needle flipped completely around!"
<p>
"I don't like this.."  She tried departing the valley in another
direction. Once again, they returned to the valley. She tried again,
climbing higher, only to find the car diving toward the ground once
they climbed above the highest peaks.  No matter what direction they
tried, they always found themselves heading back into the valley as
soon as they crested the mountains or entered the pass.
<p>
Finally, defeated, Bulma returned to their original landing site, and
set the car down. "We're trapped."
<p>
"Something doesn't want us to leave." Gohan shivered. "Something
powerful. Something evil."

<p>
"Something dark." Gohan stared at the monastery on the mountain's
slope. Both kids were napping, and Bulma was yawning.  Gohan still
looked thin and tired, like he'd been ill for a week. He'd been
staring at the monastery, apparently lost in thought.  "Something with
a lot of secrets."
<p>
Bulma looked at Gohan, determined. "Secrets we're going to learn; I
don't know what we're facing, but it's got a weakness, and we're going
to find out what it is."
<p>
"It might not have a weakness, any more than Frieza did." Gohan sounded
demoralized.
<p>
"Bad example, kiddo.  Whatever is here, doesn't want us talking to the
outside world, and it doesn't want us leaving--it doesn't want us to
bring in Goku and Piccolo and everyone.  It's afraid there's someone
out there that can stop whatever it is up to.  Remember why Frieza was
so desperate to kill all the Saiyajin?"
<p>
The light dawned in Gohan's eyes. "Because he knew there would someday
be a Saiyajin who could kill him!"
<p>
"Exactly! And you know something? I know that whatever Goku and
Piccolo can do, you can do, too! If we find out what our enemy's
secrets are--"
<p>
"We can defeat him."  Gohan looked a little better, though still pale.
"I'm hungry. Are there any of those dumplings left?"

<p>
Damn. He's not in as good a shape as I thought. He should have
recovered by now.  Unless that demon warrior took more out of him than
I thought.. But when I blew through the bastard and broke him, I
didn't get that much energy--where'd it all go? Think, Raditz!
<p>
A ghost's memory: slamming into the baleful red samurai from behind,
cracking his spine; plunging a spectral hand between the demon-ghost's
ribs and into the heart of his essence; ripping that heart out,
stealing the soul energy of the manifestation, breaking it, forcing
the ghost samurai back into the spirit world, stripped of
energy--yesss! Missed before, a thin shadowy thread of spirit linking
the ghost samurai to.. what? Something.. up.. there.  Raditz looked at
the ruined monastery. Looked again, in the spirit world.
<p>
Aiyeeee! Would you look at the place--that's no monastery! Raditz took
in the triple walls, the towers, the high central keep.  I do not like
this. Every otherworld fortress that I know of belongs to someone from
the lower hells--including King Vegeta's new palace. Heh. Can't say I
miss THAT place so very much.  But this place! I've never heard of it
before, and it's on the Borderlands--a reflection of something from
the physical world?
<p>
So. Something's up there, besides Yellow-belly; something the red
demon-warrior was feeding power to.  It's full daylight, they can't
manifest anymore than I can--no threat to the living.. until dark.
Let's go get Gohan's energy back before then, hmmm?  Raditz smiled
evilly.

"Oooooh! If only everyone here weren't dead, or I could hear ghosts
like Goten! How am I ever going to find out what is going on?" Bulma
tossed her pocket comp down in a fit of annoyance. "According to the
legend, the evil sorceror was either killed or imprisoned forever by
some wandering holy hermit, who founded a monastery on the site. That
place up there," Bulma pointed unnecessarily. "The stories don't
explain what's keeping us from leaving, who those technicolor
demon-warriors were, why the spring was still blocked up, or why this
village is haunted."
<p>
Gohan picked up her pocket comp and looked through the files. "Well,
maybe the holy hermit didn't like the kami of the spring--she did
punish the whole village because of one man, the greedy headman. A lot
of innocent people might have gotten hurt because of that. The
sorceror sounds like he was evil enough to kill the villagers.."
<p>
"But the story of the hermit specifically mentions the villagers
celebrating after he overcame the sorceror.  I don't think they'd do
that if they were dead, kiddo." She frowned. "We're missing something
important here."  She got out her case of capsules and searched
through them.
<p>
"Now what?" he asked as Bulma tossed a capsule to the ground and
watched it swell into a flying scooter.
<p>
"Now we're going to the spring, and maybe the monastery after
that. Let the kids sleep," she said, answering his question before
Gohan got any further than opening his mouth. "They're in no more
danger here than they would be anywhere else, and probably
safer. Just a minute while I leave a note for Trunks."

<p>
Raditz hesitated; where in this phantasmal fortress was the power he
sought?  The very walls blocked his senses, and when he tried to drift
over the outer wall, he found himself flung to the "ground" outside
the wall.
<p>
Crud. I hate this kind of crap. Whoever--whatever--built this damn
place imposed his own rules on its reality. One of them seems to be
fake gravity.  Idiot. We're friggin' spirits here, what's with the
fake physical bullshit?
<p>
He wants to play at being physical, I'll go along. Heh.
<p>
Raditz lept nimbly to the top of the outer wall. The outer court
appeared to be a grassy plain; beyond it loomed the middle
wall. Nothing stirred--wait! A flash of yellow, like fire, on the
balcony of the middle wall. Raditz snarled, and leaped again, with a
burst of power. He flung out his hand and blasted a hole through the
covered balcony just before he hit it.
<p>
Something wispy and powerless fled before him. Not the one he
sought. He ignored the riotous garden filling second court, and
focused on the glowing warrior mocking him from the broad stairs
leading up to the base of the inner wall.
<p>
Raditz's eyes narrowed. It was leading him on, deliberately. Why?  He
jumped, landing hard on the stairs.  The yellow warrior started,
apparently not expecting the sudden move, and ran. Raditz bolted after
it, gaining rapidly--then it turned a corner and vanished.  Two
corridors, three doors, a not-very-secret door, no enemy.
<p>
Crud! Doors, walls, hidden passages, vanishing enemies--screw this!
He wants to get physical, let's get physical--Saiyan style!
<p>
Raditz screamed and kicked out the side of the wall.  Massive blocks
of stone fell to reveal a stagnant pool filling the inner court,
surrounding the central keep.  He jumped straight up, tucked, rolled,
and dove through the roof of the keep.  Tiles and great wooden beams
crashed down with him; he batted the debris aside as he landed.
<p>
"You are a powerful one." In the center of the great hall, on an ivory
throne, sat something like a man. "And wonderfully wicked--a true
killer. I can taste it in your soul."
<p>
He was chained to the throne with thin silver links--a hawk-nosed man,
long dark hair tied back in a pony tail, dark unfathomable eyes. He
wore yellow silk robes, ornately patterned; around them a leopardskin,
held in place by a great golden clasp in the shape of a leopard's
head.  He clutched the arms of his throne with long bony hands tipped
with incredibly long nails; thin lips curved in an evil smile.  Twin
spiral horns of translucent crystal rose from his temples.  And he was
alive!
<p>
The shock of it stopped Raditz cold.  This was the spirit of a living
man, tied to a body--and more. He looked past, back into the physical
world; in place of the man chained to the ivory throne, he saw a stone
statue half-buried in an empty cell of the monastery. Here in the
spirit plane, the man--if man he was--seethed with power. A shadow,
like a second spirit, clung to his spirit form; above and around him a
half-seen nimbus of unknown power hovered.  Living, but bound; living,
but fully aware in the spirit world; living--and more than living.
<p>
Those unfathomable eyes looked deep into Raditz. "Yes. You have the
strength; you defeated my Ochimo." His voice was vibrant, cultured,
and crawled into Raditz's soul like a venomous serpent. "I know what
you desire; I can give that to you.  Take the place of my Ochimo,
free me, and you will stand at my right hand when I stretch it out to
rule.  Yesss, stand at my right hand--a living man! I have the power
to restore your form and your life, O lost and angry one."
<p>
Raditz did not move, did not answer. Shock, wonder, horror flashed
across his face.
<p>
"You doubt me?" the demon-sorceror laughed coldly. "I am the Opawang;
mine are the secrets of life and spirit. There are many ways I could
restore you to physical existance--and if you desire true, breathing
life, with all its pains and vulnerabilities, I can grant that as
well.  But only--" he snarled, "if you free me."
<p>
Finally Raditz stirred. "How?"
<p>
"Bring the living to my prison, and cause them to break the stone that
imprisons me, I care not how.  I will be freed, and their strength
will be mine, and the Black Earth River Daughter will once again heed
her master's commands and grant my wishes.  Serve me, and you will be
rewarded beyond your comprehension!"
<p>

<p>
"Hmmph!" Bulma stood beside the grotto with her hands on her hips. "I
don't see that anything has changed since yesterday.." She trailed off
as something caught her eye in the water.  She stared into the
overflow basin; Gohan watched her curiously.
<p>
"Umm, Gohan, could you come here and look at this?" Bulma sounded
odd.
<p>
"Sure." He looked in the water, noting their two reflections--no, that
wasn't his reflection! That was a girl!  And what he thought was
Bulma's reflection was another woman, a woman with blue skin and dark
green hair.  He looked over his shoulder. There was no one there
besides the two of them.
<p>
"Do you suppose they know we're here?" Bulma asked nervously. She
jumped as the blue woman nodded.
<p>
"You can hear me?"  The woman nodded again.
<p>
"Can you talk to us?"  The woman frowned, and shook her head. The girl
behind her simply looked sad, and Bulma realized she was the ghost
Bulma had seen last twilight, the pleading girl.
<p>
"Well, at least we can handle 'yes' and 'no'.  Too bad my first
question is 'Who are you?'" Bulma pursed her lips. "Work with me on
this." She looked at Gohan. "Gohan, if you've got any ideas or
questions, out with 'em, any time.  Meanwhile," she handed him her
pocket comp, "keep notes."
<p>
"Yes, ma'am."
<p>
"Okay, you there in the pool--are you the kami of the spring?" The
blue woman nodded.
<p>
"Are you the one who is keeping us from leaving?"  The kami shook her
head angrily.
<p>
"Do you know who is responsible for trapping us here?"  She nodded
grimly.
<p>
"Do you grant wishes?" The kami frowned, and held up one finger, and
then nodded.
<p>
"You can grant only one wish?" The kami hesitated, shrugged, and
nodded.
<p>
"What did all that mean?  Never mind, I know you can't answer
that. Let me guess, you can grant one wish, but there's some kind of
special condition or limitation?"  The kami looked thoughtful, and
nodded.
<p>
After a frustrating hour of yes and no questions, Bulma and Gohan knew
that whatever was keeping them trapped in this valley dwelt in the
ruined monastery, it was the evil sorceror of legend, the sorceror had
been imprisoned by the hermit a long time ago, the brightly colored
demon-warriors served the evil sorceror and had killed all the people
in the valley, and--this last the worst blow to Bulma--whatever the
limitation on the kami's wish was, it kept her from restoring Vegeta
to life.  He could not be wished back to life using the kami's wish.
<p>
Bulma almost seemed to wilt, and sat down for a while, trying futilely
to hold back the tears.  Finally, she wiped her eyes and nose and
lifted her head.  "I am NOT giving up on this! We are going to find
out what the problem is, and we are going to escape this wretched
valley."
<p>
Gohan looked thoughtful. "If only she knew sign language..."
<p>
Bulma blinked. "What? Sign language? Hand me that computer!" She
almost snatched it from Gohan in her hurry.  "Let me see... Indian
signs.. American Sign Language.. A-HA! Japanese Sign Language. Gohan,
I think you hit on one hell of an idea there!"
<p>
She turned back to the pool. "Hey, kami-of-the-spring! You've been
real patient with us so far, let's not stop now.  Can you spell?  You
know, write? That is, if you had paper and ink and brush?  Or read?"
<p>
The kami looked puzzled, but nodded.
<p>
"Great! Watch me, and listen up, 'cause Bulma's gonna teach you
something important!" She dug around in her pockets, and came up with
a pen and paper, which she gave to Gohan.
<p>
"Gohan, draw the katakana characters for me." After he drew the
first one, Bulma snatched it up, and held it up for the kami to
view. Gohan continued to draw the characters.
<p>
Bulma made the sign for the character. "This is 'shi'," she enunciated
carefully. "Repeat it back so I know you've got it."
<p>
Dawning wonder spread over the kami's reflected face, and she
hesitantly made the sign back to Bulma.
<p>
"Yes! You've got it! Now, the next sign is..."
<p>

<p>
"Can't you hurry it up?  My babies are out there somewhere, and no one
can find them!"  Chi-chi yelled at Dr. Briefs, who was working on the
computer Bulma had used.  "Goku, are you sure you can't find them?"
<p>
Goku shook his head.  "Piccolo and I have both searched
everywhere. Neither of us can sense them anywhere."  Piccolo said
nothing, but just stood there scowling. Goku still looked worried. "I
even asked King Kai, and he couldn't find them either." He couldn't
bring himself to voice the one grim possibility that would explain his
inability to find them.
<p>
He didn't need to. The growing terror in Chi-chi's eyes and voice
showed that she already knew of that possibility. No! Somehow, they
would find them.  The only clue Goku knew of was in the computer files
and reports that Gohan and Bulma had been pouring over for weeks, but
Goku knew about as much about computers as Dr. Briefs did about
fighting. Chi-chi and Piccolo weren't much better, so they'd called
Dr. Briefs to help.
<p>
Bulma's father had not been worried that Bulma was missing, at
first--he was used to her disappearing on strange adventures only to
turn up at home, months later, with exciting stories and weird new
friends. Goku and Chi-chi's evident worry got him to worrying, too;
what had happened to his little girl, and his grandson? Losing his
son-in-law had been bad enough...
<p>
"Ah, here it is." Dr. Briefs stubbed out the cigarette he'd been
smoking. "Interesting little place--" At Chi-chi's scowl, he cut off
what'd he'd been about to say. "What you'll want are the coordinates
of the place."  He pulled a small device out of his pocket, spoke a
string of numbers into it, and tossed it to Piccolo. "That's a
handheld CIN-GPS; I've programmed the location of the village Bulma
meant to investigate into it.  Just follow the directional indicator
until you get there; range is that number at the lower left. At the
lower right is the switch for the map display, if you want to see
where you are."
<p>
"Thanks!" Goku grinned, his optimism returning. "Piccolo?"
<p>
Piccolo was already on his way out the door. "See if you can keep up,
Goku," he challenged in his usual slightly sinister voice.
<p>
As Dr. Briefs watched them go, he wondered aloud, "Should I have
mentioned the folklore report?  Bulma did have it marked 'PRIVATE',
but there's some pretty scary stuff in there."
<p>
"OH, REALLY??" Chi-chi said.
<p>

<p>
Raditz stared at the Opawang, paralyzed by the enormity of the
demon-sorceror's offer. To be restored to life, and power--to have a
body again, to breathe, to eat, to enjoy all the pleasures of mortal
life--to fight again as one living, pitting his strength and power
against a foe, risking everything in the fury of combat--oh yes! That
would be joy!
<p>
But the cost: to break his promise to Vegeta--to fail him yet again.
To throw away all honor, all trust, all respect to restore his
life--as he had once done, trying to save his own life in the fight
with his brother Kakarott. To betray the innocent child--his own
nephew--who trusted him--that he had never done.
<p>
So many tyrants had ruled him...
King Vegeta's command: "Serve me!"
Frieza's orders: "Serve me!"
Young Prince Vegeta's command: "Serve me!"
The Opawang's demand: "Serve me!"
<p>
..and in Hell, Vegeta's plea: "Protect THEM."
<p>
It wasn't a hard decision at all.
<p>
He raised his head, and looked behind. The yellow Ochimo guarded the
doorway into the hall, watching and waiting. Raditz turned back to
face the Opawang.
<p>
"What of your other Ochimo?"
<p>
"Weaklings. They could not defeat you, they are of no further use to
me. You are stronger than they, and far more worthy." Dark shadows
seemed to fill the hall, emanating from the Opawang's throne.
<p>
Raditz laughed. Yeah, he'd have been just an expendable tool to this
bastard, too. "Go to Hell! In fact," he grinned evilly, "I'll send you
there!"  At the speed of thought, the ghost katana appeared in his
left hand, and he dove forward--
<p>
--or started to. The dark shadows seemed to take substance, become
cords of darkness that wrapped around his ankles, wrists, legs,
body. Each touch was cold, draining the energy from Raditz--only the
merest trickle at first, but there were so many...
<p>
"You arrogant fool! Pathetic ghost, I am the Opawang, the Dead Spirit
King! You are so perfectly vulnerable to MY power--" the chained
sorceror laughed chillingly. "a pity you would not join me. I could
have used a spirit of your rare power and violence."  He snarled. "If
you will not serve me, you will FEED me!"
<p>
Raditz felt his strength draining away through the shadow cords to
feed the Opawang.  One chance, before I'm too weak.  He gathered his
strength, and slashed the katana across the cords just as he hurled
himself away from the Opawang--and straight at the yellow Ochimo.
<p>
The ki-sucking cords parted, and the Opawang screamed with rage. "Stop
him, Ochimo of Fire! Don't let him escape!"
<p>
The Ochimo of Fire never had a chance. Raditz slashed him across the
throat with the blade even as he plunged his right hand into the
ghost's chest and ripped out his heart and power.  He didn't stop, but
slammed through the broken spirit, and through all the walls and doors
between him and the outside.
<p>
Once beyond the fortress's weird pseudo-physics, he turned to face
it. It looked like a rather large projectile had smashed through it
from keep to outer gate. Nothing pursued him, so Raditz took a moment
to absorb the power he had stolen from the Fire Ochimo.  It was not as
much as had been stolen from Gohan, but it would do. Between the red
Ochimo and the Fire Ochimo, he'd taken enough power back to get Gohan
back in fighting shape.
<p>
Kakarott's kid would need it. The Opawang had to be the one
responsible for trapping them in this valley, and Raditz knew one
thing for sure; he, Raditz, could not defeat the Opawang alone.

<p>
"Come on, sleepy-head! Get up!" Trunks shook Goten, who yawned and
turned over.
<p>
"You'll miss lunch..." the purple-haired boy said enticingly.
<p>
"Mmph?" Goten opened both eyes and looked around.  Trunks waved a
baked meat pie just out of reach. "Gimme!" Goten jumped and tried to
grab it.
<p>
Trunks snatched it back.  "That was rude. No lunch until you're
up, and you ask nicely."
<p>
Goten stood up on the bunk.  "Gimme, please!"
<p>
Trunks sighed and handed him the meat pie. "I guess that'll
do. Listen, Mom and Gohan have gone off to the spring on the other
side of the village while we were asleep. I think we should go with
them; Gohan was hurt bad last night, and I can protect Mom if those
monsters attack again."
<p>
Goten frowned and looked worried. "Bad things get Nan Bulma?" He
stopped eating the baked wrap.
<p>
"No, no. I'm just worried that they MIGHT, if I'm not there." He was
stuffing some more meat pies in his pack. "Besides, your friend said
we should be with them, because he can't protect people in two
different places at once.  He was right, and that works for Gohan,
too.  He can't protect us and Mom if we're in different places."
Trunks tossed a first aid kit in on top, and closed the pack.  "Pull
your clothes on and let's go!"
<p>
A few minutes later they stood at the edge of the village. Trunks
turned to encourage Goten, and was startled to see him charging
through the village already.  He scampered to catch up with him.
<p>
"Hey! I thought you were too scared of the ghosts to just run through
here like this!"
<p>
"Nunk Rats scared ghosts," Goten answered confidently.
<p>
"Uh, yeah. I guess he would." Trunks thought briefly of the fierce
Saiyan warrior who had appeared and destroyed the green demon-samurai.
I'll have to ask Father about him when he gets back.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Well, at least that wasn't a complete fiasco. Now where have Gohan and
Bulma gotten to?  I see; the spring. And the kids.. aren't with
them. Great. I really needed this. Didn't you people learn anything
from last night?
<p>
The kids are back at camp--no, they're not.  There they are, in the
middle of the village, heading west.  Why?
<p>
Raditz watched as Trunks paused at the western edge of the village to
read a map. Along with the map, Trunks carried a note. Raditz looked
at them both.
<p>
He's going to the spring. Good, everybody will be in one place, but
why--oh, crud. Of course, the note his mother left for him.  Is that
crazy woman really going up to the ruined monastery?  This is
bad. Very, very bad.  How the hell do I stop her?  Vegeta, my prince,
what the hell did you talk me into?
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"This has been so cool; we can actually hold a conversation now!
Gohan, read back what we've found out."  Bulma was jubilant.
<p>
Gohan adjusted the pocket comp. "Well, the kami in the pool is the
Black Earth River Daughter; she's the daughter of the mountain kami
Black Earth Mountain Sister. The evil sorceror is called the Opawang,
and he holds Black Earth River Daughter hostage--he's captured part of
her soul, so she has to obey him and grant him wishes. Because he
holds Mountain Sister's daughter hostage, the Mountain Sister obeys
the Opawang, too--that's why we couldn't leave, and that's why no one
can get in; the mountain kami is using her power to confuse and hide
travelers to trap us.  River Daughter can only grant one wish per
century, and her wishes only affect things and people within this
valley--where she has power--that's why she can't bring Vegeta back,
he's not in the valley.  The Opawang is imprisoned somehow in the
monastery, and the colored demon-warriors are the Ochimo, Spirit
Warriors of the elements in his service. They're all dead, like the
villagers, but their master has given them the power to drain ki and
feed it to him, increasing his power. Now that the monastery is
deserted and all the holy monks gone, the evil spirits are free to do
their master's bidding." Gohan stopped for breath. "Oh, yes, and she
can't talk to people because the Opawang took away her voice."
<p>
"So all we have to do to get out of here is free the River Daughter
from the Opawang's power, and then the Mountain Sister would probably
stop following his orders.  Is that true?" Bulma asked the River
Daughter.
<p>
The reflection in the pool signed back, &lt;That is true. We hate evil
and would rebel against the Opawang the instant we were free.&gt;
<p>
"But how do we free you?  I still can't figure that out--do you have
any ideas?  I know you're very smart, to learn signing that fast."
<p>
The kami frowned and shrugged. &lt;I don't know how you can; he holds
part of my essence in a cage in his fortress, in the spirit world. You
would have to be a spirit to go there, but his power is absolute over
spirits--he is the Opawang, the Dead Spirit King.  Spirits cannot
fight him; they would be devoured or imprisoned.&gt;
<p>
"I thought you said he was imprisoned! And there are ghosts all over
the place here, they haven't been eaten or captured by this Opawang!"
<p>
&lt;Not so. The Opawang's body is imprisoned in stone in this world, and
his spirit is chained to his body, so that it cannot stray from his
throne in the otherworld--but my stolen half-soul is kept near his
throne, and within his power.  Outside his fortress, he has to use his
servants, the Ochimo.  They can drain the ghosts of the village, but
they are forbidden to enter village dwellings, so the villagers hide
indoors whenever the Ochimo are about.&gt;
<p>
"Hmmm.. That might be why the Blue Ochimo acted so confused when it
chased me into the camp house.  It was a dwelling, I suppose, but not
a village dwelling.  I bet it didn't know whether or not it was
supposed to be there!  Lucky for me, I guess.."
<p>
She paced, deep in thought. "If only there were a way to bring the
Opawang's fortress into this world!  Then maybe we could figure out a
way to defeat him and free the River Daughter."
<p>
Gohan looked unhappy. "I suppose we could wish it here... but that
might make things worse."
<p>
"We're trapped in this valley and at night we'll be hunted by
soul-stealing demon-warriors or eaten by those ghoul-things that
attacked Trunks.  How could we make things worse?" Bulma asked.
<p>
"I'm not sure, but I have a bad feeling about it."  So, apparently,
did the kami; she looked very disturbed.
<p>
"All we have to do is figure out how to phrase the wish. The fortress
is some kind of construct in the spirit world, but we have to make
sure we get the stolen half-soul as well as the fortress--so we have
to wish ALL spirit and spirit things in the kami's power back to this
world." Bulma smiled, her eyes shining with excitement. "That would
get not only the fortress, and the kami's stolen half-soul, it would
bring all the poor villagers back to life!  It's perfect! Let's do
it!"
<p>
Gohan nodded, caught up in Bulma's enthusiasm.  "Let's do it!"
<p>
Bulma turned to the kami in the pool. "Black Earth River Daughter, I
wish that ALL spirits and spirit things in your reach be restored to
life or transferred to the physical world!"
<p>
&lt;Thy wish is granted!&gt;  The pool swirled, and turned inky black; the
spring in the grotto thundered; water poured from the grotto and
overflowed the pool, rising in a swirling cyclone; the sky turned dark
and the earth trembled; a waterspout formed, rose high into the air,
and exploded; sheets of spray crashed down all around.  Bulma hugged
Gohan and held him tight through the chaos surrounding them.
<p>
A little ways downhill, Trunks grabbed a bent old treetrunk, and
grabbed Goten's arm as the earth shook and tried to throw them back
down the hill; Goten had already seized Trunk's nearest leg and
gripped it as tightly as he could.  A spray of water, like some
torrential hurricane downpour, fell out of the sky and soaked them.

<p>
The sky cleared, the earth quieted, and the pool returned to being
just a pool--except for the farm girl sitting in the middle of it
sputtering and wiping wet hair out of her face.  It was the girl of
the second reflection, the pleading ghost, looking very much alive and
well. Bulma looked at her, and reached out a hand to help her up.
<p>
"Hi! I'm Bulma, welcome back to the living!" The girl smiled, and
grabbed Bulma's hand and pulled herself to her feet.  Bulma glared at
Gohan, who seemed to have forgotten his manners, and was standing
motionless, staring wide-eyed and horrified at her.  No, staring at
something behind her. She started to turn around--
<p>
"That was a remarkably careless wish." A soft, fierce voice, somehow
familiar.  Bulma spun around.
<p>
Raditz sat on the stone wall about ten feet away, very much alive. He
looked as she remembered him from that dreadful day when Goku first
died--a big, powerful Saiyan with incredibly long, full hair, wearing
Saiyan armor with the extended shoulder pieces. His armor appeared a
bit worse for the wear: a large fist-size hole burned through the
middle of the chest (and back, Bulma knew), but the body underneath
the armor seemed intact, if a bit wet. He smirked.
<p>
"EEEEEEEE! You're Goku's evil brother Raditz! WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE?"  Bulma could not keep the fear out of her voice.
<p>
"It's so nice to be remembered. You just wished me back, you know. I
do thank you for that." He looked amused.
<p>
"Raditz!" Gohan growled, crouched in fighting stance.  He began to
power up. "I'm a lot stronger now, and I remember what you did to my
dad!"
<p>
Raditz looked at him oddly. "Kid, that's very old history. Don't be an
idiot; I'm not the enemy here." He started to get to his feet--
<p>
--at that moment, Goten charged up the trail into the shrine, Trunks
chasing after him.  "Nunk Rats! NUNK RATS!"  He bolted past Gohan and
jumped on Raditz, hitting him full in the chest.  Off balance, Raditz
staggered and went down, Goten on top of him.
<p>
Goten stood on his chest, yelling with delight. "NUNK RATS FUN! NUNK
RATS FUN!" He grabbed a handful of the Saiyan's hair.  "Got hair now!"
Goten laughed happily.
<p>
Gohan's jaw dropped; Bulma stood there gaping like a fish.  They
looked at each other, stunned.
<p>
"'Nunk Rats' is RADITZ???" Bulma's eyes bulged with incredulity.
<p>
Gohan blinked. "'Nunk Rats'.. Uncle Raditz. Of course." He looked
appalled. "How?"
<p>
Trunks staggered in, chest heaving from exertion. He was too winded to
speak.
<p>
Goten stopped laughing for a second, and looked slyly at Raditz. "Nunk
Rats fair?  Goten no fair?"
<p>
Raditz, still flat on his back, grinned, and reached a hand up and
gently tweaked Goten's nose. "Fair, kid. You can touch me, I can touch
you. Heh."
<p>
"Oops." Goten rubbed his nose and laughed.  "Nunk Rats fair an' fun!"
<p>
"I gotta agree with you on that, kid. It's definitely more fun this
way."  He ruffled Goten's hair fondly.
<p>
Bulma raised an eyebrow.  "Gohan, I find it hard to be terrified of
someone who is flat on his back having a conversation with a
two-year-old.  I think you can stand down, kiddo."
<p>
"He.. knows him. Goten really can see ghosts!" Gohan sounded as
shocked as he looked.
<p>
Trunks finally got his breath back.  "Hey, Mom, that's the guy I told
you about, the one that fought the demon-warriors!"
<p>
Raditz finally sat up, gently depositing Goten on the ground. "You did
a good job cleaning up those gaki yourself, young prince." He flashed
Trunks a thumbs-up.  "Did Vegeta teach you that area blast, or--"
<p>
Trunks shook his head. "Father mentioned it a few times, but hadn't
taught it to me yet.  I figured out how it had to work, and tried
it. It worked." He smiled proudly.
<p>
Bulma threw up her hands. "Well, it's nice to know you're all cozy with
each other! Why am I the last person to know about this??"
<p>
Gohan muttered, "I didn't know about it." He looked at his little
brother Goten, who was happily climbing Raditz's hair to sit on his
shoulder. He felt betrayed.  How could his little brother like
this.. person who had hurt Dad and caused his death?
<p>
"--And will someone explain to me why Raditz's ghost was here to be
wished back in the first place??" She put her hands on her hips and
glared at Raditz. "Let's start with the former ghost; maybe you have
some answers!"
<p>
Raditz smiled slyly, his eyes half-closed. "Vegeta asked me to watch
over you and Trunks, and protect you as best I could, so I did." He
got to his feet, setting Goten down again.
<p>
"Y-Y-You've been following me around as a ghost? I DON'T BELIEVE
THIS!" Bulma sputtered. "Can't a girl have any privacy?" In spite of
his feelings about Raditz, Gohan couldn't help snickering.
<p>
Raditz blushed. "I haven't been following you THAT closely," he
muttered. Gohan had to sit down, he was laughing so hard.  Bulma
glared at him. Trunks blushed but chose wisely to keep quiet.
<p>
"Of all the people Vegeta could have picked--why did he pick--Oh! I
guess he didn't have a lot of choices, did he?" Raditz nodded
briefly. "Why wasn't Vegeta here himself?" Bulma asked wistfully,
tears starting to fill her eyes.
<p>
Raditz looked at the distant mountains, avoiding Bulma's eyes.  "You
know he can't be wished back with the dragonballs a second time.  He
couldn't.. he couldn't take knowing you were alone and unprotected--"
(and that you were crying yourself to sleep every night for grief of
him--but Raditz couldn't bring himself to say something
so.. unsaiyan), "--so he went on a quest to find his way back."
<p>
"Back?" Bulma looked both worried and skeptical.
<p>
"To life."
<p>
A single tear ran down her face as she smiled. "Of course! He never
took 'impossible' as an answer--he'd always plot a way around whatever
was stopping him."  Her mood shifted, "But if he'd been following me
around, instead of you, he would have been wished back right now! The
idiot!  Ooooohh! When I see him again..."
<p>
"Bulma. I think you should see this." Gohan looked uphill, his voice
oddly strained.  She turned to look.
<p>
"Oh.. my." The Opawang's fortress loomed above the mountainside where
the ruined monastery once stood. Three encircling, tiered walls and a
high central keep; keen-eyed Raditz grinned as he noted the great hole
blasted through the outer gate. "I guess the wish really worked."
<p>
Raditz scowled. "Possibly too well--there were some.. nasty things
wandering about the spirit realm--and you just brought them to life."
<p>
"Why? Is it something you can't handle?" Bulma's hands were on her
hips, her words a challenge.
<p>
"I didn't say that!" Raditz glared at her.
<p>
"Do you mean the demon-warriors?" Trunks ventured.
<p>
"No. I can handle them. It's their master, the--"
<p>
"--the Opawang," Bulma interrupted.
<p>
Raditz looked surprised. "How--"
<p>
Bulma pointed to the pool. "We've been having quite a conversation
with the Black Earth River Daughter. She's very talkative once you
figure out how."
<p>
The young farmer girl, who had been sitting quietly listening to
everything in obvious bewilderment, jumped up at the mention of the
Opawang.  Fear filled her eyes.  "No! You must not! Oh please, tell me
you have not freed him!"
<p>
Bulma patted her and spoke soothingly. "Of course not, we would never
turn such a monster loose." She glared sidelong at Raditz.
<p>
Raditz looked at Bulma almost pityingly. "Don't be a fool, woman!  The
Ochimo serve him, and your wish would have restored them as well.  As
living beings, they can almost certainly free their master."
<p>
"How do you know that?" Bulma's voice was tight with fear.
<p>
Raditz smirked.  "The Opawang told me how to free him, when I paid him
a visit in the spirit realm.  It wouldn't be hard." His tail unfurled
and switched from side to side.
<p>
"You.. talked to him?" Gohan growled dangerously.
<p>
"Heh. Yeah. He was impressed with how I easily I defeated his
Ochimo. He wanted me to serve him in their place.  His offer
was.. very attractive." Raditz's half-smile seemed very evil.
<p>
Gohan's voice was flat with anger. "Attractive enough?"
<p>
Raditz smirked, glancing sidelong at Trunks and Bulma. "I told him to
go to Hell." His tail twitched. "I don't expect you to understand,
kid, I don't expect that anyone who hasn't been there could
understand--but I'm tired of being some bastard's expendable
flunky. Opawang's just another Frieza as far as I'm concerned.
<p>
"He doesn't take rejection very well. I found out how dangerous he is;
I couldn't fight him. Not as a ghost. I barely got away from him."
Raditz's voice was impassive, but his tail twitched; running from the
Opawang grated on him. "Did some damage on the way out; the Fire
Ochimo won't be quite the same for a long time." Raditz smirked again.
<p>
"By the way, kid, I have something that belongs to you." He moved
suddenly, closing with Gohan. Gohan flung his arm out to block the
blow, but Raditz's touch was light as a feather. Golden light flared,
and Gohan felt warmth filling him and his strength returning.
<p>
"What--" he gasped, swaying with the shock of it.
<p>
Bulma shrieked. "You bastard! What did you do to him?"
<p>
"No, it's okay, Bulma." Gohan got his voice back. "I was just
startled.  He gave me my energy back, I think." Gohan looked
puzzled. "How did you--"
<p>
Raditz shrugged. "You were in no shape to fight; I need you able to
fight. The Earth Ochimo and the Fire Ochimo provided the energy,
though not.." Raditz smirked once again, "voluntarily."
<p>
Bulma looked sheepish.  "Oh. Sorry I screamed at you. You're not
someone I expect the best of, you know."
<p>
"I know." He was abrupt. "Get over it! You are my prince's consort,
Trunks is the young prince, Gohan and Goten are my nephews and
Kakarott's sons.  I'm not Frieza's flunky anymore, Vegeta isn't in the
planetary extermination business anymore, and I like to think I've
gotten over being a total ass." His tail furled about his waist again.
<p>
He looked down at Bulma, arms crossed, speaking in that soft, fierce
voice. "Understand this, woman--you, your son, and Kakarott's sons are
under MY protection!  I would not harm any of you, and I would die
again before I let anyone else hurt you! Do you understand me?"
<p>
Bulma gulped and stepped back. "I think.. I understand."
<p>
Gohan stepped forward. "I'm protecting Bulma," he said flatly. The
challenge was in his eyes as he glared at Raditz.
<p>
Raditz simply looked exasperated. "Gohan," his tail uncurled and was
lashing back and forth again, "you are more powerful than I," Raditz
seemed pained at the admission, "but, one, I'm responsible to Prince
Vegeta for Bulma and Trunks' safety; two, I intend to give a good
answer to Kakarott about YOUR safety when this is all over; and three,
Bulma and I are the only adults here--and Bulma doesn't fight.  I
think that leaves me in charge, kid. Not that I'd stop you or Trunks
from protecting Bulma--but I'm protecting both of YOU.." he paused to
let it sink in, "so when I say 'duck' or 'get the hell off the
battlefield', you do it! Do you understand?"
<p>
Gohan glared at him, still angry. "Bulma?"
<p>
"I hate to admit it, kiddo, but what Raditz said makes a certain
amount of sense. However.." she looked at Raditz, "I'm responsible to
Goku and Chi-chi for Gohan's safety and this group in general.  I'm in
charge until the fighting starts, and the minute it stops. Got that?"
<p>
Raditz's tail lashed back and forth. "I don't like it--but I'll live
with it." His eyes narrowed as he looked at Gohan. "What about you,
kid? If I can't depend on you in the middle of a fight..."
<p>
Gohan nodded, looking unhappy. "Just.. I won't do anything Dad
wouldn't do.  Remember that!"
<p>
Raditz looked even more annoyed; the vein on his forehead stood
out. "Don't be a fool! I am NOT going to tell you to commit mass
murder or anything like that!"
<p>
"You did tell dad--" Gohan muttered.
<p>
"*Ahem*" Bulma tapped her foot impatiently. "Good, now that that's
SETTLED.." She glared at both of them; Raditz calmed down somewhat.
<p>
She shook her head. "I'm going to have fun explaining this to Goku and
Chi-chi when we get back. 'Goku, your baby and Trunks sneaked off to
join us, it turns out all the folklore about an evil sorceror and
soul-eating ghosts is true, and oh by the way we wished back your dead
brother Raditz and he's in charge'." She rolled her eyes.  "Now I know
how Kulilin felt when he was sent to tell Chi-chi that Goku was dead
and Gohan was kidnapped by Piccolo. Well, at least I wouldn't eat
dinner, spend the night, and run away without even breaking the news!"
<p>
Raditz looked a bit puzzled, and shrugged. Not his problem. Goten, who
had climbed back up his hair to his shoulder again, laughed and
gripped his uncle's hair tightly. Raditz glanced around. "Now that
we're done with that, is there anything to eat around here?  I'm
hungry!"
<p>
"ARRRRGGGGGGHHHH!"

<p>
"No! I am NOT going to have you and the kids scattered all over this
damn valley again! Not with those elemental samurai bastards and who
knows what else running around... It was a enough of a nightmare the
first time!" Raditz was adamant; he stood with his arms crossed and
glared down at Bulma.
<p>
Bulma wasn't having any of it. "Excuse me? We are not taking Goten or
Trunks anywhere near a fight that has you and Gohan in it--NO WAY!
I've nearly gotten killed just standing within a mile of fights like
that--I will NOT take the kids into that kind of mess. I never saw you
fight Goku, but when Gohan gets fired up, it's like being near a small
nuclear war!  Besides, you've already admitted that Trunks can fight,
if necessary." She glared back, hands on her hips.
<p>
Raditz scowled. "He's pretty good--for his age." He paused, trying to
find the words that wouldn't wound the boy's pride. "But he doesn't
yet have the EXPERIENCE! For all his power, he would have died last
night if I hadn't been there to take on the Ochimo--because he had no
way of knowing how to fight the bastard!" Raditz nodded toward the
looming castle. "What other surprises are up there?  What else might
come hunting you while we are up there fighting who knows what?  If
you come with Gohan and I, I know where you are, I know where 'they'
are, and we can keep any unpleasant surprises away from you and the
kids. What part of that don't you understand? You keep looking at me
like you don't know the language I'm speaking."
<p>
Bulma looked like she was ready to scream.  "Is being thick-headed and
stubborn standard for all Saiyans? You, Vegeta,.. even Goku drives me
crazy sometimes!"
<p>
Raditz started to retort, but Gohan interrupted him. "Bulma, you and
the kids could wait for us in that sheltered spot below the
walls--you'd be close enough that we could get to you if there was
trouble, but the mountain wall should protect you from stray blasts
and things like that."
<p>
Raditz frowned. "I don't like it--they'd be too far away to keep an
eye on."
<p>
Bulma scowled. "I don't like it--we'd be too close to trouble."
<p>
Gohan shrugged. "Well, I tried."
<p>
Bulma looked at Raditz thoughtfully.  "I suppose," she said, "it's
what we'll do."
<p>
An ironic smirk. "Classic compromise--we both hate it. Yeah, that's
what we'll do."
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"This doesn't make sense, Goku." Piccolo and Goku hovered above the
mountains. "No matter what we try, we can't reach these
coordinates. It's like a chunk of the map has been removed from
existance."
<p>
Goku closed his eyes, listening, sensing. Finally he opened
them. "No. Something is blocking us; I can feel it.  Feel for it,
Piccolo."
<p>
Piccolo closed his eyes and cleared his mind.  "I feel it now. Like a
barrier to the spirit--a barrier that says 'Go away, there's nothing
here, go around'--"
<p>
Goku looked uncharacteristically worried. "I can't get past it," he
added, "No matter what I try."
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz soared above the wall, followed closely by Gohan. The big
Saiyan pointed out the broken southeastern roof of the main keep. "In
through there, all the way down, is his throne. Do you actually know
what we're looking for?  I didn't see anything that looked like--"
<p>
A great note pealed out, near deafening them; the whole mountain rang
like a gong. The sky turned dark above the keep; black clouds whirled
and rapidly spread out from there to cover the whole valley.  The wind
howled and lashed them, where it was stillness but moments before.
<p>
Raditz alighted atop the outer wall, Gohan beside him. "What the hell
is happening? I don't like the look of this!"
<p>
Gohan scanned the sky worriedly. "This.. looks too much like a dragon
summoning--but there's no dragon."
<p>
"So someone--namely, the Opawang--is summoning something else. I'm not
waiting until he finishes the job!" Raditz snapped, and plunged back
into the sky. He dodged as lightning cracked down from the black sky,
and dove toward the hole in the roof--only to stop short. The hole was
gone; the roof stood whole, as if it had never been damaged.
<p>
Raditz summoned energy, cupped it in his hand, and threw it. The
entire roof exploded. A few flaming beams fell from the far side of
the keep, but the rest of the roof was utterly gone--vaporized. Raditz
looked down.
<p>
The Ochimo of Fire was waiting for him; not a spirit this time, but a
living warrior hovering in mid-air, crackling with flame.  He extended
his hand and flung a bolt of fire at Raditz. Raditz blocked and
deflected it, sending it splashing against the inner wall. He sneered.
<p>
"You losers just don't get it, do you?  You're so outclassed it's
pathetic! If I wasn't looking for something here, I could just
vaporize this whole damn castle in one blast, and be done with the lot
of you! Better run while you still can."
<p>
He glanced up at Gohan. "I'll amuse myself with this fool and whoever
else joins in; you get down there and find the kami's soul-cage."
Raditz dove into the Fire Ochimo, sliding past his blade and slamming
his fist deep into the Ochimo's gut.
<p>
"AAAAGGGGHHH!"
<p>
PAIN! The nimbus of fire around the Ochimo was no illusion, and no
earthly fire.  It seared Raditz as he struck, assaulting his defenses
with the power of his own blow turned against him. Raditz's blow flung
the Ochimo against the wall with shattering force; Raditz reeled in
mid-air, holding his seared arm. The Ochimo dropped limply to the
floor below; Gohan plummeted past, looking for the soul-cage. The
ivory throne was empty. The room was not.
<p>
The Earth Ochimo's sword sliced through the air; Gohan dodged it
easily, and struck back.  He was rocked back by the force of his own
blow; the Earth Ochimo was as hard and heavy as stone! Gohan set his
teeth and summoned power; the whole room shook.
<p>
The Fire Ochimo stirred and ascended once again; he appeared unhurt,
as if Raditz had never struck him. Beams of white-hot flame shot from
his eyes. Raditz dodged, and flung energy back. The sphere of energy
enveloped his enemy and detonated, blowing a large hole in the wall
behind him.  The Fire Ochimo's flame vanished, as if it had been blown
out by a high wind.  The elemental warrior appeared otherwise unhurt.
<p>
Gohan blasted his opponent; the Earth Ochimo tumbled before the column
of white-hot energy like a leaf in a hurricane. He crashed all the way
through the thick stone wall and disappeared with a loud splash. Gohan
looked hurriedly around the room. It was circular and rimmed with
statue-filled alcoves alternating with closed doors. The ivory throne
sat on a low dias in the center of the room, facing an entrance hall
to the east.  He saw nothing that looked like it might be the
soul-cage of the kami. Gohan calmed himself and concentrated, trying
to sense what might be here.
<p>
Raditz hit the Fire Ochimo again, with less force--a blow he could
stop with his own defenses, should it be somehow turned against him
again. The Ochimo slammed into the wall again, and Raditz felt no
pain. Without that nimbus of fire, the Ochimo was nearly defenseless!
Raditz grinned evilly.
<p>
Gohan sensed Raditz and the rapidly fading power of the Fire Ochimo,
the Earth Ochimo crawling out of the pool outside, another similar
power somewhere below, dark, horrid spirits in the sky above, and
something horribly powerful and evil to the northwest, beyond the
pool--and it was AWARE of him!
<p>
"AAH!" Gohan gasped out. "Raditz, IT KNOWS WE'RE HERE! This is a
trap!"
<p>
"What?" There was a small explosion of fire, and something limp and
bloody tumbled to the floor. The Fire Ochimo was no more. "So what if
it is?  They have a few surprises, but not enough power! Where's that
damn soul-cage?"
<p>
"You don't understand--I sensed its power! It's horrible--like Frieza
or Cell all over again."
<p>
"Its power? Gohan, what are you talking about? Whose power?"
<p>
"MINE, young fools!"
<p>
He stood on air, hovering above them, garbed in the yellow silk robes
of an emperor, wrapped in a leopardskin cape secured with a golden
leopard's head clasp. Long black hair tied back in the fashion of a
great noble, fine, proud features, dark unfathomable eyes, and twin
translucent horns spiralling from his temples, glowing with their own
light.
<p>
The Opawang looked down at the two Saiyans, and held out in one hand
the limp body of Goten. Beside him hovered the other two Ochimo; one
held Trunks, unconscious, and the other held Bulma, also unconscious.
<p>
The Opawang smiled.

<p>
Bulma yawned and awoke. Her head ached abominably; she groaned and
started to open her eyes.
<p>
"Mom?" Trunk's voice sounded anxious. He sat beside her, looking
worried. Bulma blinked, and looked around. They were in a strange
room, furnished in antique oriental splendor: silk wall hangings, fine
Persian rug, black-lacquered, brass-trimmed furniture, ornate
brass--or was it gold?--lamps..
<p>
"Where are we?" she asked.  She sat up, and groaned again as her head
spun. Trunks looked a bit under the weather as well.
<p>
"I think we're prisoners in the castle." He nodded discretely,
indicating the guard at the other end of the room.  Bulma recognized
the muscular woman in blue-lacquered armor; she'd appeared at their
camp...
<p>
Bulma remembered now.  She, Trunks and Goten had been waiting the
outcome of Gohan and Raditz's raid when the woman in blue samurai
armour appeared out of nowhere.
<p>
She simply said, "The Opawang desires your presence," and breathed
out a strange mist that swiftly enveloped them. Bulma couldn't
remember anything after that.
<p>
Bulma looked around. "Trunks, where's Goten?" She couldn't keep the
fear out of her voice.
<p>
Trunks looked at the floor. "I don't know. He wasn't here when I
woke up."
<p>
Bulma struggled to her feet and confronted the blue samurai
woman. "What did you creeps do with Goten?  Where's the baby?"
<p>
The woman looked at her impassively.  "He is the Opawang's hostage, as
are you, that the others with you might learn good manners and
obedience."
<p>
Bulma thought briefly of Gohan--good kid, but tendency to berserk--
and Raditz-- pure Saiyan ferocity and temper. "Raditz, learn manners?
We're dead. We're all dead."  A look of cold determination settled
across her face.
<p>
In one sudden move, she slapped the samurai woman across the face, as
hard as she could, and screamed. "TRUNKS, HELP ME KILL THIS BITCH!"
<p>
Trunks leaped across the room and smashed into the armored woman's
right knee, toppling her to the floor. Bulma kicked her in the face,
which didn't appear to damage her anymore than her slap had.
<p>
"Don't let her breathe that mist! That's what put us to sleep before!"
Bulma kicked her again in the mouth; the samurai woman rolled and
crouched on one knee. She inhaled--
<p>
Trunks hit her hard in the solar plexis, slamming her into the silk
wall hangings and the stone wall behind them. She gagged and
choked. Trunks seized energy and hurled it, pinning the blue-armored
woman to the wall in a blast of ki.  The back-blast filled most of the
room.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz settled beside Gohan, still watching the Opawang. "When this is
all over," he muttered to Gohan, "I am going to take great pleasure in
telling that fool woman 'I told you so'."
<p>
The Opawang's voice rang out. "You still don't know what you are
dealing with, my pretty innocents.  You, the tall one," he pointed one
long lacquered nail at Raditz, "do you really think you are any more
dangerous as a mortal than you were as a ghost? Pathetic, deluded
fool!  You have some power, as does this child, but it matters
not. You could have all the power in the world, it would not suffice."
<p>
"If you're such a bad boy," Raditz challenged, "why do you need a baby
to shield yourself?"
<p>
"Raditz!" Gohan whispered. "Something's wrong! Can you sense ki?"
<p>
"I don't know, I've never tried--not in this world. If it's like
sensing spirits in the otherworld--perhaps. I'll try it sometime."
Raditz whispered back.
<p>
Gohan continued quickly. "I can't sense anybody up there besides the
Opawang and Goten--but I can sense Bulma and Trunks off to the
northwest--not here!"
<p>
The Opawang answered. "I would let you test your strength against me,
that you might know the futility of it and despair, but you are
indiscriminately destructive--and I find rebuilding my residence an
annoying waste of power and time. I curb your destructiveness with the
knowledge that you might destroy those you protect."
<p>
He continued, "Count yourself blessed, for rare indeed is it that I
make the same offer twice! But your woman has set me free and restored
my servants and my stronghold to power; let it not be said that the
Opawang is ungrateful! Serve me, you, the child and the others, and
you will reap rewards beyond your comprehension!"
<p>
Raditz whispered back to Gohan, "So the two Ochimo with Bulma and
Trunks are just holograms of some kind? Yeah, then all we have to do
is get Goten away from Hornhead there." He smirked, and continued,
"The bastards have surprise defenses and odd powers, but once you get
past those, they're weak--and their attacks are pathetic.  We've got
speed on them, too. I'll hit Hornhead, you grab Goten.  Any surprises,
I'll try to deal with them, your number one goal is to rescue the
kid. Do what you have to, don't get diverted, and I can be a lot freer
in dealing with surprises if I don't have to worry about Goten. Got
it?"
<p>
Gohan nodded abruptly. "Yes!"
<p>
"Well?" called the Opawang. "It isn't that difficult a decision--" He
broke off, looking northwest. "By the Dark Serpent! How can a mere
child--"
<p>
Raditz slammed into the Opawang--and nearly broke his shoulder. A
stone wall would have been softer. Gohan grabbed for Goten, only to
see Goten and the Opawang disappear out from under his grasp.
<p>
The Opawang reappeared about fifty feet above them. "You want the
child? Take him!" He hurled Goten down with tremendous force; Gohan
swerved to catch him. "MIT-TEN EM TEKAU PEST!"  He hurled a sphere of
white power from his hand; it branched into nine seething balls of
energy hurtling towards the three saiyajin.
<p>
Gohan snatched Goten in midair and hurled himself sideways. "Raditz,
LOOK OUT!" He sheltered his kid brother with his body as he blew
through the side of the keep and out of the path of the spheres.
<p>
Warned by Gohan's shout, Raditz threw his hands up in a full ki-block;
the spheres slammed into it and slammed him into the floor.  The
floor broke beneath him as he held onto the block with all his will;
he fell further into a subterranean chamber and smashed into the
ground. The titanic forces he fought to hold off crushed him into the
earth; no further retreat possible.  His block broke, and the spheres
exploded.
<p>
WHOOOOM-WHOOOM-WHOOOM-WH-WH-WHOOOM-WHOOOM-WH-WHOOOM! Nine tremendous
detonations almost at once deafened Gohan. A great cloud of smoke and
ash billowed up, hiding the former keep.
<p>
Gohan looked around, senses aware. The Opawang had vanished--ah,
there! To the northwest, near Bulma and Trunks. Not good. What about
Raditz? Had he survived?  Gohan couldn't sense him at first.  Finally,
he sensed Raditz, far below, and very weak.  Still alive!
<p>
Goten wriggled. "Hey! Don' like noise. Head hurt!" he whined.
<p>
Gohan sighed with relief. His little brother was okay. "Hold still,
silly! I don't want to drop you! I don't like the noise either."
<p>
The smoke cloud finally cleared to reveal a gaping crater where the
keep used to be.  The pool was gone, too, vaporized by the heat of the
blasts.  At the very bottom of the crater, Raditz sprawled unmoving.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Trunks was standing, fists clenched, over the smoking body of the
samurai woman when the Opawang appeared. Bulma sat on the floor,
looking dazed and a bit singed around the edges. The Opawang
backhanded Trunks with one long-nailed hand, sending him flying across
the room. Trunks snapped an arm out, caught the wall, and rebounded,
landing lightly on his feet facing the Opawang.  Blood ran down his
cheek from four parallel cuts.
<p>
"What manner of creature are you, that a mere boy can kill one of my
Ochimo?" The Opawang marvelled.
<p>
Bulma glanced at the blue-armored body on the floor. "She was--the
Blue Ochimo? The Ochimo of Air?  And I actually slapped her?? Oh boy."
She turned white, and then red with anger. "That bitch tried to kill
me last night!"
<p>
Trunks glared at the Opawang, his face set, an angry light in his
eyes. Something about his stance reminded Bulma of his father... and
then he spoke.
<p>
"I am Trunks Vegeta Briefs, royal son of Prince Vegeta of Vegetasai,
first and only son of King Vegeta of Vegetasai, ruler of the greatest
race of warriors the universe has ever known. Who are you, dog?"
<p>
The Opawang regarded him silently for long moments.  "Boast not
overmuch of your lineage, princeling.  Born I was a prince of the
royal house of ancient Khem, raised up an Adept of Thoth--but by mine
own eye and heart and hand I have surpassed my fathers and their
father's fathers. I alone dared read the Three Sacred Books of Thoth,
and master the secrets of immortality; I alone delved into secrets of
elder Stygia and sought out the Iron-bound Book of Skelos, lost in
this distant land, that made me master of demons and spirits; I alone
summoned the Child of Chaos from the Time Before Time and pacted with
it for the secrets of power without limit.  What matters your warrior
race?  Time will make them dust, whilst I--Ah! I see in your mind--thy
noble race is extinct already, destroyed in a world's cataclysm, and
your royal father is dead as well.  Only the tall one I slew outside,
the youth, the babe and another--Kakarott? Goku?--still survive."  The
Opawang laughed, cruel and mocking.
<p>
"So it goes with all my enemies who have ever been or ever will
be--even if I slay them not myself, still Time will bring them to the
grave, whilst I remain, immortal and invulnerable."  He glanced at
Bulma, who was holding Trunks tightly and fearfully. "Do you pretty
innocents finally understand?  I cannot be harmed, and I will not die,
there is no limit to my power, and you cannot escape me even in
death. Thy souls are mine for the taking."
<p>
Then the wall shattered.
<p>

<p>
"Nunk Rats? Nunk Rats hurt?  NUNK RATS, WAKE UP! PLEASE!"
<p>
Raditz groaned and forced his eyes open.  He blinked, trying to focus
on whatever was blocking his view of the sky.  Everything hurt.  He
was still alive.
<p>
After a few minutes, Raditz finally managed to bring things into focus.
He was lying flat on his back at the bottom of a deep crater, and
Goten was leaning over him, looking scared and worried.
<p>
"Nunk Rats?" Goten asked hopefully. His eyes were red and suspiciously
wet.
<p>
"Yeah, kid, I'm still here." Remind me not to die in front of the
kid. With his ability to see spirits--particularly mine--it would
confuse the hell out of him.
<p>
Raditz carefully hauled himself to a sitting position, and spat out a
mouthful of blood. He looked himself over.
<p>
No broken bones, lots of minor cuts, major bruises, a bloody nose, and
I feel like an ezwal has been using me for a trampoline--and my armor
looks like it, too--but other than that, I'm in pretty good shape for
someone who should be dead.  I must have come back to life a lot
stronger than I was before--the Opawang's attack was easily twice as
powerful as that blast of Piccolo's that killed me--maybe more.
Heh. Maybe eight years in Hell was good for something besides moral
re-calibration.
<p>
Now, what's Goten doing here? And where's everyone else? Well, I said
I'd try it...
<p>
Raditz pulled Goten onto his lap, and held him while he calmed himself
and the child. Clearing his mind, listening but not with his ears,
looking but not with his eyes, aware...
<p>
There! Two great powers, one bright, one dark as a demon's heart--this
is like sensing spirits, it's the same thing!--one lesser but strong
and bright--Trunks?--another lesser, dark, fairly distant, another
close by, moving closer--!
<p>
Raditz snapped his head around. The Earth Ochimo was sliding down the
crater wall towards them, blade in hand!  Raditz swept Goten up to his
shoulder and lept to his feet in one motion. "Hang on tight, kid. It's
about to get wild!"
<p>
Goten grabbed tight hold of his uncle's hair; Raditz started to power
up.  The Ochimo of Earth hesitated as the ground began to shake, and
dust and small stones rose into the air.  Energy crackled around
Raditz and Goten; the veins stood out on his forehead. Suddenly the
chaos stopped as Raditz pulled in the gathered power.
<p>
The Ochimo mistook the sudden calm for weakness, and attacked with a
mighty kiai-shout! The blade hissed through the air, but Raditz was
not there. From behind, he cracked his fist into the Ochimo's lower
back--a back as hard and strong as stone, but Raditz's blow would have
shattered granite.  It shattered the Ochimo's spine--and then, as if
time had rolled backwards, Raditz felt the Ochimo's back unshatter
itself underneath his hand, and then the Ochimo was flung forward by
the force of his blow.
<p>
"What the HELL?" Raditz stared at his staggered opponent; the Earth
Ochimo had been thrown to his knees and was rising to his feet.  "I
know I hit you and HURT you, I felt it! But the damage I did undid
itself like it never was--how?"
<p>
"Foolish mortal! We are part of our master, he is part of us. To harm
us is to harm our master, and he cannot be harmed!" The Earth Ochimo's
voice was deep, like ancient rocks groaning.
<p>
"You're not as tough as you'd like me to think," Raditz snarled. "I've
already killed one of you." Something clicked in his mind.  His first
few attacks on the Fire Ochimo had done no damage--and Gohan's attack
on the Earth Ochimo hadn't done much more than toss him off the
battlefield.  Yet, he had killed the Fire Ochimo later.. Raditz smiled
evilly.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Bulma gasped as Gohan drifted deliberately through the gaping hole in
the wall. White-hot energies crackled and seethed around him. He
settled to the floor beside Trunks.
<p>
"Trunks, get your mother out of here!" He turned to face the
Opawang. "You can leave, now." His voice was deceptively quiet; to
Bulma, it seemed like Goku himself stood there.
<p>
"Leave? Bold youth, why should I wish to leave when you have brought
such a fine feast to my table?  What a pretty innocent you are!" The
Opawang smiled--and suddenly shuddered, as if in pain. He
snarled. "MIT-ET EM SES HAUT!" he flung out his hand, and a ball of
tangled, jagged black, white and red lightnings formed and roiled
through the air towards Gohan.
<p>
Trunks tackled his mother and threw her flat as Gohan threw up a hand
to deflect it. Almost too late, he realized that the thing was not a
ki-construct, and dodged out of its path.  It swung wide, and swerved
to follow him, gouging a deep grove in the stone wall as it brushed
against it.
<p>
Gohan retreated out the hole in the wall, to the open air; the
black and red ball of destruction followed.  He cupped power in his
hand, and flung it at the destroying thing.
<p>
KAK-BLAAM! With an ugly cracking sound, the thing exploded. Gohan
threw himself back into the room; the Opawang looked slightly
disappointed. Gohan grabbed Trunks and Bulma, and flew back out of the
room; where to now?  He looked down as light flared below him, and a
power died; as the dust cleared, he saw Raditz rising toward him,
Goten clinging to his neck. Far below, smoking bits of samurai armor
lay scattered about a secondary crater.
<p>
The Opawang stepped through the hole in the wall and hovered. "I do
not permit you to leave!" He raised his hand, and pointed at
Gohan. "MIT--"
<p>
"Raditz, catch!" Gohan dropped Bulma and Trunks and raised his own
hands. "KA-"
<p>
"Eeeeeeee!" Bulma screamed as she fell.
<p>
"-ET--" the sorceror shouted.
<p>
"ME--" The wave began to build...
<p>
"EM--" the horns on the Opawang's head glowed.
<p>
"HA--" The wave was building...
<p>
"BES--" Fire began to glow at the horned sorceror's fingertips. Raditz
caught Bulma and Trunks. Bulma looked very surprised.
<p>
"ME-HA!" The universe turned white and black as the actinic white power
blazed from Gohan's hands.  The blast enveloped the sorceror--
<p>
something black billowed around him--
<p>
--and the universe returned to normal as Gohan's Ka-meha-meha wave
vanished, blinking out as if at the flip of a light switch.
<p>
The Opawang laughed, mocking; twin crystal horns glowed bright as
stars.

<hr>
<H1><A NAME="Des">XI. DESPERATION</A></H1>
<p>
Raditz's eyes went wide with shock. "Oh, crud! He's a damn energy
vampire! GOHAN, DUCK!"
<p>
"MIT-TEN EM TEKAU PEST!" Once again, nine spheres of blazing energy
hurtled toward Gohan and Raditz. Raditz darted out of the path of
destruction, and sped across the valley, looking for a safer place to
deposit Bulma, Trunks and Goten. A small mountainside shrine caught
his eye. Behind him, Gohan did not duck.
<p>
Raditz glanced back as he hastily dropped Bulma and the kids at the
shrine.  Gohan blocked AND DEFLECTED the explosive spheres, one after
another, almost faster than Raditz could follow. One-two-three, four,
five, six-seven-eight-nine, the fiery spheres rebounded and flashed
past the Opawang to detonate thunderously against the west rampart of
the fortress.
<p>
Gohan hovered in mid-air, unscathed, facing the Opawang.  Only the
eastern walls of the fortress still stood; the rest was a row of
smoking craters.  Gohan's hair blazed golden. The Opawang glowed; a
fiery nimbus surrounded him.
<p>
I knew the kid was more powerful than I, but this! I never
suspected...  My god, I'm totally outclassed here! I'm nothing, next
to this.  I'm a first-class Saiyan warrior, but I might as well be one
of those villagers, for all that my power matters next to these
two! Wait a second, that flame nimbus looks familiar...
<p>
Gohan struck. Faster than even Raditz's eye could follow, he closed
with the Opawang, hammering him with mountain-shattering blows--only
to fall away, screaming in pain, burnt and bleeding. The Opawang
hurtled back, slammed into the mountainside by the force of Gohan's blows.
<p>
"GOHAN! NO!" Raditz screamed. He hurtled down and caught Gohan's
falling body with one arm; with the other, he threw a blast of ki--not
at the Opawang, but at the mountainside above the Opawang.  The
Opawang picked himself up just in time for several hundred tons of
rock to fall on his head.
<p>
"That'll slow him down for a few." Raditz carried Gohan to the small
shrine where the others waited.  "You with us, kid?"
<p>
"Yep, just.. hurting," Gohan gasped. His hair faded back to
black. "What happened?"
<p>
"Same thing that happened when I hit the Fire Ochimo--that flame aura
somehow turns your own attack against you." Raditz shook his
head. "You attacked before I could warn you. Looked like you hit
yourself hard."
<p>
"Oh, man, did I!" Gohan groaned. "What is that guy, anyway?"
<p>
"An immortal sorceror of ancient..." Bulma played with her pocket
comp, muttering under her breath, "Egypt?  Khem is Egypt?  What on
earth is an ancient Egyptian sorceror doing HERE?" She looked everyone
over.
<p>
Goten and Trunks looked fine, except for a little dust in their
hair. Gohan grimaced in pain, and his gi was torn and burnt; his arms
looked blistered and sore.  Raditz looked like an elephant herd had
trampled him a few times--his armor was crazed and cracked, the one
remaining shoulder piece had been blown off entirely, and the leg
guards broken off short. Dried blood streaked his face and limbs, and
his right arm was blistered like Gohan's.
<p>
"He likes the climate?" Raditz offered. "All I know is what I've
seen--the sonuvabitch is an energy vampire--he eats ki attacks and
absorbs their power for himself--and he has some weird defenses and
some dangerous attacks. Gohan, forget what I said about their attacks
being pathetic--he damn near killed me with that Nine Sphere blast of
his!"
<p>
"I know--I saw. For a while, I thought he did. Kill you, I mean."
Gohan looked thoughtful.
<p>
Raditz blinked. I must be imagining things--it sounds like the idea
bothered him. Could it have?
<p>
"What the Opawang said," Bulma interjected, "was that he was immortal,
couldn't be harmed, had unlimited power, and could control spirits and
demons--even the dead. A very arrogant and nasty person to be stuck in
the same room with." She looked wonderingly at her son.  "Trunks, that
challenge you made to the Opawang--where did that come from?"
<p>
Trunks blushed and ducked his head. "Mom, I was really, really scared
when the Opawang appeared like that..." Trunks stared at his feet for
a moment, "..and I wondered, 'What would Father do? <i>He</i> wouldn't be
scared!'" A fierce expression flashed across his face as Trunks
clenched his small fists. "I pretended I was Father, and I wasn't
scared anymore."
<p>
Bulma laughed nervously.  "You sounded so much like your father it
scared <i>me</i>."
<p>
Raditz rolled his eyes. "Yeah, well, while we're thinking like Vegeta,
let's answer this question: how do we kill the bastard?"
<p>
Bulma bit her lip. "He's immortal and invulnerable--"
<p>
"You are as bad as my brother.  Do you really believe everything your
ENEMY tells you?" Raditz looked disgusted. "Come on, woman, pull it
together and use your head."
<p>
Bulma glared at him. "You can be really annoying, you know?"
<p>
"It's a natural talent of mine. In less than ten minutes I can talk
people into killing me without even trying to. Just ask Kakarott."
<p>
She snarled through clenched teeth. "I'm about ready to kill you
myself! CAN WE GET BACK TO THE POINT??"
<p>
"The point is, Opie there said a lot of crap about himself, but we
don't know how much of that is true, and how much is pure bullshit
intended to spook us.  I shouldn't have to tell you this, you're not
stupid." Raditz looked mildly contemptuous.
<p>
Bulma looked very annoyed. "Oh yeah? Gohan," she turned to him, "you
tell me--what's he got?"
<p>
Gohan looked thoughtful. "He has some nasty defenses, some moderately
dangerous attacks--nothing I shouldn't be able to handle with the
proper precautions--but I couldn't hurt him.  I hit him, Bulma, I
smashed him into the mountain with super-saiyan strength--and his
power didn't weaken in the least.  Raditz dropped a chunk of mountain
on his head, and he's still there, just as tough.  No change in his
strength--except one: it went UP when I blasted him with a
Kamehameha. Raditz is right about that--he consumes energy thrown at
him." He shook his head. "I don't know how to explain it, unless part
of what he says is true--if he is immortal."
<p>
Bulma looked at Raditz. "Got a theory, Raditz?"
<p>
"Nope, just a few points.  One bad, one maybe useful.  Don't get in a
panic, but some of the crap Opie was spewing was true. He does have
power over ghosts and spirits--remember I told you I nearly didn't get
away from him when I was a ghost? He can trap souls and drain their
energy--and he's somehow keeping spirits from leaving this
valley. Dying here and now would be bad--above and beyond the usual
unpleasantness." He shifted his position.
<p>
"Bet that the Ochimo we killed will be back by nightfall, at least as
the demon spirits they were before you wished them all back. Not good;
anyone here know how fight a soul-stealing wraith that you can't even
touch? Didn't think so. I'll get back to that--I have some ideas."
<p>
Bulma and Gohan both glanced at the lowering western sun, and looked
at each other. Bulma swallowed nervously. "Let's get back to that real
soon," she muttered.
<p>
Raditz stood up and paced. "The one maybe useful point is a question:
if there is something to what he was saying, exactly what makes this
guy immortal and what makes him invulnerable?"
<p>
Bulma pondered, brow furrowed. "Okay, tell me if we're on the same
page: something gives this guy unlimited ability to absorb abuse, what
is it?  You're right, he didn't just wake up one morning and decide to
be immortal--he did something, and something in him is changed from a
normal person. But what?"
<p>
Gohan thought a bit. "His ability to absorb ki and throw it back as
more attacks, or bolster his own defenses could be enough to make him
practically invulnerable.."
<p>
Raditz frowned. "He sucks up physical damage, too. I hit him,
physically, and nearly broke bones--mine. I saw you hit him, and that
nasty fire shield of his may turn your attack against you, but it
doesn't stop the physical impact from getting through.  He slammed
into that mountain HARD. Of course, if he can channel stolen ki into
some kind of healing ability..."  Raditz stopped short.
<p>
"Of course." He turned to Gohan. "When you were up there in the room
with him and Bulma and Trunks, did you see any sign that he was losing
energy, or in pain, or even distracted?"
<p>
Gohan looked startled.  "Yes. Yes, I did. When I faced the Opawang, he
was boasting one moment, then a spasm hit him, and he started trying
to kill me."
<p>
Raditz grinned. "THAT was when I broke the Earth Ochimo's back--and it
healed immediately.  I FELT it heal under my hand. The Ochimo said
something about it and its master being part of each other--to harm it
was to harm Opie, and Opie couldn't be harmed, or some such crap. The
Ochimo are tied to him; he can lend some limited part of his ability
to take abuse to them, and they feed him energy--or they did as
ghosts, anyway."
<p>
Trunks spoke up. "When I attacked the Air Ochimo, I couldn't hurt her
at first--but when I powered up and started really pouring energy into
my attacks, she went down fast--almost as if she had no defenses at
all."
<p>
Raditz nodded. "It went the same way with the Fire and Earth
Ochimo. Their invulnerablity is a lot more limited than Opie's, but it
may be the same kind--some rapid self-healing sort of thing--but they
had to draw the power from Opie, and he doesn't strike me as the
generous type."
<p>
Bulma pursed her lips. "Hmmmm... So he can absorb ki and take no
damage from it, he can heal himself from physical damage, and he can
use ki to make additional defenses and attacks. He can control ghosts,
or at least drain ki from them. So how do we kill this bastard?"
<p>
"The safe way of dealing with an energy vampire," Raditz commented,
"is to starve it--don't feed it energy yourself, cut it off from its
usual methods of feeding, force it to expend energy, and then, when it
is weaker, finish it with purely physical attacks or the next best
thing. The unsafe, quick and dirty way of dealing with an energy
vampire is to overload it, dump so much energy into it so fast that it
can't keep up with the energy, and so dies. It can be embarrassing if
the vamp doesn't overload. Heh."
<p>
Raditz looked back up at the ruined fortress. "Too bad Gohan fed the
bastard more energy than he could dream of stealing from a whole
planetful of weak humans. We can't starve him, I doubt he
overloads--he didn't seem bothered by Gohan's big blast--and it's
going to tricky to make him use up energy without accidently feeding
him some more.  It's the only thing I can think of right now--push him
hard, make him burn energy, and hope we can find some weakness." He
shook his head. "It's not much of a plan."
<p>
Bulma looked for some hope. "What about our original plan, to free the
kami of the spring? We could at least get away, then."
<p>
Gohan looked up. "No. He won't let us go that easily; we're too
valuable a prize for him, and too dangerous as enemies.  That would
have worked while he was still imprisoned, but now.." Goku's son shook
his head.  "Besides, I won't leave a monster like that running loose
to do who knows what to however many innocent people."
<p>
Bulma's shoulders drooped.  "You're not inspiring a lot of confidence,
guys. This isn't looking good, is it?"
<p>
Raditz regarded her impassively; he glanced at Gohan. "Sorry, I don't
believe in comforting lies." He stood up. "Listen! If we don't beat
this bastard, and any of you survive, and the kami is freed or
Hornhead brings down the barriers for his own reasons, WARN KAKAROTT!
Don't let him walk unaware into that bastard's traps--letting Hornhead
feed on Kakarott's power would be.. bad."
<p>
Gohan looked at the setting sun. "*Ahem* About fighting with
soul-stealing wraiths..."
<p>
"Yeah, I guess that's our next worry--at least as long as Opie is
digging himself out from under all that rock.  I need to work
something out--an idea I had--give me a while..." Raditz sat down and
closed his eyes, as if in meditation.
<p>
Bulma frowned, and shrugged. "Well, Gohan, while he's doing that,
let's see if I can dig up any food for the kids." She looked through
her capsule case and started opening things up and digging out
packages.  "Goten's already sacked out, and Trunks looks tired. Ah,
here's some sleeping bags, and here's the camp food!"
<p>

<p>
I fought them easily enough as a spirit among spirits.  And what am I
now? Spirit clothed in flesh, but the spirit is still there. I should
still be able to fight them, but how do I see them, and what weapon do
I use?
<p>
Seeing is easy--they manifest visibly to attack the living, and
unmanifested they are nothing, a nuisance in dreams, no more. But
where is the weapon I used?
<p>
There is no steel nor armor plate in the spirit realm--all things are
spirit, even what seem to be tangible objects. My blade was not a
thing, but an idea, a concept of an attack that gives the opponent no
hold on one's spirit, no passion to inflame, no weakness to tear
at. It is the passionless strike, the blow without hate, destruction
without anger, the act without doubt, the purpose that is true. It is
the void, and the flame within. Set aside the Saiyan battle rage; it
gives no strength here.  Remember the purpose -- protect them!
<p>
It is manifest.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz opened his eyes. Across his lap lay a spectral, translucent
white katana. It had no weight; he grasped the hilt with his right
hand, seemingly, but it had no substance. Only in spirit could he feel
it; it was a thing of pure spirit. Invisible, save for the ki-glow he
had given it to guide his stroke.  He raised the spirit blade in
salute. "To you, Bardock my father, for what you have taught me. May
it be enough."
<p>
It was full dark; someone had kindled a campfire, and Trunks watched
him from across that fire, thoughtful. Bulma and Goten slept; Gohan
also watched, open-mouthed with astonishment. "What is that?"
<p>
"A weapon--the same weapon I used last night on those same wraiths. I
just had to figure out how to recall it." Raditz sighed, and the blade
vanished like morning mist in the sun. "Don't worry, it'll be there
when I need it." He smiled, and the blade reappeared in his left hand,
flickered, and vanished.  "If I keep my soul in the right place."
<p>
Trunks regarded him intently. "'Remember the purpose'" he quoted, "I
understand that, but what is the 'flame in the void'? Can you teach me
to create such a weapon?"
<p>
"Was I speaking aloud?" Raditz looked at Trunks thoughtfully.
<p>
Gohan looked bewildered. "I heard nothing."
<p>
"I'm not sure you were. I may have heard your mind." Trunks said.
<p>
Something is happening here.. He should not have heard me. Perhaps he
was.. meant to?  The blade reappeared in Raditz's hand. He presented
it, hilt first, to Trunks.
<p>
Trunks took it.  He held the spirit blade, scarely daring to
breathe. Wonder and awe shown on his face. "How did--?" The blade
flickered and vanished.
<p>
"Careful. You let yourself get too excited. It's still there, just
take hold of it.. with your spirit. Remember what you heard in my
mind..."
<p>
Trunks centered himself, and found the void, emptied of all passion
and concern. Within, the flame, and he seized hold of it--lightly, for
a flame is not held with force. The blade re-appeared in Trunks' hand,
shaped like a straight sword, not a katana this time.
<p>
He looked at Raditz, wonder and a profound respect in his eyes. "But
you.. have no weapon now."
<p>
Raditz smirked. "Not so." The ghost katana reappeared in his right
hand; Trunks still held his spirit sword. "That's the funny thing
about spirit; it increases when you give it away."
<p>
Gohan looked on in amazement. He really is Dad's brother, like him,
and not like him in the oddest ways. He's the dark to Dad's
light--like Vegeta! That strangeness I see in his eyes--when I catch
an unguarded look at Goten, Trunks, Bulma, even myself-- I remember
catching a glimpse of it in Vegeta's eyes, way back on Namek, when he
thought I didn't see him watching me.  It was so out of place in the
person I believed Vegeta to be, that I didn't believe what I saw
then--not until so much later, when I came to know Vegeta as he truly
is.  Is it really so hard for a Saiyan to admit he has a heart?
<p>

<p>
The ghost Ochimo attacked at midnight.  As if in some ghastly reprise
of their deaths, the Fire and Earth Ochimo attacked Raditz, while the
Air Ochimo slipped past him to pursue Trunks.  Perhaps they thought to
take vengeance; they did not say, and Raditz did not ask.
<p>
Spectral weapons clashed without sound; Earth hesitated as Fire
pressed the attack. Beyond them, Air circled Trunks warily, more
cautious now that her opponent was armed, not the defenseless victim
she had expected.  Gohan tested his powers, only to find to his dismay
that ki blasts merely passed through the intangible spirits without
touching them.
<p>
Earth broke away from the contest between Fire and Raditz to pursue
the defenseless Gohan. Raditz grinned evilly; how convenient of Earth
to expose himself!  He feinted at Fire, and before Fire could do more
than parry, in a blur of speed Raditz was on the Earth Ochimo. The
spirit blade sliced him across and through; the maimed ghost fled with
a dismal wail.  Raditz spun and beheaded Fire, who'd leaped to attack
his apparently unguarded back.
<p>
A third wail marked the passing of Air; Trunks flourished his blade
and saluted Raditz. "You're right--we have speed and they have skill."
<p>
"Which is why we wrapped this fight up as fast as possible." Raditz
dispelled his spirit blade. "I'd feel better if I knew what Water was
up to. He's the one we never accounted for."
<p>
Gohan looked up the mountain, into the darkness. "I'd feel better
knowing what the Opawang is up to."
<p>
"Sending those creeps after us, for one thing. They came down on us
about five minutes after he got loose from all that rock."
<p>
Gohan glanced sharply at Raditz. "You sensed it, too? Why didn't you
say anything?"
<p>
"I don't believe in comforting lies, but I do know when to keep my
mouth shut. As long as Hornhead's staying up there, and not doing
anything to us, we might as well get some rest. We'll need it later."
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Dawn came red and gloomy; black clouds still hovered over the
valley. Bulma was the first to wake (save Raditz, who hadn't slept);
she stretched, got up, looked around--and screamed.
<p>
Bulma's scream woke everyone up. "What? What's wrong?" Gohan looked
around, and finally saw what Bulma was pointing at with one trembling
hand. His eyes went wide with shock.
<p>
The Opawang's fortress stood, frowning upon the mountainside. It
reared proud and undamaged, as if yesterday's battle had never been.
<p>
"Now we know what Hornhead was doing last night," Raditz said
dryly. "He likes having a clean house more than he likes chasing us in
the dark."
<p>
"What kind of power does he have, that he can just rebuild a castle in
one night?" Gohan sounded almost scared.
<p>
"Hopefully, less than he had yesterday," Raditz responded. "If he
doesn't..."
<p>
"Oh, no!" Bulma was looking downhill now, at the village. "Where are
all the people? Nothing is moving--even the pigs and chickens are
quiet."
<p>
Raditz scowled. "Maybe it's just my nasty, suspicious mind--but I
think I know what the Water Ochimo was up to.  Time to find that
bastard. Gohan, protect Bulma."  Power flared around Raditz, and he
took to the air.
<p>
Behind him, Bulma packed up the camp gear and popped the scooter
capsule. "Gohan, you carry Goten. I'm riding the scooter, Trunks you
hang on behind me."
<p>
"What? Where are we going?"
<p>
"Back to the spring. I have some important questions to ask of Black
Earth River Daughter, questions whose answers just might save our
bacon." Bulma had that "I will not even listen to any arguments, so
don't bother" look on her face; Gohan wisely quelled his protests.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz found the Ochimo of Water at the spring, claiming his last
victim.  The farm girl who had been resurrected with him there
sprawled face down, unmoving. The Water Ochimo snarled at him, and
pointed a gauntleted hand; water surged out of the spring to envelop
Raditz, forcing itself into his nose and mouth, choking him.
<p>
He refused to panic, and summoned power, forcing the animated water
away and off of him. Raditz coughed out stray drops of water. "Nice try,
but not good enough. Fool."
<p>
A familiar nimbus of cold blue flame surrounded the Water Ochimo.
Raditz grinned evilly. "You guys like that trick, don't you? Too bad
I'm on to it." He rose back into the air, gathered power in each hand,
and slammed two ki-blasts into the Ochimo.
<p>
The Ochimo was tossed backwards by the blasts, and his nimbus of fire
fluttered and went out.  The green samurai rose to his feet,
apparently undamaged.
<p>
"I know that trick, too," said Raditz.  He rocketed down and into the
Ochimo, brutally plunging his hand through armor, skin and bone.  With
his hand deep in the Ochimo's chest, Raditz cut loose with another
powerful blast.  An instant later, he flung the mangled, charred
corpse down the mountainside.
<p>
"Thank you, Zarbon, for telling me how Vegeta took you out. It came in
handy." Raditz spoke quietly, only for the wind to hear.  He turned to
look at the fortress. "Old Hornhead didn't like that, did he?"
<p>
Raditz saw Gohan approaching.  "GOHAN! Give the kid to Bulma and
intercept the Opawang! I killed his last Ochimo, and he's really
pissed off!"
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
The Opawang stood on air, his face dark with wrath. A nimbus of purple
flame crackled around him; his crystal horns glowed bright as
stars. "Enough of this! This day, you die.  MIT-ET EM TEHEN!"
<p>
Lightning cracked from the Opawang's fingers to Gohan's golden-haired,
glowing form. He didn't even bother to raise a warding hand, but took
the lightning bolt square in the chest.  He didn't even blink.
<p>
A great boulder rose from the ground, circled Gohan's head, and flung
itself at the Opawang faster than even Raditz's eye could follow.  The
Opawang never had a chance to move.  The boulder smashed into him,
flinging him back and into the mountainside, and shattered into a
cloud of dust.
<p>
"Yep, he felt that.  Feel his power bobble a bit when you hit him?"
Raditz gestured with one hand; several smaller boulders rose and
circled him. The dust cleared to reveal the Opawang, even angrier if
that were possible, his flame nimbus still intact. Raditz flicked his
hand; half a dozen small boulders slammed into the Opawang, one after
another.
<p>
The nimbus went out; Gohan charged.  With his full Super-Saiyan
strength, he hit the Opawang, smashing his jaw, breaking his back,
slamming an elbow into his gut, and flinging him to the ground with
enough force to embed him in the rock ten feet deep. "That's got him!"
<p>
"No!" Raditz turned his head. The Opawang appeared in mid-air, several
hundred feet away.  He appeared unhurt; a shimmering, translucent
sphere surrounded him.  The flame nimbus re-appeared.
<p>
"His power is down--a tiny bit. At this rate, it'll take forever, and
he's not going to fall for the same trick twice." Raditz frowned.
<p>
Gohan summoned another huge boulder and flung it at the Opawang, only
to watch it swerve around the sphere and crash harmlessly into the
mountain. "Not good. Next trick?"
<p>
"Try it, kid. Just don't touch that damn flame shield!"
<p>
Gohan dove into the fortress and tore loose a huge roof beam, and then
smashed it down on the Opawang (who still couldn't dodge the
Saiyans).  Once again, after two or three blows, the flame nimbus went
out, and Gohan rained mountain-shattering blows down on the Opawang.
Once again, it seemed the Opawang was near death--and he vanished only
to re-appear elsewhere.
<p>
"Raditz, I swear his power was nearly gone, but now it's back almost
full again!"
<p>
"I know, he's got a reserve he's pulling in from somewhere--but where?
LOOK OUT!" Raditz dodged back, almost to the village, as the Opawang
flung fire in their direction. Gohan contemptuously deflected it
straight back to its origin.  The fire bolt swerved around the
shimmering sphere and splashed against the mountainside.
<p>
"I tire of this game! Your heart's hearts are mine!" snarled the
Opawang, and vanished again.
<p>
"I hate that teleport trick of his. Where'd he get to--NOOOO!"
Raditz screamed. The Opawang was below him, at the spring--with Bulma
and Trunks and Goten. Raditz dove.
<p>
Gohan cried out in horror, and moved with all his Super-Saiyan speed,
but he knew he would be too late. He could already hear the spell.
<p>
"TAA-T AB-KEH!" Bulma stood, frozen with terror, knowing that the
Opawang spoke her death.  He stood on air above her, one long-nailed
hand extended, evil triumph on his face.
<p>
Then Raditz flung her aside and leaped toward the Opawang, between her
and that outstretched, taloned hand.  She hit the boulder wall, and
lay stunned from the impact. Blood splashed over her, and she dimly
heard a cry of agony--and then something glowing golden flashed across
her sight and the Opawang was gone far away.

<hr>
<H1><A NAME="End">XII. BATTLE'S END</A></H1>
<p>
Time seemed to stand still as Raditz flung himself at the Opawang. I
can't see the spell, he thought. Then something insubstantial slipped
through his defenses, past his armor and skin and bone to grip his
heart.  The insubstantial became adamantine knives, and Raditz
screamed as he felt his heart rip out of his chest, tearing bone and
skin and armor apart.
<p>
His vision shifted as his power faded and he fell. Raditz saw the
Opawang as he appeared in both this world and the next, all at
once--and he understood.  Gohan, flashing with golden power, smashed
into the Opawang and flung him far, far away as Raditz's dying body
crashed to earth.
<p>
Trunks was the first one to reach Raditz. His face was white with
horror. "MOM! Help me, Raditz is hurt bad!"  Bulma groaned, still
stunned from her rough rescue.
<p>
Blood flooded the pavement; Raditz reached up and grabbed Trunks'
vest. "No time.. I'm dying. Listen!..  I've seen.. his weakness.. Tell
Gohan.. to push.. him.. harder.."  Raditz spat blood.  "Weakness.. is
in the spirit.. realm.  Opie can't.. defend.. himself.. both
realms.. same.. time."  Raditz's grip relaxed, and his arm fell.  "I
will.. take him out.. on.. the.. other side.  Don't..  let.. him..
stop.. fighting..  in this.. world.." He shuddered, gasping for breath
that wouldn't come. "Take.. leopard head... soul cage.."
<p>
Bulma crawled over to Raditz. "Raditz? Oh, no! Please, save your
strength!"
<p>
"Silly.. woman." He managed half a smile. "Tell Kakarott.. I
understand.. him.. now."  One last shudder, and then stillness.
<p>
"NOOOOO!" Bulma screamed. She felt for a pulse, but already knew the
answer. "Oh, Raditz!" She gently closed his eyes.
<p>
"Nunk Rats?" Goten's lip trembled, tears began to fill his eyes. Bulma
hugged him, and turned him away from the carnage beside the spring.
<p>
"He's gone, baby, he's gone." Bulma began to weep. "Damn it, what is
it with you stubborn, arrogant Saiyan bastards?  As soon as I start
caring about you, you go and die! And you had to die saving my life,
didn't you?"
<p>
Golden light washed over them; Trunks looked up. "Gohan! Raditz
said--"
<p>
"I know, I heard it all. My senses are enhanced, like my strength, and
power." He looked off in the distance, and nodded grimly. "I'll push
him all right; the bastard won't have time to breathe!" Gohan
vanished, a golden streak across the sky.
<p>
Trunks hugged his mother tightly; his tears mingled with hers. "Mom, I
know we can't use the dragonballs to get Father back, but can we use
them for.." he nodded at Raditz's still form.
<p>
Bulma wiped the tears from her face. "Yes! Yes, we can, and we will! I
swear if we survive this mess, we will get Raditz back!"  She looked
around for Goten, who had wandered off. He stood near the pool of
blood, looking puzzled. He looked at Raditz's body, and then up at the
sky, and back again.
<p>
"Nan Bulma, how come two Nunk Rats?"

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Awareness returned, or rather, awareness of being aware. Raditz looked
down on his own corpse, and knew himself again.
<p>
What a mess! If I ever go back, I'll need to get new armor. That set
isn't good for much anymore. Heh. Body inside it doesn't look too
good, either. Damn. I liked life. At least I died for something a lot
better than my own stupidity, this time.
<p>
Ah, Bulma, I've hurt you where you've already been terribly hurt--I
never meant to do that. You weren't supposed to like me, damn it! And
don't you dare feel guilty for living, woman! Trunks needs you on your
feet and fighting--yeah, that's it.  So you'd use the dragonballs for
me?  Damn. Didn't know I'd made THAT good an impression.
<p>
Aw, Goten! Bulma's going to hate this--especially if she ever figures
out I dumped it on her, but-- "Hey, Goten! Get Bulma to explain it to
you--I'm going to be real busy helping Gohan beat up the bad guy, but
don't worry. Uncle Raditz will be around. Maybe not fun for a while,
but I'll be there for you. And maybe after the fight's over, I can
explain things a bit more."
<p>
Now how's Boy Wonder doing with Hornhead? Oh, yeah! Opie isn't too
happy right now, is he? Keep him busy, Gohan. I see the skeins and
weave of his power...
<p>
The ghost katana returned to Raditz's right hand, as he stalked the
Opawang across the spirit plane.  Silver threads of stolen power spun
an umbilical from the spirit fortress to the Opawang's manifested
presence. Raditz followed that silver cord into the heart of the
fortress, the Opawang's throne room. Each silver thread led to one of
the statues, statues glowing with the light of trapped souls. Waiting
for him was the ghost of the Water Ochimo, sword poised.
<p>
"You just don't know when to quit, do you?" Raditz smiled evilly.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Gohan continued with the routine he'd worked out--grab the Opawang by
a leg or arm--a gentle grip did no damage, and gave the fire shield
nothing to turn back against him--and then slam the Opawang as hard as
he could against the nearest chunk of landscape. The Opawang usually
broke when he did that, only to reshape himself and jaunt away.  Then
Gohan would chase him down.
<p>
This time the Opawang appeared behind him, apparently thinking Gohan
would not notice, and started to incant a spell. Gohan seized him by
the jaw--again gently, to avoid setting off the fire shield--and
crushed his face. That stopped the spell.  This time, Gohan remembered
to rip the gold leopard's head clasp off before he threw the Opawang
deep into the mountain.
<p>
"Oops, don't want to let him get too deep, he might have time to pay
attention to things elsewhere.  Better pull him out again." Gohan
gleefully plunged after the sorceror.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
The broken spirit of the Water Ochimo fled, wailing and gnashing its
teeth. Two swipes of Raditz's ghost blade cut all the silver cords;
two more sweeping blows destroyed the statues, freeing the trapped
souls, who milled about, looking for their bodies.
<p>
"Village, out through the roof, thataway." Raditz pointed, and
launched himself through the new hole in the roof, looking for the
Opawang.
<p>
Opie's probably noticed that--I've got to move fast, and pray Gohan
keeps him extra busy.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
This time the Opawang tried hiding behind illusion, but his evil ki
was a beacon of blazing darkness to Gohan. Gohan grabbed him and
impaled him on the roof spire of his own keep, then blew the roof
away, dropping him to the floor below.  He flew down and picked up the
stunned Opawang, and started the routine all over again.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
My, the Boy Wonder has been keeping Hornhead busy! He's still got his
power reserves, though--that's what goes first.
<p>
Raditz studied the wonderfully complex cloak of energies and forms
that made up the Opawang's spirit realm presence.  His soul, his
spirit form, his life force, that odd energy-draining shadow cloak,
and his vast reserve of magical power were all bound by an unnaturally
tight and unbreakable bond to his physical body. Raditz sensed that
the bond itself was tied to a Name, and if he'd known that Name,
Raditz could have untied the bond as easily as pulling on a shoelace.
<p>
But, he didn't.  Fortunately, unbreakable didn't mean
uncuttable. Two-handed grip for precision and power, destruction
without anger, act without doubt, purpose true and remembered-- the
ghost katana struck! The bond between that nimbus of power and the
other six forms parted and snapped; Raditz ripped away that cloud of
power.  The flood of released power overwhelmed him before he could
reject it, deflect most of it away; he reeled, stunned in the tidal
bore of power.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
The Opawang screamed in mortal agony, the first cry of pain Gohan had
ever heard from him. He wrenched his broken form from the rocks, and
teleported again. Gohan panicked; he was at the spring again! Who
would die this time?  He sped toward them at incomprehensible speeds,
and was there in a heartbeat.
<p>
The Opawang grabbed for Goten; Gohan grabbed the sorceror by his long
hair and threw him across the valley. He hit the valley wall hard, and
did not get up.
<p>
"What? His power isn't coming back the way it did every time before!"
Gohan glanced at Raditz's gory corpse. "You did something to him,
didn't you? I wish you could talk to me the way you do to Goten."
<p>
Gohan flew towards his enemy.  "He's not dead! He's way down in power,
and all messed up, but he's not dying. Great, maybe he really is
immortal."
<p>
The Opawang rose, his flame nimbus still surrounding him.  A black
aura flickered and shimmered around his broken body.  Blood covered
him; broken ends of bone cut through his skin. His horns were dull and
lightless; he looked like a corpse walking.  He lived.
<p>
"You still cannot win, for I cannot die! Your friend will pay an
eternity of agony for that foul blow--his soul cannot escape this
valley while I will it.  Yours will join him in torment, and I will
devour the children while you watch, helpless and damned."
<p>
"Shut your foul mouth!" Gohan grabbed the Opawang again, and cried out
as the sorceror seized him with two icy cold hands, cold with a black
cold that seared and drained the very life from him. Where his own
hand touched the Opawang, there too his life and power poured out.
<p>
"AAAAAAHHHHH!" Gohan tore himself away from the Opawang's grasp, and
the sorceror vanished again, but not before Gohan sensed that his
power had returned--or rather, been replenished from Gohan's stolen
power. "Owww! Watch out for the black aura, that's another nasty trick
of his."
<p>
He sensed the sorceror--back in the fortress again. "Here we go again."
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz finally pulled himself free of the explosion of power, and
found the Opawang again. Oh-ho, he's using that shadow-cloak thingy on
Gohan? That means he's not using it on me. Let's give the bastard
something to worry about. Raditz struck again, freeing the unnaturally
tight bond between life force and body.  He retreated, fast, as
shadowy tendrils returned to the spirit realm and reached for
him. "Gohan, get back in there!"
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Gohan plunged into the castle, wary of traps. Then he heard Raditz's
voice--"Gohan, get back in there!" His eyes went wide, and he blasted
through the wall into the Opawang's private chamber. The Opawang
whirled, angry, but completely healed. Flame nimbus surrouned him, but
the black aura did not--yes it did, it just returned. The sorceror
sneered, knowing Gohan dared not touch him, and raised a hand, started
to incant a spell--
<p>
Gohan brought the roof down.  For good measure, he blew the floor out,
too, and let the Opawang be caught between two layers of broken
stone. Oops, can't leave him to his own devices down there--but what's
this? "His power is down again--and weakening! He's hurt; he's really
hurt!"
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz struck again, at the deadliest remaining power.  The shadow
cloak was ripped, but didn't want to come away; Raditz struck again,
and loosened the bond between soul and body.
<p>
Good, now he can't come back as an undead, life-sucking animated
corpse. Once this job is finished, he can go to Hell like the rest of
us evil bastards. Oh, wait a minute--I didn't loosen the bond between
his spirit form and his physical body.  I guess that means his spirit
form will always be that of his rotting corpse. Tough break that.
<p>
Oh, crud. I might have to deal with this bastard in Hell some
day. Don't need to make it more unpleasant than necessary.
<p>
Raditz sighed, and struck the final blow.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Gohan was telekinetically lifting the stone off the Opawang when he
heard Raditz again. "Kid, kill the bastard. Just blast him with
everything you've got, his special powers are GONE." Gohan thought he
heard a wicked laugh, a laugh that gave him chills to remember.  Then
he uncovered the Opawang.
<p>
The broken sorceror looked up at him. "Damn you, brat! I curse you
from Hell's heart, I call upon mine ancient pact, O Child of Chaos
damn them to--"
<p>
"KA-ME-HA-ME-HA!"  SWHOOMMM! The bright blast of energy disintegrated
the Opawang, and turned the universe to a brilliant white and black
negative of itself.  Gohan rose through the broken roof, still pouring
down destruction.  Several minutes later, he finally stopped. Dust and
ash billowed up in a tremendous cloud, towering high above the valley.
<p>
"Gohan! Listen--one last thing. Take the leopard's head to the spring,
and break it. Hurry, Mountain Sister's getting angry at all the abuse
she's been taking."
<p>
"Raditz? Oh, yeah." Gohan looked around at the destruction, noting all
the holes and craters and chunks gouged out of the mountainside. "I
guess she's got good reason."  He flew down to the spring, leaving a
sonic boom in his wake.
<p>
He landed beside the grotto, and crushed the gold leopard's head on
the rocks of the spring.  The earth began shake, and the waters to
foam and rush.  A wind howled outside.
<p>
"Gohan, what are you doing?" Bulma screamed from outside. "And how did
you bring all the villagers back to life?"
<p>
"What?" He stepped out of the grotto.  Bulma was holding the farm
girl, who looked confused and terrified, but very much alive.  He
glanced at Raditz's body, but it was still very much dead. He shook
his head.  "I don't know, unless killing the Opawang did it." Gohan
had to shout over the rising fury of water and wind.
<p>
Water rose from the spring, and solidified into the form of an
inhumanly beautiful woman--moss green hair adorned with water lotus,
translucent body of blue-green water-glass, carnelian eyes. Bulma's
jaw dropped; it was the kami of the spring, the image in the pool
brought to life.
<p>
"Mother!" she cried out. "Stop! Harm them not--they have set me
free! The Opawang is no more, they have slain him--immortal no more,
he is destroyed! WE ARE FREE!"
<p>
The mountain answered; Bulma and Gohan watched in awe as Black Earth
Mountain shrugged, and the great crater where the Opawang's fortress
once stood was buried beneath a million tons of rock and dirt--a
mighty landslide that thundered down the mountain, and parted to pass
the spring and village by on either side.
<p>

<p>
"Piccolo!" Goku called, "the barrier is gone. I can see a valley there
now."
<p>
"Something's happening," the Namek pointed out, as dust rose high
into air.
<p>
"I can sense them! They're all alive, and there's some other powers,
too. Let's get down there!"

<p>
Black Earth River Daughter glided across the blood-stained pavement
and knelt beside dead Raditz. She caressed him gently, washing away
the blood with her spring waters. "Thou and thine hast destroyed mine
oppressor and freed me, brave warrior, and released my mother from
slavery. Shall I be less generous than thee, who gave everything?
Alas! I am niggardly besides thee--but what I can give, I give thee."
<p>
She kissed him, long and deep; Raditz's body shuddered, and his eyes
opened. She gave him one last caress, and vanished back into the
spring.
<p>
Raditz sat up slowly, feeling his chest with one hand. The cruel wound
was gone, healed as if it had never been. He looked at Bulma and
Gohan, Trunks and Goten with wonder and awe. "That.. was one sweet
kiss! I'm.. alive!"
<p>
"Nunk Rats?" Goten looked hopeful. "Nunk Rats fun?"
<p>
Raditz smiled. "Yeah kid, it's fun--" Goten jumped into his arms
and hugged him before he could finish.
<p>
Trunks sidled over and regarded Raditz silently. Finally, he spoke.
"Thank you. I didn't get to say that before, and--"
<p>
Gohan's head whipped up. "DAD! PICCOLO!"  His joyous shout echoed off
the mountains.
<p>
Goku dropped out of the sky onto the edge of the pavement; Piccolo
hovered above, looking boggled.
<p>
Goku glanced quickly around, and stopped to stare half-horrified at
his formerly dead older brother, who was holding his youngest son
Goten.  He couldn't help remembering another time, when Raditz had
taken his screaming, terrified son--but this time, his youngest son
was unafraid and--laughing?
<p>
"Raditz??  How?"  Without waiting for explanation, he glanced at
Bulma, Gohan, and Trunks. "Glad to see everyone is okay.. I think." He
looked hard at Gohan's burnt gi and blistered arms, Bulma's bruised
arms and legs, Raditz's shattered armor, and the copious bloodstains
on the pavement.
<p>
"Kakarott, you missed all the fun!" Raditz smirked. "Demon warriors,
ghouls, an immortal evil sorceror, a beautiful nature kami freed from
slavery, the young prince come into his heritage, raising the
dead--including my own charming self--and one hell of a good
fight. You would have loved it!"
<p>
Bulma rolled her eyes. "Well, some of us have a different word than
'fun' for screaming in terror and trying to find a safe place to hide
with the kids, but--" She looked at her old friend Goku.
<p>
"Goku, he saved our lives. If it weren't for Raditz, we'd all be
dead--or worse. ALL of us." Bulma glanced significantly at Gohan.  He
nodded in confirmation.
<p>
Raditz got to his feet and handed the delighted Goten to his father,
much to Goku's surprise and relief. Goten started telling his daddy
everything that had happened, in his usual fashion. After about the
fifth "Nunk Rats", Goku looked quizzically at Raditz.
<p>
"Raditz?" Raditz smiled slyly. Goku looked at Goten, who was pouting
because Daddy wasn't listening. "Goten, who's that?"
<p>
Goten looked exasperated, and yelled "Nunk Rats!"
<p>
Goku looked at Raditz again, and then something clicked.  "Goten,
who's your grandpa?"
<p>
"Nox King!"
<p>
"So that's Uncle Raditz?"
<p>
"Yep, Nunk Rats!"
<p>
Goku looked suspiciously at Raditz. "He's been saying that for
weeks. How did he know?"
<p>
"You didn't know, Kakarott?  The kid can see ghosts--just like his
grandfather the Ox King."
<p>
"You've been here, as a ghost??" Goku's jaw dropped.
<p>
"It's a long story, Kakarott--it started in Hell between me and
Vegeta, and it winds up.. here, with me alive."
<p>
"You just can't rid of some people," Piccolo commented sarcastically.
<p>
Raditz glanced at his one-time killer. "No, but you can ignore them
like you wish they weren't there."
<p>
Goku looked around again. "It looks like you've all been through some
kind of terrible ordeal, but everyone's alive, at least. Chi-chi will
be so happy to know that everyone's okay. She was worried sick about
Goten and Gohan."
<p>
Bulma smacked herself.  "In all this happy excitement, I forgot to see
if the phone worked." She pulled out her satellite phone and started
punching in ident codes. She tapped her foot in impatience; finally a
connection was made. "Chi-chi, this is Bulma.." She frowned, and
waited a moment. "Dad? What are you doing there? Chi-chi fainted? She
does that. Listen, tell Chi-chi and whoever else is there that we're
all fine, and Goku and Piccolo caught up with us, and we'll all be
heading home as soon as we can get the cars loaded up. Tell Chi-chi
someone needs to pick up extra groceries--if it's the usual bunch of
useless layabouts, I suppose Chi-chi will be stuck with that job,
because we've got," she looked the group over, "one, two, three, four,
five hungry Saiyans coming home for dinner. No, we didn't get Vegeta
back this time, but I've got some news of him, at least. Bye!"
<p>
Bulma looked at Goku. "Yes, it's been a terrible ordeal, and, like
Raditz said, it's a looong story--one that will be worth telling AFTER
a bath, clean clothes, and a hot meal!"
<p>
She frowned at Raditz, who was counting Saiyans in the group, and kept
coming back to himself as number five.  "Yes, you, Raditz! You're
coming home with us--you need a place to stay and I have plenty of
space, and you're the only one who can fill in about half this story,
so you damn well better come!"
<p>
Goku looked intently at his older brother. "You're.. different. You're
not like you were eight years ago."
<p>
Raditz smiled. "I'm not the only who has changed--who would have
mourned for Vegeta eight years ago? I was a fool and a bully back
then--but we've already had this talk, haven't we, Kakarott?"
<p>
"What do you mean?" Goku was guarded, calm.
<p>
"Have you forgotten? A demon castle, you and Vegeta and a fine
selection of your dead enemies?"
<p>
"I thought that was a dream!" Goku marvelled.
<p>
"Heh. Quite the dream, then--shared between two brothers, one living
and one dead. A dream that brought peace to the one dead." There was a
strange look on Raditz's face.
<p>
"Yes, I do remember our talk.. brother." Goku smiled. He clapped
Raditz on the shoulder.  "Let's go home."
<p>
"Nunk Rats come home, be fun all time?" Goten yawned sleepily, head
resting on Goku's shoulder.
<p>
"Yeah, kid, I'll be there--or maybe at Bulma's place." Raditz reached
over and ruffled Goten's hair fondly.
<p>
"Nan Bulma fun," Goten agreed.
<p>
"And it's my job to make sure she stays that way, little one."
<p>
"Huh?" Bulma interjected, distracted from her task of decanting the
aircar capsule and packing. "What do you mean by that?"
<p>
"I did promise Vegeta I'd keep an eye on you and the young prince and
protect you as best I could.  That promise doesn't go away just
because I'm alive now." Raditz's tail twitched.
<p>
Bulma looked a bit stunned as the implications sank in. "That means--"
<p>
"That means you have a loyal Saiyan Royal Guardsman, my dear princess
consort.  Enjoy it!" Raditz grinned mischievously, tail switching.
<p>
Trunks' eyes were wide. "Cool!"

<p>
The only sound was the creak of the steering oar as the great black
boat floated down the dark waters of the Stygian Nile. Her single
black squaresail was furled; no breath of wind disturbed the river of
the underworld. The shadow-cloaked steersman leaned but lightly
against the oar; this stretch of the Twelve Hours of Night was calm
and gently flowing.  His sole passenger, the crown prince of an
ancient dynasty, lounged against the gunwale, affecting a air of
complete boredom while watching and listening, alert to everything
around him.
<p>
"Hmmm.. that's interesting," the Ferryman observed. Mighty thews
flexed as the dark boatman swung the steering oar over.
<p>
The prince dropped his air of boredom. Anything that interested the
Ferryman, interested him. "What now?"
<p>
"A new ghost in the Fourth Hour. He's hailing me for a pickup,
too. Hmmph. Probably trying to avoid being eaten by those krjalk
demi-gods that barbecue sinners along this stretch.  Well, I'm not
exactly on a regular schedule right now, so..."
<p>
"What is so interesting about a new ghost in the underworld? Have
people suddenly stopped dying since I left Earth?"
<p>
"Hmmph. They stopped coming to *this* underworld about two thousand
years ago--since anyone last followed the gods of ancient Khem, or
Egypt as you foriegners call it.  Noble, too, by the look of him."
The Ferryman bared sharp teeth and tusks in his version of a smirk.
<p>
The black boat's prow bumped gently against the bank; the ghost
floundered awkwardly aboard. He wore tattered yellow robes and the
charred remnants of a leopardskin cape; he had the high features and
sharp nose that the prince had seen adorning every royal scuplture and
tomb painting along the Twelve Hours.  Unlike those impassive
sculptures, this face was set in a scowl, and angry frustration
flashed in his dark eyes.  Something howled in the darkness beyond,
and the Ferryman quickly sculled his boat off the bank, back into the
current.
<p>
"Took you long enough," the ghost snarled.  "They nearly had me. Damn
them all!"
<p>
The Ferryman answered mildly, "Patience, they say, is a virtue. It
serves me well enough.  It is also said that beggars can't be
choosers, and I think not that kindly Ra would have offered you a
place on his barge.  The stench of evil is on you, and methinks you
avoid the Devourer only because Anubis cannot find one improperly laid
to rest."
<p>
The ghost glared at the Ferryman, and at his only other passenger. The
dead prince regarded him calmly, thoughtfully. "The good Ferryman
tells me that none have come to this underworld in over two millenia.
Who are you, and why are you here now?"
<p>
"Only Osiris may know my True Name, and I come here after five
thousand years--I, who was a prince of Khem, Adept of Thoth, immortal,
undying, master of spirits--I am brought low by the ignoble whelps of
a bestial race." His face was terrible to see. "I know their names,
and the names of their fathers, and from the Abyss I will curse them
as only the dead can curse-- Such woe and grief will I bring on Gohan,
son of Goku; Trunks, son of Vegeta; Bulma, consort of Vegeta and
mother of Trunks; and Raditz, brother of Goku, that they will beg for
death and curse the day of their birth. I will bring upon them--"
<p>
"--Will you?  I think not!" cried Prince Vegeta, as his hair turned to
flaming gold.
