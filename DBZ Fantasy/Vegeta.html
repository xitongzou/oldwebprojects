He comes to Earth in search of the dragonballs, but almost got killed by his lifelong rival, Goku. After the Freeza Saga, he becomes good (sort of), marries Bulma, has a son named Babytrunks and becomes a super saiyan. He constantly pushes himself to be better than Goku or “Kakarot” as he believes that he should be the most powerful saiyan. He is a very honor-bound person, and he gets most of it from his father King Vegeta. He is very ruthless at the beginning of DBZ, as he destroys his own partner Nappa!, He gets even more ruthless when he becomes “Majin Vegeta” and kills innocent people at the world tournament. He makes himself get controlled by Babi-di, only because he wants more power and wants to fight Goku. He is the second most powerful non-fusion character in DBZ and always comes in “second-place”. He makes a bunch of stupid mistakes sometimes, like letting Cell become “perfect”, almost kills himself when he suddenly attacks Cell and had to get saved by Gohan, and ultimately releases buu when he fights Goku. He truly becomes “good” when he realizes what a mistake he has made to release buu, and sacrifices himself to destroy buu. He later saves the Z fighters by fusing with Goku and saving everyone from buu. He goes super saiyan when he pushes himself to the level that he didn't even care that Goku(Kakarot) was stronger than  him, and went super saiyan 2 while he was “Majin Vegeta”.<br>Attacks: big bang attack, final flash, gallet gun, renzoku energy dan, double energy ring, energy disc, energy flare.<br>Power level at beginning of DBZ: 18,000<br>Power level at end of DBZ: 360,000,000<br>Father: King Vegeta, Wife: Bulma, Son: babytrunks, Daughter: Bra<br>Class: Saiyan<br></p></body></html>
