 The Way to Become the Strongest</font>
</h3>
		  
  </center>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> The movie begins with a beautiful view of Mt.
 Paozu. The&nbsp;
 narrator&nbsp;
 explains that many magnificent things have begun on this mountain. A&nbsp;
 huge&nbsp;
 fish is in the water, and sees a brown tail. "Is it a cougar or a&nbsp;
 monkey?" he&nbsp;
 wonders. "It's time to eat!". The first jumps out of the water, and is&nbsp;
 kicked&nbsp;
 in and caught by a boy with a tail. That boy's name is Son Goku.&nbsp;</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 Goku is walking along a dirt road with his fish. But a girl is&nbsp;
 driving&nbsp;
 (rather poorly, almost crashing into every tree and rock on the way)&nbsp;
 along&nbsp;
 the same road. She sees Goku, and stops the car just in time to not hit&nbsp;
 him.&nbsp;
 Goku thinks she's a monster who wants to steal his fish. He throws the&nbsp;
 car&nbsp;
 into the air. Bulma comes out of the car, very angry, and pulls out a&nbsp;
 handgun. She shoots Goku in the head, but he gets back up. He says that&nbsp;
 it&nbsp;
 hurts. She's shocked that the boy is alive. She tells Goku that she's&nbsp;
 not a&nbsp;
 monster, but a human. Goku says that she isn't human because she looks&nbsp;
 different. Bulma says that's because she's a girl. Goku remembers that&nbsp;
 his&nbsp;
 Grandpa said that he should be nice to girls.&nbsp;</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 So, Goku takes Bulma back to his little house to eat lunch with&nbsp;
 him. When&nbsp;
 they get inside his house, he sits down and prays while talking to his&nbsp;
 Grandpa. But there isn't anyone else there. Goku is talking to an&nbsp;
 orange ball&nbsp;
 with 4 stars inside of it. Bulma is shocked at seeing the ball. Goku&nbsp;
 tells&nbsp;
 her that his Grandpa gave it to him, and that even girls can't touch&nbsp;
 it.&nbsp;
 Bulma pulls 2 more of the balls out, one with 2 stars in it and another&nbsp;
 with&nbsp;
 5 stars. She tells Goku that she found them in her garage, and no one&nbsp;
 knew&nbsp;
 what they were. She found an old legend that explained what they were.&nbsp;</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 Scattered across the Earth are 7 golden balls. Each star has a&nbsp;
 number of&nbsp;
 stars inside of it, 1-7. When a person gathers all 7 balls, Shenron,&nbsp;
 the&nbsp;
 Dragon God appears and grants them a wish. Bulma thought she should&nbsp;
 wish for&nbsp;
 an endless supply of strawberries, but instead wants to wish for a&nbsp;
 handsome&nbsp;
 boyfriend. She asks Goku to give her the ball, but he says no. She&nbsp;
 comments&nbsp;
 on how quickly he's grown up, and shows Goku her panties! She says he&nbsp;
 can&nbsp;
 touch her, if he wants. Goku says he doesn't want to touch her dirty&nbsp;
 but.&nbsp;
 Bulma says that he'll get experience if he comes with her, and that his&nbsp;
 Grandpa DID say Goku should be nice to girls. Goku agrees, but he'll&nbsp;
 hold&nbsp;
 onto his 4 star ball.&nbsp;</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 Bulma pulls a small capsule out her pocket, and throws it on the&nbsp;
 ground.&nbsp;
 There's a loud explosion, and a bike appears. Goku hits it with his&nbsp;
 Nyoi-bo,&nbsp;
 another momento from Grandpa, and gets in.&nbsp;</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 The screen switches to the face of a mysterious man with an&nbsp;
 eyepatch.&nbsp;
 He's rolling the 6-star ball around. "Get me the other balls!" he&nbsp;
 yells.&nbsp;</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 Back to Goku and Bulma. They're in the desert. Puar, a little blue&nbsp;
 cat,&nbsp;
 runs off to tell Yamcha that people are in the desert. Goku and Bulma&nbsp;
 are&nbsp;
 stopped by a huge green Ox in the road. Goku says the ox looks weak,&nbsp;
 and it&nbsp;
 changes into a big robot with a bowl of soup in its hand. The robot&nbsp;
 threatens&nbsp;
 to eat Goku with the soup. Goku taunts the robot, and the robot sticks&nbsp;
 his&nbsp;
 finger in the soup and burns himself. Goku shows the monster that he's&nbsp;
 strong, and picks up a bolder and breaks it with his index finger. The&nbsp;
 robot&nbsp;
 turns into a bat and flies into the air. But a few feet in the air,&nbsp;
 there is&nbsp;
 a "pop", and the bat turns into a humanoid Pig. The Pig's name is&nbsp;
 Oolong, and&nbsp;
 he explains that he can only change his form for 5 minutes. Oolong says&nbsp;
 that&nbsp;
 he wants to follow Bulma because she's pretty and he can puff-puff with&nbsp;
 her&nbsp;
 big breasts.</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Just then, a missile comes and blows up Bulma's bike. Bulma is&nbsp;
 unconscious. The ones who blew up the bike were a bandit named Yamcha,&nbsp;
 and&nbsp;
 Puar. They threaten Goku, and ask for money or hoipoi capsules. Oolong&nbsp;
 recognizes Puar and calls him "Crying Puar!" Puar tells Yamcha that&nbsp;
 Oolong&nbsp;
 and Puar went to monster kindergarten together, and that he tortured&nbsp;
 Puar.&nbsp;
 Oolong was kicked out because he stole a teacher's panties.&nbsp;</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 Goku and Yamcha start to fight. He uses his Wolf Wind Punch and&nbsp;
 smack&nbsp;
 Goku through some pillars. Goku's Nyoi-bo extends, and he gets back.&nbsp;
 Bulma&nbsp;
 wakes up now and looks at Yamcha. Yamcha, who's very girl shy, is&nbsp;
 paralyzed&nbsp;
 with fear. Puar and Yamcha run away. Bulma wonders who the hot guy was.</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Then, Bulma, Oolong, and Goku are in a field of flowers. Goku finds&nbsp;
 the&nbsp;
 1-star ball. Now they only need 3 more.
 Oolong is driving Bulma and Goku around in a motor home. They're in&nbsp;
 a&nbsp;
 snowy mountainous area. An army, called the Red Ribbon, begins shooting&nbsp;
 at&nbsp;
 Bulma and co. They are greeted by the General over a loudspeaker,&nbsp;
 saying they&nbsp;
 are at Muscle Tower. They know that they have a Dragonball, and want to&nbsp;
 get&nbsp;
 it. Goku beats up the army, and gets inside.&nbsp;</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 Goku enters Muscle Tower, and a HUGE black man is inside. Goku is&nbsp;
 only&nbsp;
 the size of his head! They fight, and Goku uses his Jan ken pon attack&nbsp;
 and&nbsp;
 punches his head off! The man was only a robot. The General says that&nbsp;Goku&nbsp;should come to the top floor if he can kill all the robots. Just as he&nbsp;
 finishes his sentence, Goku jumps through the floor and says Hi to the&nbsp;
 general.  The general realizes he's screwed, so he uses his final&nbsp;
 weapon. A&nbsp;
 giant robot who looks like Frankenstein, Android 8, is switched on and&nbsp;
 attacks. There are no pupils in the android's eyes. He beats Goku up,&nbsp;
 but&nbsp;
 stops when he's told to kill him. Android 8's pupils come back, and he&nbsp;
 says&nbsp;
 that he hates doing bad things. The General says he'll blow 8 up with a&nbsp;
 bomb&nbsp;
 inside of him unless he kills Goku. 8 doesn't care. Goku knocks the&nbsp;
 remote&nbsp;
 away from the General, and smashes into his head. This causes the&nbsp;General's&nbsp;
 neck to break. The remote explodes, and 8 is alive.&nbsp;</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 They go outside, and Goku tells 8 his name. 8 says he has no name,&nbsp;
 but is&nbsp;
 only called Android 8. Goku calls him 8-chan because that name is&nbsp;
 easier to&nbsp;
 say. They have a snowball fight and Goku invites 8-chan to come with&nbsp;
 him. He&nbsp;
 declines, saying he needs to bring the Red Ribbon people to the police&nbsp;
 and&nbsp;
 clean up Muscle Tower. Goku takes the 7 star ball, and Goku and co.&nbsp;
 leave.&nbsp;</font></p>
		  
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
 Next, Oolong is driving in the mountains. A sea turtle is in the&nbsp;
 road,&nbsp;
 and Oolong skids to a halt. The turtle went out to the mountains with&nbsp;
 his&nbsp;
 friends to get some mushrooms, but he was separated from his friends&nbsp;
 and has&nbsp;
 been lost for a year. Goku wants to take him to the sea, so Bulma and&nbsp;
 Oolong&nbsp;
 reluctantly agree.</font></p>
