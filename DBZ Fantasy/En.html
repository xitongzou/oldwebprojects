        The stressed people who were forced to test Goku and Piccolo, with them 
        getting more than they bargained for with the two super powers. </p>
      <p>Driving Lessons<br>
        Goku and Piccolo both failed miserably in these, and Chi-Chi was incredibly 
        mad. They were either too fast, too slow, too dangerous, either way they 
        were always doing something wrong inside the car. </p>
      <p><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><a name="E">E</a></font></b><br>

        destroyed it when his feelings for #18 overwhelmed him. Dr. Gero also 
        made one, but it was destroyed by the Androids before he had a chance 
        to use it on them upon them being awakened. </p>
      <p>Energy Extractor<br>
        Used by Badibi to gain energy from Gohan firstly, then used to absorb 
        the damage energy suffered by Goku and friends. The energy was used to 
        awaken Majin Buu from his eternal slumber. </p>
      <p>Energy Meter<br>
        This showed how much potential energy certain people had to drain with 
        the energy extractor. It clearly showed that Gohan had masses of energy 
        to steal. </p>
      <p>Energy Ball (KI Ball)<br>
        A common method of attack used by the strongest fighters in the universe, 
        with many different variations such as the Kamehameha, Masenko, and Burning

        energy, then releases it in a mammoth blast causing mass damage. </p>
      <p>Frieza<br>
        The most evil villain in the history of DBZ in my opinion, he had many 
        different forms which he could change into to increase his power, and 
        was merciless to others. He was eventually killed by Trunks after getting 
        defeated by Goku on Namek. </p>
      <p>Frieza's Henchmen<br>

        The small floating pod that Frieza used to get around in, it could reach 
        immense speeds, although it wasn't as fast as he could be when flying 
        his fastest. </p>
      <p>Frieza's Ship<br>
        The large craft that Frieza flies through space in, it is an excellent 
        form of transport and bares a huge glass porthole at the front which the 
        tyrant generally stares out of. </p>

        Oozarus should they dare to look up at the moon. </p>
      <p>Full Moon Krillin<br>
        This was the nickname given to Krillen after Roshi used his bald head 
        to simulate the moon in turning a werewolf back into a man. </p>
      <p>Fusion<br>
        A concept learnt by Goku in the afterlife which he implemented during 
        battle, helping to teach Goten and Trunks . It allows for two warriors 
        to fuse into one and gain huge power increases. </p>

      <p>Garlic Jr.<br>
        The small but mighty warrior who twice attempted to take over the world, 
        and was twice sealed in his own Dead Zone (You'd think he'd learn after 
        the first time). </p>
      <p>Gero<br>
        The evil scientist who created the Androids, and immortalized himself 
        as one of his own creations, putting his brain inside a cyborg body. </p>
      <p>GI<br>

        and compact, and some forms of it works as minor armor. </p>
      <p>Ginyu<br>
        The captain of his small squad of fighters, he has awesome power and an 
        incredible ability where he can swap bodies with his opponent. He was 
        turned into a frog because of this though, and was unable to get his old 
        body back. </p>

        Frieza's private army consisting of the world's most elite fighters - 
        Jeice, Burta, Guldo, Racoome, and their leader, Ginyu. </p>
      <p>Godly Water<br>
        This is a huge risk to take for any mortal man, as it is a terrible poison 
        which, if survived, can give you a massive power increase, but has a large 
        chance of killing you. </p>

        The little cricket sidekick of King Kai, he teaches the trainees how to 
        move fast with weighted objects encumbering them, thus allowing them to

        The tank that is used to heal people rapidly, where they are immersed

        he tries to grab it. </p>
      <p>Hyperbolic Time Chamber<br>
        This is an incredible training room where one day on the outside is the

        The ultimate evil, he's a monster who welds an incredible sword who could 
        only be defeated when Goku and Vegeta fused to become Gogeta. </p>
      <p>Jet Plane<br>
        Used to transport groups of people to and from places. The most famous 
        use of one was probably when Goku was taken from his house to the Kame 
        house. </p>
      <p>Joke <br>
        To be trained by the legendary King Kai, one must first tell a joke and 
        make him laugh. For some it is an easy task, but for some like Tien and 
        Goku it can prove to be quite tough. </p>

      <p>Kikoho<br>
        Tien's ultimate attack, otherwise known as the tri-beam. It takes an awful 
        lot of energy from the attacker, but in term really does injure the opponent 
        badly. If used too much it can kill the offender. </p>
      <p>King Cold's Ship<br>
        The ship used to rejuvenate Frieza after they found his 'bits' floating 
        in space. It heads towards Earth and lands there, with Frieza vowing to 
        gain revenge. </p>
      <p>King Kai<br>
        Possibly the best trainer in the galaxy, it is a debatable opinion of 
        mine that without him Goku wouldn't possess half of his strength. He was 
        taught an impressive repertoire of techniques and attacks whilst under 
        the catfish-like creature, as well as gaining a significant power boost.

        fangs. There are two classes as mentioned in this encyclopedia: Fighter 
        and Healer. Namekians come from the planet Namek, which was destroyed 
        by Frieza after all it's inhabitants were wishes to Earth (Except those 
        fighting). </p>
      <p>Namekian Spaceship<br>
        The spaceship that Bulma, Gohan, and Krillen traveled to Namek in, it 
        originally belonged to Kami, but he allowed them to use it to go and get 
        the Namekian Dragonballs. </p>
      <p>Nappa<br>
        The bald sidekick of Vegeta, he was a useful and powerful ally until Goku 
        defeated him. Vegeta then decided he had no further use for him, so mercilessly 
        slaughtered his partner. </p>
      <p>New Namek<br>
        The place that the Namek's moved to after their original planet exploded 
        thanks to Frieza. They used the Dragonballs to get them there, and lived 
        a peaceful life there until Coola came along. </p>
      <p>Nimbus<br>
        Goku's flying cloud which was given to him as a present from Master Roshi. 
        After his original one was destroyed he was able to get a new one from 
        Karin. To ride Nimbus you must be pure of heart, thus the reason Roshi 
        couldn't stay on. </p>
      <p><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><a name="O">O</a></font></b><br>
        Ocarina<br>
        The instrument that Tapion used to force Hildegern back inside of him. 
        It was very useful but eventually proved to be of no use as the monster 
        became too strong for its limited powers. </p>
      <p>Oolong<br>
        The cowardly shape changing pig who became only a minor character as Dragonball 
        went on, keeping up his constantly scared attitude. </p>
      <p>Oolong's Caravan<br>
        This came from a capsule, and was used in an emergency as Goku, Bulma, 
        and Oolong all temporarily lived inside of it. It was later destroyed 
        by Yamcha and his Panzer Faust, a bazooka-like weapon. </p>

        able to do much to the seemingly invincible kid. </p>
      <p>Plane<br>
        The particular one that I'm thinking of was a yellow passenger plane driven 
        by a young lady and her child, with Cell and Krillen fighting atop of 
        it. </p>
      <p>Police<br>
        The comparatively weak law enforcement, quite a few squadrons of them 
        were destroyed by the Androids as they grew impatient of being chased.

        at it, with it being his favorite thing in the whole world. </p>
      <p>Potara Earrings<br>
        If worn by two fighters then they immediately fuse permanently, gaining 
        an immense increase, and attaining a completely different personality 
        and appearance. This method of fusing is good because there's no limit 
        on the time that two people can stay together as one. </p>

        Seen many times throughout the series, this is where fighters concentrate

        is very caring towards her friends. </p>
      <p>Punch Machine<br>
        This was used to determine which fighters were allowed to enter into the

        by the Z soldiers who weren't even trying to hit it remotely hard. </p>

        of DBZ, with Goku's ship being among the most well-known. It is a large 
        sphere with a graviton, a bed, a closet, a bathroom, and of course, a 
        fridge. </p>
      <p>Spacesuit<br>
        The thing worn by people when they venture out into the depths of space 
        so they can breathe oxygen, and safely travel along without the need to

      <p>Transformation<br>
        Many of these occur throughout DBZ, with ones from Frieza, Goku, Cell,

        The fat, rude, arrogant fighter who befriended Goku near the start of
