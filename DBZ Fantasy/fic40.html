<p align="center"><font size="6" face="Tahoma"><strong><u>Farewell,
my love...</u></strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Tahoma">By: spbulma</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma"><em>Someone once said:
&quot;Nothing lasts forever...&quot; maybe he said it before I
fell in love with you...</em></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">I honestly have no idea how
it happened. All I remember is telling myself what a gorgeous
girl she was, and then, like to day, she falls for me, and next
thing I know, I have a kid, a wife, a home, a life... can you
believe that?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">It took me some time to
accept, but I am a changed man. And, even though in the beggining
it was a huge mess (or at least <em>I </em>thought so), slowly I
learned it was <em>me </em>who was messed up; and I tried to give
everything a second chance when my beautiful daughter, Bra, was
born. Yes, although I have changed, and everything is so
different...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Something stays the same.
After so many years, I still don't have the courage to <em>tell </em>Bulma
how I feel about her...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">You may think, &quot;How
ironic! this guy has guts to blow up a planet, but can't tell a
woman how much he loves her&quot;. Well, maybe it's because I
didn't know we would last so long, or maybe <em>you </em>don't
know the magnitude of these three words...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">But, today, it's going to be
different. I know she knows... but I bet she doesn't expect a
surprise like this...!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">As I fly closer to Capsule
Corp., I feel something heavy in the enviroment; then I get a
closer look...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma"><em>My God...</em></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">I see them all: Trunks, Bra,
Gohan, Videl, Kakarot...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">The ambulances, the horror in
their faces...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">I quickly land and
practically run closely to them, and I was about to ask Trunks
what happened, when suddenly, I look at her direction...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">She was in one of those beds
paramedics use, and she was pale, and cold, her hair hung
lifelessly over her shoulders...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">I felt my whole world go to
waste. <em>Someone tell me this is a nightmare...</em></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">A terrorizing silence hung in
the air. <em>Someone say something! </em>I looked at the only
thing I had left: my children. But they were in some state of
shock; I glanced over at Kakarot; who was tear-stricken, and this
is when I knew...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">One of the medics walked up
to me; &quot;I'm sorry, sir... I'm so sorry...&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">A total stranger told me 40
years of my life worth living had ended...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">I walked up to where she
rested peacefully, and placed my hand on her forehead; I closed
my eyes and felt how hot tears fell down my face. Then, I
whispered the words that I yearned all my life to say...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">&quot;I love you...&quot;</font></p>
