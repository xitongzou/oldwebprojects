        larger than most planets, Old Vegita posesses an immense gravity field 
        many times that of the Earth. In the beginning, Old Vegita was inhabited 
        by two races, the Tsufuru-jin and the Saiya-jins, which were constantly 
        at war. The Tsufuru-jin were an advanced race with hugely superior technology, 
        but compared to the Saiya-jins, they were physically weak. When Old Vegita's 
        moon went full, the Saiya-jins all went Oozaru and obliterated the Tsufuru-jin. 
        Furiza later hired them as his task force, but destroyed Old Vegita when 
        he felt the Saiya-jins were becoming a threat to his power. Goku, Vegita, 
        Nappa, Brolli, Paragas, Taurus and Raditsu were the only Saiya-jins not 
        on Old Vegita when it was blown to bits. </p>
