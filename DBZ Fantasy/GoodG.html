<ol><li>Android #16 is one of Dr.Gero's creations. He was created to be more superior to Android 18 and 17 but because Dr.Gero died before finishing his programing he is lacking in brain power and chooses only to fight with Goku. He is more peaceful than Android 17 and 18 and unlike them he is fully robotic instead of half human half robot. He is forced to fight against Cell to prevent him from absorbing Android 18 and is later destroyed by Cell who crushes his head, causing Gohan to transform into his SSJ2 level.</li>

<P>
<BR>
<li>He is the son of Vegita and Bulma. He is a pretty powerful saiyan. and he introduces himself by killng Freeza. By now you're probably pretty confused, so let me lay it out for you. Gokou, didn't completely kill Freeza, he let him out to die in space, pieces of him everywhere. (sorry for being so graphic). But Freeza's father, King Cold, found him and had his scientists put him back together. So then they went to earth (of course). And then Trunks came. He was from the future. Bulma is an extremely talented Scientist/ inventor, so she built a time machine to send future trunks in. So he came and turned Super Saiyan, and Killed Freeza and King Cold.Trunks originally came here to warn Goku of the Androids and gave him some heart medicine, because in the future, Goku dies of a rare heart disease.Eventually, he goes back to the future and kills off
Android 17,18&Cell.</li>
