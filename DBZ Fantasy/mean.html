              Budoukai - What does it mean?</font></b></font></p>
            <p>Tenkaichi Budoukai, very roughly, translates into, &quot;The World's 
              Greatest Martial Arts Tournament&quot;. Now, I know you are saying, 
              &quot;How did you get that?&quot; Well, it's simple, when you know 
              a little bit about Japanese. Let's take it one step at a time. If 
              you look at it, and you know about Japanese, you see, Te N Ka I 
              Chi Bo Do Ka I. Well&#133;Te and N go together, as do I and Chi, 
              plus, Ka and I, and, Do has an U at the end of that. So, that makes 
              it: Ten Ka Ichi Bu Dou Kai. Ok, Tenkaichi Budoukai, but, what does 
              it mean. Well, let's go through this one step at a time again. Ten, 
              means, Heavens or Sky, while, Ka means Under or Beneath. Ichi means 
              One, First, or Greatest. Bu is for Martial Arts. Dou means, a Way 
              of, and, Kai means Meeting. Your saying, &quot;How did you get, 
              Heavens Beneath One Martial Arts Way of Meeting?&quot; Hey, don't 
              take it seriously; Japanese is very mixed up, comparing it to the 
              English language. Ok, once more, we will go through this, step by 
              step again. </p>
            <p>Ten/Heaven or sky with ka/under or beneath makes, &quot;Under the 
              Heavens&quot;. So, that isn't in the title, &quot;The World's Greatest 
              Martial Arts Tournament&quot; Well, think, what is under the Heavens? 
              The Earth, or, the World. Ichi, well, that means, one, first, or 
              greatest. Put that with the first part, and you have, &quot;The 
              World's Greatest&quot;. </p>
            <p>Ba, that means, Martial Arts, so, with Dou, a way of, you have, 
              &quot;Martial Arts&quot;. Your saying, &quot;&#133;what happened 
              to the way of?&quot; Ok, well, let's get back into Japanese mood 
              again. When you add those two, with the word, Martial Arts, which 
              is a Japanese way of fighting, which is sort of like a way of already 
              combining it with the first word, which, you just have to tell everyone 
              what you mean anyway. </p>
            <p>Ka and Budou, makes, &quot;Martial Art's Meeting&quot;. Well, when 
              you get a whole bunch of fighters in a tournament, do they sit and 
              have a conversation? Of course not, they fight, and have the tournament, 
              which, Budoukai means, &quot;Marital Arts Tournament&quot; </p>
            <p>Ok, well, we ran out of words and phrases&#133;nothing left to 
              say, except, &quot;The World's Greatest Martial Arts Tournament&quot; 
            </p>
