<font size="-1" face="Times New Roman" color="white">
<P>Vegeta looked into the fog the voice still echoing. "Kakorotto! Is that you!" Vegeta's voice echoed along with the other voice. "You have failed me Vegeta! You have failed me!" Vegeta's face was pale as he listened to the voice. "Who are you! What do you want!" Vegeta walked into the fog even farther, still looking around. A tall figure appears deeper into the fog with a cape and wearing Saiyan armor Vegeta stepped back scared even more than before seeing that the figure resembles his father. Vegeta suddenly begins to run towards the figure than stops the fog suddenly clearing and he figure now in front of Vegeta. Vegeta's eyes filled with horror seeing he was right, it was his father. Vegeta's father looked down at him with a frown. "You have failed me my son!" Vegeta took a step back. "What have I done father What have I done!" Vegeta yelled out at his father trying to keep his composure. "You have failed me! You have allowed a third class Saiyan to defeat you!" "Father! I've tried to defeat Gokou! I have tried many time!" Vegeta looked at his father the look of fear still on his face. "You could have been training to become stronger than this low class Saiyan but instead you help him in battle!" King Vegeta's voice rose as he spoke to Vegeta. "You have ashamed me! You have failed me son!" "I am sorry Father forgive me! Give me another chance!" The king looked Vegeta, "Very well son. I shall help you defeat this Gokou! I have gotten stronger while I have been dead. I now can go Super Saiyan and farther just as you. You must wish me back in one month! Then you and I shall both defeat this Gokou and any who try to help him." "Yes father I shall train until it is time to wish you back." Vegeta looked at his father than bowed and turned around walking back into the fog thinking about his orders.</P>

<P>"Vegeta...Vegeta wake up..." Vegeta opened his eyes looking at Bulma. "Vegeta wake up your supposed to meet Gokou today remember?" Vegeta sat up looking at Bulma. "It was a dream? No it couldn't have been, he must've really been talking to me...I must do as I was told..." Bulma looked at Vegeta, "What?" "Nothing I was just thinking about something." Bulma walked into the closet and walked out with Vegeta's clothes. "You need to hurry up and change," Bulma tossed Vegeta the clothes, "You're supposed to meet Gokou in fifteen minutes." Vegeta slipped into the clothes and walked out of the room. "Daddy! Daddy! Look I made you breakfast!" Vegeta looked at Bra holding a bowl of Cereal up at him. "I have no time to eat!" "But, I made it just for you." Bra looked up at her father. "I said I have not time!" Vegeta yelled out at Bra. Bra lowered the bowl and lowered her head sniffling, "I'm sorry daddy..." Vegeta looked down at his daughter holding the cereal and sniffling. "Oh ok I'll eat the cereal!" Bra looked up and smiled holding the bowl back up at him, "Here you can eat with me at the table!" Vegeta took the bowl and walked over and sat down at the table and began eating the cereal. "You like it daddy?" Vegeta looked at Bra. "I would've rather had eggs, but this will do." Bulma walked out of her bedroom and looked at Vegeta. "Vegeta I'm in a hurry can you take Bra to the nursery?" "I have no time! Cant trunks do it!" Bulma crossed her arms and looked at Vegeta, "You know Trunks is with Goten, I would do it but I am late to work already." "Oh alright I'm sure Kakorotto can wait." Bulma smiled as she began to walk towards the door, "Thank you Vegeta, and it's not Kakorotto its Gokou." Bulma walked out the door and Vegeta looked at Bra then finished up his breakfast. "Ok Bra come on time to go." Bra ran into her room and got her jacket on. She ran back out and looked up at Vegeta. "Ok lets go."</P>

<P>Vegeta stopped the car and he and Bra got out, then he pushed a button and the car disappeared in a puff of smoke leaving a small capsule in its place. "Ok Bra go inside," Vegeta looked at Bra as he set the capsule in his pocket. "Aren't you going to give me a kiss on the cheek? Mommy always does?" "No Bra not right now I have to go! "But mommy always gives me a kiss!" Bra said begging to cry. "Oh all right!" Vegeta looked around at everyone then bent down and gave Bra small kiss on the cheek then got back up. Bra smiled then turned around and ran inside. Vegeta sighed then looking around he began focusing on his ki and began to fly away towards Gokou's direction.</P>

<P>"Hey Vegeta! What's up? Where have you been I have been waiting here for thirty minutes?" Gokou smiled as Vegeta landed in front of him. "I had to take Bra to school." "Gokou looked at Vegeta then began to stretch out, "So how was your morning? Anything happen?" Vegeta grinned remembering earlier, "Yeah Bra made me breakfast, It was only a bowl of cereal but It was cute." Gokou smiled then did a back flip, "I bet it was Vegeta, well lets begin." Goku pulled out a capsule and threw it down a huge gym appearing in a puff of smoke. Gokou and Vegeta walked in looking around to see a fighting ring and equipment to work out with. "I'll raise the gravity then begin to lift some weights." Gokou walked over to some weights and began to work out as Vegeta raised the gravity to 110x Earth's gravity. Vegeta slowly walked over to a bench and smiled happy that Bulma had finally made a gravity machine that could go farther than 100x Earth's normal gravity. Vegeta and Gokou worked out and sparred for the whole day till late that night. When Vegeta got home he pulled out Bulma's dragon radar and slipped it into his pocket then he pulled out a capsule like the one Gokou had earlier. Vegeta hid the two things and went to sleep.</P>

<P>The next day Vegeta told Bulma he was going to be gone for a while he, he told her that he was going to be training non stop for a month then left before she could say anything. For the next month Vegeta did nothing but train. He ate when he needed to and he slept for only four hours everyday. Vegeta did this for a month. Having trained in 150x Earth's gravity Vegeta sighed wishing the machine could go even higher but it couldn't. Vegeta pulled out the dragon radar and began finding the DragonBall's laughing the whole time happy of his new strength. "This is amazing! My speed has increased and I haven't even taken a senzu bean yet!" Vegeta smiled as he found all of the DragonBall's and landed back next to the gym. "Eternal Dragon! Come and grant my wish!" The sky darkened as Vegeta said these words and lightning struck the DragonBall's, a dragon suddenly shot out of the DragonBall's and looked down at Vegeta, "You have summoned me! You shall get one wish!" Vegeta smiled looking up at the Dragon. "Eternal Dragon I wish you to bring my father back to the mortal realm!" The dragons looked down at Vegeta still its eyes glowed, "It shall be done!" A bolt of lightning shot down and the dragon suddenly disappeared, and the DragonBall's shot into every direction. Vegeta smiled and knew it would only be a matter of time before Vegeta's Father arrived to meet up with him. Vegeta walked into the gym and began working out once again.</P>

<P>A week had passed and Vegeta was growing impatient waiting for his father. He walked out and looked up at he sky suddenly a streak of light shot towards the Earth and landed about a mile from the gym. Vegeta flew off towards the direction of the crash. Vegeta looked down at a Saiyan space pod and smiled as his father stepped out. Vegeta flew down and looked at his father smiling. "The time has come my son." King Vegeta hovered off of the ground, Vegeta looked up at him. "Well aren't you coming!" Vegeta sighed and hovered off of the ground as well, "follow me father!" Vegeta shot off towards Gokou's direction, looking back every once and a while to see his father trailing behind him.</P>

<P>Vegeta landed in front of Gokou's house and walked up to the door, "Father you wait here I will get him out." Vegeta knocked on the door and Chichi answered the door. "Hello? Oh hi Vegeta! You're probably here for Gokou I will go get him!" Chichi walked into the house and a few minutes later Gokou walked out smiling. "Hey Vegeta! Need something?" "Gokou can you step out her for a second?" "Gokou stepped out and looked around. "what do you need Vegeta I was in the middle of dinner Chichi will get mad If I'm not in back in there in a second." "Don't worry it will only take a second..." Suddenly King Vegeta flew down from the sky and kicked Gokou in his chin, Gokou flew back hitting a tree. "What the..." Gokou got up and looked at King Vegeta. "What the... you look just like Vegeta just older!" "That's right Gokou! You third class Saiyan! You shall die!" Vegeta looked at his father and smiled and got into his fighting stance looking at Gokou tensing up every muscle in his body feeling his Saiyan blood run through his veins as he prepared for an attack he slowly began t draw on his ki. King Vegeta got into his fighting stance as well, then leaped at Gokou his fist ready t punch hi in the chest King Vegeta began to concentrate on his ki sending it into his hands his hands began to glow a bright red and once King Vegeta was close enough to Gokou he let out a fury of punches towards Gokou's chest. Gokou looked at the punches and quickly drew on his ki for speed his hands flying up towards his chest blocking the punches. Gokou flipped back and kicked King Vegeta in the jaw sending him back a few feet but he regained his balance, Gokou stood straight up and looked at the two then balled up his fists and yelled out concentrating on his ki drawing on it for speed and strength his muscles began to bulge as he yelled out a bright red aura suddenly flaring around Gokou the ground beneath Gokou cracking then exploding into pieces Gokou suddenly stopped yelling and looked at Vegeta with a smirk on his face.</P>

<P> King Vegeta looked at Gokou and smiled, "It takes you that long to charge up that much?" King Vegeta smirked, "You truly are weak Saiyan, I am surprised you defeated my son, I'm surprised you even defeated Frieza!" Gokou looked at the king still smirking. Gokou suddenly phased away leaving an after image of himself and appeared behind King Vegeta then dropped down for a low sweep at King Vegeta's feet. King Vegeta jumped up doing a spin in the air kicking a Gokou's neck, Gokou raised his right arm the kick hitting it then Gokou leapt up and phased away again appearing in the air. Gokou closed his eyes and decided for a quick defeat asking the Earth for energy a ball of ki appeared in the air above Gokou's hands and it began to grow as he concentrated he smiled pulling as much energy together as he could in such little time he stopped when the ball of ki was about the size of himself then opened his eyes and looked at Vegeta who had heard of the attack before and began charging up while Gokou gathered energy for the spirit bomb Gokou. Gokou looked at King Vegeta sensing his new strength then lunged the ball towards the King quickly facing away and appearing behind King Vegeta he charged up a small ball of ki in his fist as soon as he appeared then formed it into energy for speed and punched at King Vegeta's back the fist hitting Vegeta causing him to fall to the ground flipping over and standing up looking at Gokou.</P>

<P>Gokou smiled as King Vegeta just stood here then suddenly the Spirit bomb hit him from behind enveloping him in light. King Vegeta fell to the ground in pain and began to get up slowly. "I see I have underestimated you...you are a very good fighter." Gokou smiled, "But you seemed t have forgotten one thing..." "and what would that be?" Gokou looked at the King smiling still, "You have forgotten about my son!" Vegeta suddenly leaped at Gokou and released a fury of punches and kicks towards him, Gokou paying very close attention to Vegeta's attacks began to black and dodge the kicks and punches. King Vegeta's face was suddenly filled with awe, "How could he do that? He wasn't even paying attention to my son, there's no way he could've dodged those attacks with the speed my son was going!" Vegeta flipped back away from Gokou and stood in his fighting stance. "Father this Saiyan has learned to focus on ones ki without a scouter. He sensed me coming towards him, that is how he managed to block the attacks." King Vegeta got up and smiled, he closed his eyes and sent a telepathic message to Vegeta "Son you must keep him busy for me, I have a plan!" King Vegeta opened his eyes still smiling and Vegeta nodded. Suddenly Vegeta leaped at Gokou again and began attacking him even faster than before. The two Saiyans exchanged blows going at an amazingly fast speed and the King raised his arms and began concentrating on his ki.</P>

<P>The King closed his eyes and continued to concentrate a red ball of ki appearing in the sky and beginning to grow slowly at first than faster the King drew on all of his ki as Vegeta fought Gokou. Vegeta flipped back again and looked at Gokou for a split second then ran towards him and dropped down sweeping at his feet. Gokou feel to the ground the jumped back up Vegeta threw out a kick and kicked Gokou in the ribs, Gokou fell back then got in his fighting stance trying his best to ignore the pain in his body then he ran at Vegeta and they began exchanging blows again. King Vegeta smirked as the ball of ki grew he suddenly yelled out the ball of ki suddenly growing even faster King Vegeta opened his eyes and continued to concentrate watching the two fight he suddenly stopped yelling and looked up at the ball of ki smiling. "Vegeta! Move!" Vegeta looked at his father and was kicked by Gokou falling back then getting up and closing his eyes he suddenly phased away and appeared next to his father.</P>

<P>The King looked at Gokou then threw the ball of ki towards him. Gokou looked at the ball of ki in chock before he could do anything he was hit by the attack. He yelled out then the ball of ki exploded sending light everywhere. As the light faded Gokou's body was seen laying there dead. The King smiled then turned to Vegeta. Vegeta smiled and bowed to his father. "We have won father he is dead!" The King smirked, "Now Vegeta I shall finish you off!" Vegeta looked at his father with a look of both fear and confusion. The King yelled out and suddenly sent of a white explosion of light that faded slowly. Vegeta looked as the light faded and saw a figure that did not resemble his father, as the light faded completely Vegeta saw that instead of his father standing there it was Frieza! "Now I shall kill you Vegeta!" Frieza raised his arm then smirked. Vegeta looked up and realized the red ball of ki had been split into two, Frieza had only used half the ball of ki to kill Gokou. Frieza swung his arm down and sending the ball of ki towards Vegeta. Vegeta looked at the ball of ki and began to run as fast as he could a blur behaind him, he could barely be seen. Then the ball of ki suddenly sped up and hit Vegeta. Vegeta yelled out.</P>

<P>"AHHHHHH" Bulma looked at Vegeta then pushed him slightly. Vegeta opened his eyes and got up out of bed sweating and breathing hard. "What's wrong Vegeta?" Vegeta looked at Bulma, "Frieza! Where is he! He killed Gokou!" Bulma looked at Vegeta a little confused. "Vegeta you were asleep, Frieza is dead, I think you were having a nightmare." Bulma got up and threw Vegeta some clothes, "You had better hurry up, your supposed to meet Gokou today remember?" Vegeta looked at the clothes. "yeah ok..." Bulma looked at Vegeta, calm down Vegeta it was just a dream. Well I have to go now, I'll take Bra to school. Bulma walked out and Vegeta stared at the clothes still, "A dream...it was just a dream..."
