<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 1: The Fight of the 
Century is Between Freeza and Son Goku</font></span></u><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
As everyone is fighting against Freeza, Goku is getting healed in a rejuvenation 
tank to make himself ready for the fight. After it seems all it lost, Goku 
finally comes over and stops Freeza. There is a small fight before the big bang. 
Goku semi-tests his new strength against Freeza and seems to be doing pretty 
well. Freeza, however, is not amused. Vegeta is just about to do something that 
is totally out of character. </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 2: Vegeta Dies from 
Freeza</font></span></u><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
While Freeza was done firing ki blasts at Goku, Vegeta couldn't help but laugh 
that Freeza will die by Goku. Freeza is done listening to Vegeta and fires a ki 
blast through his heart. Before Vegeta died, he told Goku all about how is life 
was tormented by having to follow Freeza's order, all the way to his death. He 
told him Freeza didn't care for anyone but himself, and, hates everyone he 
knows. He especially hated me (says Vegeta) and that is why I want you to stop 
him. With that, Vegeta lies down to rest himself, to his death. </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 3: Goku's Anger is 
rising at Kaiouken x20! </font> </span></u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Goku tells Vegeta he promises that he will get revenge for Freeza doing all 
those bad things to him, and, the great battle insures. Goku starts to attack 
Freeza, and, an exchange of punches, kicks, and ki blasts at each other. After 
powering up to Kaiouken x20, Goku is just about a match for Freeza, but Freeza 
always seems to be even better than him. Goku, coming up with a plan, decides to 
move on and try to kill him with a special attack. <br>
<br>
<u>Act 4: Is This the End!? Son Goku Throws the Genki Dama!</u><br>
After a long wait, the Genki Dama is finally finished, even after Freeza would 
continually hit and kick Goku, he still held up the Genki Dama. When every last 
bit of ki energy was necessary, Goku finally threw the Genki Dama at Freeza, 
while Freeza was just about to destroy the planet. Freeza had no choice but to 
take the blast head on. Afterwards, everyone was rejoicing. </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 5: Freeza Takes His 
Anger on Krillin </font> </span></u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
After what seemed like Freeza had died, he really hadn't. Just when everyone was 
making plans to go home, Freeza showed himself again, and was mad as a hornet. 
He tried to kill Goku first, but Piccolo stepped in and took the blast for him. 
Piccolo then fell unconscious. Freeza then used a ki attack to bring Krillin in 
the air, and, make him explode. Goku couldn't believe his eyes that his best 
friend had died before him. Freeza then told Goku that his little brat was next. 
Goku couldn't take it anymore, and, went over the top. He then turned into a 
super Saiyan. </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 6: That was a Mistake. 
A Super Saiyan is Born </font> </span></u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Son Goku is raging mad. But, how would you feel if your archenemy killed your 
best friend? Anyways, Goku starts to grow in power, every second. Freeza cannot 
believe this. What he had feared worse was standing before him. However, Freeza 
knew he could take him. Goku decided to prove him wrong. After about a couple 
hard punches to the face, Freeza couldn't take it very much anymore. He wanted 
to make an offer now Goku couldn't refuse. </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 7: The Power of Two 
Awesome and Great Fighters Collide! </font> </span></u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Freeza told Goku that he could power up to his 100% form and give him a real 
challenge since he had transformed. Goku, being a Saiyan, couldn't resist. Kaio 
Sama disagreed, but Goku knew he could defeat him no matter what. After a death 
Kamehameha, Freeza didn't want to risk it anymore. He had now decided that 
enough was enough. He was going to kill Goku now, even though they two were on 
the planet, he knew a way to kill him. Act 8: Goku Finally Kills the Evil 
Emperor Freeza shot a Kienzan at Goku that had a tracker on it, to only focus on 
Goku. Even if it hit a boulder, it would still keep going. Goku had to fly and 
fly around, until, the Kienzan lost him, and, Freeza decided to start another. 
Now, two were chasing him, but Goku lost them both as well. Goku kicked the snot 
out of Freeza for just a bit more, until, one of the Kienzan cut Freeza in half. 
Freeza had lost his lower torso, half of his tail, and half of his left arm. In 
the end, Goku gave Freeza some of his power, so he could live, but, Freeza used 
that power to go against Goku, but, Goku was still more powerful, and, shot 
Freeza into nothing.</font></span>
