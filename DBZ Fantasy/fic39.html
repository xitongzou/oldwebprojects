<p align="center"><font size="6" face="Tahoma"><strong><u>You Say
I'm Not Your Friend...</u></strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Tahoma">By: spbulma</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma"><em>You say I'm not your
friend...</em><br>
<em>but I will prove you wrong...</em></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">You say I'm not your friend.
In fact, when you first came here, you fought me and vowed to
destroy me. And even though my friends all fought against you
(they died, for that matter) and told me to finish you once and
for all, I let you go, because I knew you would come back...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Well, eventually I saw you
again, and eventhough everyone said you couldn't be trusted, you
were the one who restored my health, and I remember, in that
attempt, you were going to inyect me with a needle, and I started
to holler and you had to use another thing. Then, after I fell
asleep on the regeneration tank, I could still feel you there,
watching over me...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma"><em>You say I'm not your
friend,</em><br>
<em>that I'm a nuissance and you'll get rid of me...</em><br>
<em>so much time has passed,</em><br>
<em>and I'm still waiting...</em></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">If I'm not your friend, then
why did you protect my son, Gohan, on the battle with Frieza? You
really didn't have to do that... and then, just moments before
dying by the hands of that monster; To whom was it that you told
what happened to your life, and held your pride (a little) by
actually crying? You came to <em>me</em>. The person you
supposedly despise the most.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Much after that, when we were
back on Earth, I noticed you started acting a little bit
different, but, to be honest, I didn't know what it was, until a
lavender-haired young man told me the truth. I guess I was
shocked; and he also told me I would die of a heart disease...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Of course, you didn't know
about any of this, and you even came to me once, complaining
about what an annoying woman She was, and so on, but what you
never dreamed of happening was that I knew that &quot;Woman&quot;
would be the one to bear your son...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">The son that, even though you
seem to ignore, you're very proud of...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma"><em>*Yes, I know, and you say
I'm not your friend...*</em></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">You see, friends don't have
to <em>say </em>anything, they have a bond... that connects with
the heart... and you know, you know how that person thinks, or
feels...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Even though the others say
things like: &quot;He's such a jerk!&quot; or &quot;Who does he
think he is?!&quot;, I smile silently on a corner, knowing
there's more to you, that you said you would kill me, but you
save me from any situation...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">So, the inevitable day came
when <em>I'd </em>save you...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">It was when that thing, Cell,
came... he went wild, and I had to think fast, so, the only
thought that came to my mind was to... sacrifice myself...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">It hurt me deeply, but it had
to be done. So before taking that last step, I looked back...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">And there you were, not
believing what you were seeing, and something told me you didn't
want it to end this way, but all I managed to say was a farewell
to my friends...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">Now that I'm alone, in the
other world, sometimes I think...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">You said I wasn't your
friend, that I was third class and pathetic; but if you really
meant that, you would've killed me a long time ago, you wouldn't
have saved me and my son countless times...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Tahoma">And you wouldn't have shed a
single, crystal tear when I said goodbye...</font></p>
