<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><b>Paikuhan*</b>&nbsp;
A tall, green fighter in the Annoyoichi Budoukai, he is very similar to Piccolo
in looks and personality, although he is not Namekian.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He wears clothing similar to Piccolo's, including a turban, and is very
quiet and serious.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Goku even comments on the likeness between the two as he
watches Paikuhan fight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Paikuhan
also takes Piccolo's previous position as a rival to Goku in the tournament.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They battle each other in the finals of the Annoyoichi Budoukai, and have
a very close match (mostly because Goku doesn't go Super Saiyajin).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although Goku ultimately wins, for Paikuhan to nearly equal Goku even in
normal form is very impressive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
his character is first introduced in the anime, Paikuhan breaks up a riot in
Hell, and without Goku's aid he beats the living crap out of Frieza, King Cold
and Cell.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp; </span>Paikuhan also has a
significant role in DBZ Movie 12.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
movie begins with Paikuhan and Goku duking it out in the finals of the
Annoyoichi Budoukai.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Their battle
is interrupted by the explosion of the Soul Cleansing Machine and the havoc
wreaked across the Afterlife by Janemba in his first form.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>While Goku and Vegeta go to fight Janemba himself, Paikuhan is
responsible for breaking the force field over King Yama's Palace created by
Janemba.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While his kicks and
punches do next to nothing, he discovers by accident that the only thing capable
of breaking the force field is cursing and violent threats, something which the
Stoic Paikuhan quickly finds quite challenging.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>After only cracking the force field slightly with minor
curses, Paikuhan grows impatient and finally in a rage he screams several of the
nastiest things one might reserve for their worst enemy, and the force field
instantly cracks to pieces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Near
the end of the movie, Paikuhan tries to help Goku and Vegeta, and ends up
distracting Janemba long enough for the two Saiyajin to fuse into Gogeta.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although Janemba appears to "kill" Paikuhan right before Gogeta
arrives on the scene (as Paikuhan is not shown again for the rest of the movie),
the fact that Paikuhan is already dead and that he is in the Afterlife during
the battle brings one to assume that he is merely knocked out by Janemba, and
not truly killed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it is
never proven either way, but left to the viewer to decide.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><b>Pan</b>&nbsp;
Daughter of Gohan and Videl, granddaughter of Goku.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Born in the year 779 AD, she competes in the 28<sup>th</sup> Tenkaichi
Budoukai when she is only 5 years old.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
proves her Saiyajin bloodline by completely wrecking her opponents, including
Goten, her 17-year-old uncle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pan
plays a larger role in GT, where as a teenager she embarks on a long journey in
space with Trunks and Goku to find all of the Black-star Dragonballs scattered
across the galaxy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Originally, it
was Goten who was supposed to travel with Trunks and Goku, but while Goten
sleeps late, Pan sneaks onboard the ship and takes his place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She develops quite an attitude, and gets into a lot of trouble on
different planets.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Gill, the helpful little robot who travels with them, tries
to protect Pan, but usually ends up getting yelled at by the independent
teenager.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, deep down Pan
really has feelings for the little guy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With
the exception of Android 18, Pan is the most powerful female fighter in the
anime series.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><b>Panboukin*</b>&nbsp;
The chunky, quick-tempered member of Bardock's crew.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He obtains a scar in Oozaru form during the battle on planet
Karnassa in the beginning of the Bardock Special.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In the dub, Panboukin is made to look like a smart-mouthed
idiot that says stupid things like "the bomb", but in the true Japanese
version he is not all-mouth and no-brain, but he is actually rather sharp.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><b>Piccolo
- "Pikoro" (see Piccolo (Original), Piccolo Daimaou, Kami)</b>&nbsp; One of
the most powerful fighters in DB/Z/GT, Piccolo is a green-skinned, slug-like
alien from the planet Namek.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Piccolo
is the reincarnation of Piccolo Daimaou, his father.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Just as he is dying (from a fatal blow by Goku), Daimaou
spits out an egg containing an unborn clone that is to become the embodiment in
which Daimaou reincarnates himself – Piccolo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Because Daimaou's spirit is reincarnated in the clone, he retains all
of Daimaou's memories and abilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although
the final "spawn" of Piccolo Daimaou refers to himself only as Piccolo,
rather than using his full title, he continues to hold the same dark powers over
the spirit world, and so Piccolo is still considered the Great Demon King.&nbsp;
Piccolo holds many special natural abilities due to his Namekian ancestry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He does not eat food, but needs only water for sustenance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Nameks are a slug-like species, and thus Piccolo inherits multiple
talents such as the regeneration of limbs, and, after a time, asexual
reproduction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He has fangs, super
hearing, purple blood, and he even speaks some of the ancient Namekian tongue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Piccolo is a warrior-class Namek, and one of the only Namekians on Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>From the very day he is hatched, Piccolo vows to take revenge on the one
who killed his original body - Goku.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All
during his youth, Piccolo continues to train in order to defeat and destroy Goku.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The young Namek first appears in Dragonball at the 23<sup>rd</sup>
Tenkaichi Budoukai, where he faces off with Goku in an extremely close match.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Goku barely defeats Piccolo with a huge Kamehameha that knocks the Namek
out cold.<o:p>
</o:p>
&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Piccolo appears again in
the first episode of DBZ as the second person Radditz encounters on Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Piccolo makes a temporary alliance with Goku in order to take out the
intruding Saiyajin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Though they are
overpowered by the massive warrior, Piccolo uses his new special technique, the
Makankosappo (Special Beam Cannon), which generally means "Screw Attack of the
Devil", to finish Radditz.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>While Goku restrains his brother, Piccolo fires a beam so
powerful that it literally drives a hole right through Radditz and Goku, killing
them both. His revenge on Goku and Radditz now complete, Piccolo gloats over the
dying Radditz that Goku's friends will revive him with a wish from the magic
Dragonballs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With a sneer Radditz
informs Piccolo that he sent every word the Namek had spoken to his compatriots
Vegeta and Nappa using the scouter as a relay device, and that they are coming
to Earth in one year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In a burst of
rage, Piccolo fires a beam at Radditz, finishing him.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Kami immediately observes that, unlike every being killed by
Piccolo before him, Radditz's spirit rises to the Afterlife.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In Dragonball, Piccolo Daimaou's dark powers include the
effect that any creature killed by the Demon King would be cursed to wander the
Earth as a spirit for all time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Kami
concludes that because of this strange occurrence, Piccolo must be changing
internally, even developing a conscience.</span><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;
</span>Piccolo decides to train the young son of Goku, Gohan, in hopes of making
him a young warrior who can help defend the Earth from the Saiyajin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Out of thin air he conjures clothing and a sword for Gohan, then leaves
him alone in the wilderness for 6 months to learn how to survive on his own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After 6 months pass, Piccolo takes the boy in and trains him directly,
teaching him martial arts and how to focus his ki.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Gohan begins to think of Piccolo not only as a teacher, but a best
friend, and as time goes on, Piccolo himself grows quite fond of the boy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When the Saiyajin arrive, Nappa fires a beam at Gohan that would
certainly kill him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
Piccolo jumps in the path of the beam to take the blast instead, sacrificing
himself to save Gohan's life.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Since Kami and Piccolo are still attached in spirit, if one
dies they both perish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just before
Kami fades, he remarks that Piccolo has a soul, because of what he has done for
Gohan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This fact alone may be what
motivates King Yama to let Piccolo pass to Snake Way.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Piccolo makes the long journey to King Kai's planet and
trains there a while, although he detests King Kai's style of teaching.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Later in the Frieza Saga, Piccolo is wished back to life and on the
planet Namek.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On his way to fight
Frieza, he fuses with another dying Namek, Nail, and becomes more than twice as
strong as he had been, with a power level of over 1,000,000, allowing him to
face Frieza in his second transformation alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Piccolo is nearly killed in the lengthy battle with Frieza, and again
when fighting Garlic Junior.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Later
in the Android Saga, Piccolo and Kami make the decision to fuse permanently in
order to stand a greater chance against the androids and Cell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The two rejoin their spirits into one body as the Namek without a name,
the original Piccolo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The fusion
creates a power increase so great that Piccolo is referred to as a "Super
Namek".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although his mergings
don't appear to change Piccolo physically, internally he retains the memories
and experiences of both Nail and Kami. After rejoining with Kami, Piccolo
becomes more philosophical, and takes even more "heroic" actions that
endanger his own life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For example,
he seals himself, Gotenks and Buu in the Room of Spirit and Time.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Later in GT, when the Black-star Dragonballs are about to
cause the planet to explode, he offers to stay on Earth and die with his own
planet. Rather than be teleported away with the rest of Earth's inhabitants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He does this primarily because of Kami's influence concerning his
attachment to the planet.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Like the captain who goes down with the ship, as Kami, or
God, remains a part of Piccolo, he feels inclined to perish with the loss of his
planet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course, he dies, and his
soul overall is clean enough to rise to Heaven.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>However, with Goku later trapped in Hell, no ex-Demon King
can simply sit around and do nothing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Piccolo
goes on a frenzy and wreaks total havoc in Heaven until he is literally thrown
out, at which point he willingly changes places with Goku in Hell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Piccolo remains in Hell until the end of GT.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Whether or not he is ever wished back (or if he even WANTS to be) is left
for the viewer to decide. (What a way to end a series).<u style="text-underline:words"><o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><b>Piccolo<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Original) - "Pikoro" (see Piccolo Daimaou, Kami, Piccolo)</b><o:p>
</o:p>
</span>&nbsp; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The original Namek
without a name, he was born on Planet Namek in 250 AD and journeyed to Earth
hundreds of years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He came in a
strange-looking Namekian ship that requires at least a basic knowledge of the
ancient Namekian language to pilot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Piccolo
is one of the only Nameks in the series who is not directly related to Guru.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, Piccolo is of Guru's generation, and his father's name is
Katastu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although he forgot his
origins after landing on Earth, Piccolo probably left Planet Namek to escape the
violent storms and the terrible drought that followed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>These catastrophes, which nearly wiped out all life on Namek, occurred
almost 500 years before the beginning of Dragonball.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Guru was the sole Namekian survivor, and so once he became old enough to
gain the power, he procreated asexually to populate the planet again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, at least one other Namek survived the drought; this Namek was
the young Piccolo, who had escaped in the Namekian ship to another planet he
could survive on – Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although
he retained his grasp on the Namekian tongue, he could not remember who he was
or where he had come from.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He could
have lost his memory in an instant by hitting his head either in the landing of
his ship or afterward, or he may have simply forgotten his origins over the
passage of time as he lived alone with little or no human (or otherwise) contact
for hundreds of years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter
is more likely, although it is never specified how he came to forget his
origins, and thus the events of Piccolo's youth during that span of several
hundred years remains unclear.<o:p>
</o:p>
&nbsp; As time passed and the young Namekian grew, he witnessed many violent
acts and watched as entire wars were waged before his eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Later he participated in many of these wars, and became a great warrior.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, he had made friends and contacts along the journey to find
himself, and he was recognized by the Kami during that period as a being worthy
of taking his place one day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
the time came for a new Kami to be chosen, those few in line for the throne
gathered together, and the contenders were narrowed down to two: Garlic and
Piccolo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While both were quite able
to rule, only Piccolo had honest and pure ambitions for the throne, while
Garlic's ambitions were impure and selfish at best.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>With this knowledge, the old Kami chose Piccolo as the next Kami.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But Piccolo could not yet rise to the throne, for although his intentions
were pure, his heart had been corrupted by his troubled youth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Because he was yet impure, Piccolo had to be cleansed of his dark side.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The cleansing process ultimately caused the original Piccolo to split
into two separate beings equal in power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One
was pure, while the other half was evil incarnate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The purified Piccolo rose to the throne and from that point on, became
known as Kami.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The evil half came
to be called Piccolo Daimaou, or the Great Demon King Piccolo.&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The
original Piccolo remains split into these two, Kami and Daimaou who later
reincarnates himself in his asexually-cloned spawn Piccolo, for quite some time.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not until the beginning of the Cell Saga that he is
seen again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At this point the two
halves Kami and Piccolo solemnly and a bit reluctantly decide to fuse in order
to become a being more than twice as powerful as either of them combined.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is a necessity that they must undergo to become strong enough to
defeat the androids and save Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
they re-fuse, they once again become the original Namek who had no name
(although he later named himself Piccolo, supposedly, though how he received his
name is not specified.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This portion
remains unclear).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Piccolo never
again splits into two beings, as the personalities of the two Kami and Piccolo
become infused as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus he
also surrenders his position as Kami to a younger, pure Namek named Dende.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Piccolo remains in his original form for the rest of the series.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><b>Piccolo
Daimaou - "Pikoro Daimaou"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(Piccolo
the Great Demon King) (see Piccolo, Piccolo (Original), Kami)&nbsp; </b>The dark
half of the original Piccolo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hundreds
of years before Dragonball began, the Namek who had forgotten his origins was
chosen to succeed the old Kami as the new God of Planet Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, this Namek who called himself Piccolo was impure, and could not
rise to the throne until he could cleanse his soul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The process of purifying Piccolo's soul actually caused him to
literally split into two separate beings equal in wit and power:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>his pure half, who refers to himself only as Kami, and his dark side, who
came to be called Piccolo Daimaou, or the Great Demon King Piccolo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As the incarnation of evil, he has dark powers and holds some control
over the spirit world.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>For example, whosoever Piccolo Daimaou deliberately kills by
his own hand, their soul cannot rise to the spirit world, but will be cursed to
wander the Earth as a spirit forever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
his creation, Piccolo Daimaou wreaked havoc all across the Earth, and was
virtually unstoppable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even Kami,
perhaps the strongest being on the planet, could only equal him in power, but
never overcome him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason for
this was because the two halves of Piccolo remained bound in spirit, and so they
were still technically the same person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
fact also meant that if Piccolo Daimaou were destroyed, Kami would perish with
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No solution to this could be
found, until finally in the year 461 AD, when Master Roshi's sensei the great
Mutaito stood up to the Demon King.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
two faced off and Mutaito induced the suicidal Mafuba sealing attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although Mutaito lost his life performing the move, his attack succeeded
in sealing Daimaou inside the Denshi Jar, where he remains imprisoned for
several hundred years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Much later
in 753 AD, Emperor Pilaf manages to find the Denshi Jar and sets Daimaou free,
plotting to conquer the world with the Demon King's power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, while Pilaf believes he is using Piccolo Daimaou for his own
wicked purposes, it is really the other way around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Pilaf nearly succeeds in taking over the planet, while Daimaou battles
Tien and Goku.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Piccolo Daimaou,
like all Nameks once they reach a certain age, inherits the ability to asexually
reproduce.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He begets a total of
four children by spitting them out of his mouth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Some of them are quite clever, and they are all feisty and vicious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Goku destroys all of them but one (whom Yajirobe kills) and overpowers
Daimaou.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, Goku fatally
wounds the Demon King by propelling himself through Daimaou's torso, leaving a
gaping hole in his chest the size of a beach ball.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Before he dies, Piccolo Daimaou spits out a final egg.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the egg s not his spawn, but rather contains the embodiment in
which Daimaou reincarnates himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, he spits out an unborn clone that is the reincarnation of his own
spirit, and retains all of his memories and abilities, including his martial
arts skills.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although Piccolo
Daimaou dies, his spirit continues to live on in his unborn "son", or his
clone, and so Kami remains alive as well.</span></font></p>

- "Pirafu"</b>&nbsp; A little blue imp who appears many times during
Dragonball.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His ambition is to one
day take over the world, and he nearly succeeds until Goku arrives to thwart his
plans, usually at the last minute, often by accident.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He has two assistants, Shao and Mai, who do most of the work for him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He appears almost twice as much in the anime as compared to the manga.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>At one point in Dragonball, he collects all of the Dragonballs and is
about to make his wish when Oolong jumps in the way and screams a different wish
than anyone had planned on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pilaf
is never seen during DBZ, but in the first episode of GT he makes a final
appearance as an old man (or imp).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
finds Kami's Tower along with the now elderly Shao and Mai, and they manage to
recover the seven Black-star Dragonballs hidden in the Tower.<span style="mso-spacerun:

Goku teleports in front of them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pilaf
screams in rage and exclaims that he wishes Goku were a little kid again so he
could beat him up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
the Black-star Dragon overhears this and grants his wish.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><b>Porunga</b>&nbsp;
The dragon of the Namek Dragonballs, created thousands of years ago by Guru.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The name Porunga is a Namekian word, but its meaning is unclear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This dragon appears when all seven Namek Dragonballs are gathered in one
place and his name is uttered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
since this dragon was created by a Namekian, a wish can only be granted if it is
spoken in Namekian tongue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
dragon is much bigger than the Earth Dragon, about 5 times larger in size.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He has the power to grant three wishes to any person that
successfully calls upon him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Porunga
is stronger than Shenlong in some ways, in that he can grant the same wish as
many times as someone can wish it, but he is not strong enough to bring more
than one person back from the dead in one wish, while Shenlong can bring the
entire population of Earth back to life if needed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The dragon cannot grant a wish that goes beyond the power of his creator.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After the three wishes are made and granted, Porunga leaves once again,
and the dragonballs scatter all across the planet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The dragonballs also turn to stone, as they cannot be used for a year
after a wish is granted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
since the planet Namek has three suns, a Namekian year is really only about 4
months on the planet Earth, which becomes helpful to the Namekians later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When the Namekian year has passed, the dragonballs become active again,
ready to be gathered and wished upon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
his creator dies, the dragon "dies" with him, and so Porunga and the Namek
Dragonballs disappear when Guru dies unexpectedly right before Vegeta wishes to
be granted immortality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But when
Guru and many others that died because of Frieza were brought back by the Earth
Dragonballs, Porunga returns as well, ready to grant a final wish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although Guru dies after arriving on Earth, before he passes away he
appoints Muuri, the second eldest Namek and his first son, the new Namek Elder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, Muuri takes his place as the Great Namek Elder and Porunga can live
on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unlike the Earth Dragonballs,
which are relatively small and can be held in the palm, the Namek Dragonballs
are much bigger and heavier, each about the size of a large basketball.</span></font></p>

Zun, just as Babidi creates the arena in which they will fight to resemble his
home planet, thus giving Pui Pui the greater advantage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Grinning, he tells his opponent, Vegeta, that the gravity on his home
planet is ten times that of Earth, but Vegeta only laughs and sneers in his
face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Babidi had expected Goku,
Vegeta and the others to be strong, but he did not anticipate that they would
train under gravity several hundred times Earth's (Vegeta had trained in the
most, 400x gravity).<span style="mso-spacerun:

match, Punta repeatedly insults Krillin, who is much smaller and shorter of
stature than he.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Punta tells
Krillin about how badly he's going to defeat him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Krillin, on the other hand, is embarrassed about having to fight such a
weak competitor, and he knocks out Punta with a single punch to the stomach with
his eyes closed.</span></font></p>

one of the four survivors of the destruction of planet Vegeta.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He is a tall Saiyajin with long black hair who searches for his brother
Goku in order to recruit him as a warrior for Frieza to work with the remaining
Saiyajin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He tells Goku of his
past, and tries to persuade him to wipe out the life on Earth and come back to
space with him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When Goku flatly
refuses and asks him to leave, Radditz kidnaps his nephew Gohan and tells Goku
if he does not destroy all intelligent life on Earth in 3 days, he will never
see his son again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of
complying, Goku takes off on Kintoun and, accompanied by Piccolo, follows
Radditz to his pod.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Radditz locks
young Gohan in the space pod and prepares to battle the two challengers after
detecting their approach with his scouter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Radditz is more than a match for the two, easily beating them down, until
Goku gets the idea to grab his brother's tail, which he knows to be a weakness
among his kind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Desperately Radditz
begs him to stop and promises to leave Earth if he lets go, but Piccolo detects
that the Saiyajin is lying through his teeth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Goku lets him go despite Piccolo's warning, and Radditz simply kicks
Goku down and continues to beat him up until Gohan's anger finally explodes,
and the boy bursts out of the space pod.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Gohan
attacks Radditz and spears him in the chest, breaking his Saiyajin armor and
seriously injuring his uncle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Radditz
seriously underestimates the potential power of both Piccolo and Gohan, but
especially Gohan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In a rage Radditz
punches Gohan and knocks him out, but Goku grabs Radditz in a bear hug around
the shoulders and holds him there, allowing Piccolo to charge a second
Makankosappo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because he is
weakened from Gohan's attack, Radditz cannot escape from Goku's hold, and
the deadly Makankosappo goes through both of the Saiyajin entirely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Before Radditz dies, Piccolo jeers at him that they can wish Goku back
with the Dragonballs, and he proceeds to tell him about the seven magic balls
that can grant any wish desired.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately
for Piccolo, Radditz wisely records every event and every word spoken with his
scouter, and he sends the information directly to his Saiyajin allies Vegeta and
Nappa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When the two Saiyajin hear
of the seven magic balls, they will come searching for them and eventually kill
all life on Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Radditz tells
Piccolo this and laughs in his face, and in a rage Piccolo blasts him for a
final time and kills the Saiyajin shortly before he would have died anyway.</span></font></p>

Vegeta.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As he battles on, he also
loses teeth and continues to get even uglier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Recoome has a number of attacks to his credit, most of them with
simplistic, often silly names such as "Recoome Punch" or "Recoome Body
Attack!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The anime takes it a bit
further, but the Pioneer dubbed version takes it so far as to even give Recoome
a battle quote that is in reality a haiku: "My name is Recoome / It rhymes
with doom, and you'll be / Hurting all too soon!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Recoome breaks every bone in Krillin's body, and beats on Gohan a
while.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Vegeta takes on the
behemoth, but even the Saiyajin prince cannot match the strength of the brute.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Just before Recoome fires what could have been a fatal blow to Vegeta,
Gohan dives in at the last moment and saves him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Later when Goku arrives, he knocks out Recoome with a single punch to the
gut.<span style="mso-spacerun:
