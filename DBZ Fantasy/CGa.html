Woman - “Earobi no Onna no Hito”<o:p>

appears on TV during the early Cell Saga.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>While the others are struggling against first form Cell, Master Roshi and
Oolong watch from the Kame House as she teaches an aerobics class with a little
spice and a whole lot of bust.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Not surprisingly, the two perverts get quite a bit of enjoyment from
watching her vigorous workout.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Afterlife
Martial Arts Tournament Announcer - “Annoyoichi Budoukai Anaunsa”</b>&nbsp;
The mushroom-headed man with the mic in the Afterlife Martial Arts Tournament.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>You can never tell if the mushroom is hiding his face or if it IS his
face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>This
guy has a big booming voice for such a shrimp, as he has to speak loud enough on
the mic for the entire afterlife audience to hear.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Akane

</span>Her older sister is Aoi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

Toriyama</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span></font></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">The
great creator Toriyama-san himself shows up in Dragonball (drawn in his robot
form) from time to time as a spoof.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>He was born in 1955 and worked on Dragonball from 1984 to 1995.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Alligator</b>&nbsp;
An alligator who likes to sunbathe in a hammock on Kami Island.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

up looking for the Kamesennin.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Almond

Might.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>He
is killed by Goku.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Android
Number 8 - “Jinzouningen Hachi Gou AKA Hachan”</b>&nbsp; Dr. Gero’s first
“successful” creation, (although there was a huge plot hole in the anime
that said Dr. Frappe invented him).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Android Number 8 is ordered to kill Goku after he takes on the Red Ribbon
Army, but he refuses because he does not like to fight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Number 8 is quite powerful, but he also possesses a conscience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>He befriends Goku who gives him a new name, Hachan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>After the Red Ribbon Army is defeated, Hachan goes to live a peaceful
life with Snow.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Android
Number 13 - “Jinzouningen Juusan Gou”*&nbsp; </b>The tall leader of the
Androids and main villain in DBZ Movie 7,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>“The Three Super Saiyajin”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>You could almost say he was a rip-off of Cell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>By himself he is fairly powerful, but when he absorbs two components from
Androids 14 and 15, he turns into a big monster with dark blue skin and bright
red hair, called Super 13.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Goku finishes him in a complicated way of forming a spirit bomb, and
absorbing it into his body as he goes Super Saiyajin, so that he can “fire”
it.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Android
Number 14 - “Jinzouningen Juuyon Gou”*</b>&nbsp; A big purple-grey guy with
few words and plenty of muscle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>One of the three androids in DBZ Movie 7, he eventually faces off one on
one against Trunks, who kills him with his sword.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Android
Number 15 - “Jinzouningen Juugo Gou”*</b>&nbsp; One of the three androids in
DBZ Movie 7, he is basically a purple, alcoholic midget in a funky green hat and
yellow sunglasses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Also an android of few words, he says nothing but “Kakarotto” and
takes a swig from his whiskey can every few minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>He faces off with Vegeta, and has an interesting demise.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Android
Number 16 - “Jinzouningen Juuroku Gou”</b>&nbsp; Android 16 doesn’t battle
any of the Z Senshi, due to the incomplete programming that identifies Goku as
his only enemy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>He loves the Earth and nature, and wishes no harm to come to it or the
plants and animals that thrive there. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span>At
first he speaks very little, and is assumed weaker by the other androids (which
are actually cyborgs by definition, while 16 is a true android), but later he
proves himself to be stronger than either 17 or 18, and even imperfect Cell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>He is shattered by Cell, but Bulma and Dr. Briefs rebuilt him, in doing
so also removing his self-destruction device.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Android 16 suppresses his goal to destroy Goku long enough to join the
Cell Game, but he eventually sacrifices himself while fighting Cell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>His last words to Gohan offer a final encouragement, which becomes the
trigger event ultimately causing Gohan’s anger to explode, releasing his
hidden powers that allow him to achieve Super Saiyajin 2.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Android
Number 17 - “Jinzouningen Juunana Gou”&nbsp; </b>An enhanced human, Number
17 is technically a cyborg, rather than an android.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Both he and his sister, Number 18, were once gang members who were
captured by Dr. Gero and forced to undergo the mad scientist’s numerous
experiments, in which he wiped their past memories of everything, including
their names, and gave them great power by combining machine and man, creating
two magnificently powerful cyborgs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Number 17’s last real battle in Dragonball Z takes place with Piccolo,
a fight that ends in a draw (though it can be argued that the fight was never
finished).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>The
android is later absorbed by Cell and dies with him, but he is resurrected with
the dragonballs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>He lives alone in the forest for the remainder of Dragonball Z, until
later in GT, when he returns to fuse with his clone (which Dr. Gero and Dr. Myuu
built in Hell) and become Super 17, a being so powerful that he gives even Super
Saiyajin 4 Goku a run for his money.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Android
Number 17 (Future) - “Mirai no Jinzouningen Juunana Gou”</b>&nbsp; Similar
to his counterpart of the past (the present dimension, for the while), he has
the same adventure-seeking attitude of present day Android 17, yet he seems to
have more of a lust for blood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>He enjoys destroying city buildings and likes to drag race air cars over
pedestrians for fun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>He is killed by Future Trunks, upon the boy’s return from the future.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Android
Number 17 (New)*</b>&nbsp; Created by Dr. Gero and Dr. Myuu in Hell, the new
Android 17 is not human, but purely android, rather than cyborg like the
original “androids”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>He is pure evil and can control the original Android 17 to some degree by
a psychic link.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Android
Number 18 - “Jinzouningen Juuhachi Gou”&nbsp; </b>Though referred to as
androids, both she and her brother Number 17 are humans enhanced by machines, or
cyborgs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>A
bit calmer and more thoughtful than her brother, Number 18 takes a much larger
role in the series.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>She marries Krillin later in Dragonball Z, and their daughter is named
Marron (not to be confused with Maron, Krillin’s ex girlfriend from the Garlic
Jr. Saga).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>Number
18 goes on to fight alongside Goku in GT and some of the movies as well.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Android
Number 18 (Future) - “Mirai no Jinzouningen Juuhachi Gou”</b>&nbsp; Much
like Number 18 of the present dimension, she has the same vain attitude and
apathy for her brother’s reckless habits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>And then, she has her violent side, one far worse than that of her past
counterpart.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Android
Number 19 - “Jinzouningen Juukyu Gou”</b>&nbsp; Unlike 17 and 18, Number 19
is a true android, with no human parts to him, although he is man-like in
appearance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>He
has a white face and a strange yellow hat with one sharp point on the top.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>He is somewhat chubby, and in the dub version, his voice is quite
high-pitched to the point of annoyance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Number 19 has the ability to absorb another’s energy by sucking it into
each red ball on his palms whenever a ki blast is fired at him, thus making him
stronger and weakening the opponent in one move.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>He nearly kills Goku, who is weakened by his heart disease, until Vegeta
steps in, saving Goku on the claim that only he has the right to kill Kakarotto.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Android 19 tries to absorb all of Vegeta’s ki by grabbing his wrists
and refusing to let go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Vegeta takes care of this by ripping off his hands, then finishes him off
with his new lethal move, the Big Bang Attack.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Android
Number 20 - “Jinzouningen Nijuu Gou” (Dr. Gero)</b>&nbsp; This android shell
serves as a new body for Dr. Gero in order for him to carry on his life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>After finishing Androids 17 and 18, the doctor created a robotic version
of himself, which he calls Number 20, removed his brain from his own frail,
aging human body and placed it in the powerful, immortal body of an android.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Like 19 he can also absorb energy in through his palms, and is eventually
killed by his own creation, Android 17, who kicks Dr. Gero’s head off and
stomps on it.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Angela
- “Enjira”*</b>&nbsp; A girl who develops a quick, though fickle crush on
Gohan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>He
agrees to go on a date with her, when she claims she knows his “secret” and
threatens to tell everyone, a secret that Gohan mistakenly believes is his
secret identity as the superhero the Great Saiyaman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Gohan later discovers that the secret was actually only the fact that
Gohan wears teddy bear underwear.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Aoi
Kimidori&nbsp; </b>Akane Kimidori’s older sister, both of whom appear in Dr.
Slump, an earlier work of Akira Toriyama’s, and later in Dragonball.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Aoi runs the Coffee Pot café in Penguin Village.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Appule
- “Apuuru”</b>&nbsp; One of Frieza’s henchmen on planet Namek, he has
purple skin with orange spots over his enlarged bald head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>He is killed by Vegeta when the Saiyajin escapes from the rejuvenation
tank on Frieza’s ship.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Arale
Norimaki</b>&nbsp; The main character in Dr. Slump, Arale-chan is a hyperactive,
fun-loving little robot built by Senbe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Even though she is only a young child, (she was born in the year 745 AD),
she is brilliant and is already in high school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Goku meets her in the manga in Dragonball, and they travel around
together for a bit on the Nimbus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>She later rescues Goku by beating up Blue Shogun.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Arqua
- “Aqua”</b>&nbsp; An odd little competitor in the Annoyoichi Budoukai, also
called the Afterlife Martial Arts Tournament.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>He resembles a man crossed with a fish, and while he’s a terrible
fighter on land, even Goku finds that Arqua is virtually peerless and
practically unbeatable under water.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Atla

life, Lemlia, who has been taken against her will to be the bride of the King.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>When Vegeta and Nappa break out of the prison, Atla escapes along with
them to rescue his love.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Just as the two lovers are about to embrace, Vegeta fires a huge, fatal
beam toward the planet Arlia, utterly blasting it into oblivion.</span></font>
