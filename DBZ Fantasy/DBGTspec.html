                <b>Story</b><br>
                A hundred years have passed since the end of DragonBall GT and 
                the only character still alive from the series is Pan. Her grandson, 
                Goku Jr., sets out to find the four-star DragonBall to save his 
                ill grandmother by asking Shenron to save her. Unfortunately, 
                Goku Jr. is very cowardly and unaware of his true power, unlike 
                his great grandfather Goku. While on his journey, Goku Jr. is 
                joined by Pahku, a bully who picks on him at school. Together 
                they set out for Mt. Paozu where the four-star ball resides.<br>

                <b>Thoughts</b><br>
                This movie has some great humor and the story is well done, despite 
                the lack of familiar characters from the three DragonBall series. 
                There's also deep emotion when Goku Jr. encounters his Great Grandfather.</p>
