<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Nail
- “Neiru”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></b> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The strongest Namekian
warrior on the planet Namek, he is the personal guardian of the Great Elder
(Guru).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His maximum power level is
42,000, much higher than most of Frieza’s henchman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When Frieza threatens the Great Elder, Nail offers a challenge to Frieza
in order to distract him away from Guru, and Frieza unwittingly accepts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although he fights honorably and with great courage, Frieza beats Nail
horribly, defeating him almost effortlessly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When he senses that his death his near, Nail laughs in Frieza’s face as
the changeling realizes the eternal dragon has been summoned, telling him that
the boy had the password to the dragonballs all along.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Frieza instantly takes off, leaving the Namekian warrior to die.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, Piccolo comes across the fallen Nail while flying toward Gohan
and Krillin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nail offers to give
his strength to Piccolo by merging their energies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Piccolo is reluctant to merge, but he also knows that times are desperate
and he needs the energy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He finally
agrees, on the terms that they keep his body, and the two Namekians fuse
permanently, joining their energies to create a new Namekian more powerful than
ever before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Piccolo’s strength
is more than doubled, and he blasts off to find Frieza.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although the two have fused, Nail’s spirit remains alive within
Piccolo’s and can separate itself at will.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nail shows face twice more in the series, once when he looks at Dende,
and the last time when Piccolo is fighting Frieza. Nail’s features take over
for several seconds as he taunts the befuddled Frieza that he is still alive and
back for vengeance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nail remains a
part of Piccolo for the rest of the series, although his personality never
surfaces separately from Piccolo’s again after the Frieza Saga.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Nappa&nbsp;</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">
A big, hulking Elite Saiyajin who accompanies Vegeta to Earth in the Saiyajin
Saga.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nappa considers himself and
Vegeta to be “partners”, although Nappa is much the weaker of the two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>While the manga only shows them as fellow soldiers, in the anime Nappa is
portrayed as a sort of personal bodyguard for Vegeta when he was a child.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Since childhood Vegeta had already been stronger than his own father, and
Nappa, who was about 30 years old, feared the prince’s power from early on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As Vegeta grew in age and strength, it became more obvious that the idea
of Nappa being a “bodyguard” was really only Vegeta’s tolerance of his
presence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nappa carried out most of
the work that did not require a great amount of intelligence, and Vegeta did the
rest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nappa is about 50 years old
when he first appears in the manga.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
is bald and has a thick mustache, and is considered ugly by most standards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the Bardock Special, Nappa is shown with a small tuft of hair, but
this is obviously many years earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although
he is not stupid, Nappa is not particularly brainy, and when his temper flares,
he loses control of himself, particularly when an opponent proves to be stronger
than he in combat.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span>&nbsp; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Upon arriving on Earth,
Nappa promptly destroys the entire city he and Vegeta have landed in, wiping out
all signs of life in a radius of at least 20 miles.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He chops off Tien’s arm with a single blow, and destroys
several helicopters of idiotic news crews who pull in too close.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Chaozu latches onto his back and blows himself up in attempts to take the
life of the Saiyajin, but Nappa is practically untouchable at a power level of
4,000, leagues ahead of most of the Z Senshi at the time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the anime, when Vegeta forces him to wait for 3 hours, Nappa decides
to have a little fun, and flies out to the coast to meet Earth’s military
forces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Saiyajin blasts his way
through fighter planes, ripping and tearing as he goes, and destroys entire navy
and air force fleets that attack him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
an Elite Saiyajin, Nappa has evolved a bit, and so minor problems that lower
Saiyajin like Radditz experience are beyond him, such as intense pain when the
tail is pulled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not knowing this,
Piccolo attempts to restrain him by yanking his tail, but Nappa only punches his
lights out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Saiyajin nearly
kills Gohan with a huge ki blast, but Piccolo leaps in the way of the beam and
takes the shot instead, sacrificing himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When battling Goku, Nappa begins to lose his cool as he starts to realize
that the 3<sup>rd</sup> class Saiyajin could possibly be stronger than he.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;
</span>Nappa has the worst potty mouth in the entire series, next to Vegeta only
because the prince lasts as a major character for much longer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He constantly curses at Goku as the 3<sup>rd</sup> class warrior defeats
him at every turn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Vegeta forces
Nappa to stop fighting when he loses all control during combat.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Nappa obeys, but instead of resting, he mistakenly chooses to
release his rage upon Gohan and Krillin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Goku
must use Kaio Ken to stop him, and ultimately breaks Nappa’s back in doing so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>To everyone’s surprise, Vegeta turns on Nappa and kills his own
“partner” for his insolence by blasting him into oblivion.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;
</span>Nappa returns near the end of GT when Hell breaks loose upon the Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He appears to want revenge on Vegeta for killing him, but his power level
is still nothing compared to Vegeta’s, and it is unclear whether or not he
actually thinks he has a chance against the prince.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Either way, with a smile, Vegeta simply blows him away again.<o:p>
</o:p>

Kai -<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>see King Kai<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Oolong
- “Oorongu”</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; A
perverted, greedy shape-shifting pig, he meets Goku and Bulma in one of the
first few episodes of Dragonball.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
terrorizes a village and is known there as “Oolong the Terrible”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He kidnaps three young women in the form of a huge scary monster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Oolong has the ability to change his shape into any form, even inanimate
objects, but he can only hold that form for 5 minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His strength is not increased by the change, and he can’t turn into
something that can be used up, like fuel or food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Goku and Bulma are offered a dragonball as a reward for the safe return
of the girls to the villagers, and so they search out Oolong, only to find that
the monster doesn’t wish to fight Goku.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Naturally
Bulma and Goku follow him to his lair, only to discover that the girls have been
living like queens in his cave, which is actually more of a palace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Oolong willingly returns the girls, who have been eating him out of house
and home, and agrees to help Bulma and Goku on their quest for the dragonballs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He has a fair amount of money and a huge collection of women’s
underwear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Oolong was born in the
year 740 AD, and went to shape-shifting school with Puar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although she made straight A’s, Oolong flunked out, explaining why Puar
can hold any form as long as she chooses, while he has a limit of only 5
minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He is 3’9” tall and
weighs 71 lbs.&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">At first
Oolong tries to take the dragonballs for himself, but he eats some cursed candy
that causes him to have to pee anytime someone says the word “piggy”, which
Bulma often uses against him in the first saga.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Eventually he becomes good friends with Goku and the others, and helps
them to find more dragonballs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
Pilaf steals the dragonballs from them and is about to make his wish to rule the
world, Oolong heroically dives in the way and interrupts him, shouting that he
wishes for the panties off a hot babe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Almost
immediately, a pair of panties with a pink bow on them come down from the sky
and smack Oolong in the forehead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
perverted pig appears every so often in Dragonball, helping out the gang when he
can.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In DBZ, his character dwindles
to little importance, although in the anime and several movies, he appears quite
often as comic relief.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Ox-king
- “Gyuu Maou”</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; Chi
Chi’s father and Gohan’s grandfather, he is an over-sized warrior with a
thick beard, wears glasses and dons a Viking-style hat with horns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Many years ago, he trained under Master Roshi alongside Grandpa Gohan
under Master Roshi.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Ox-king once lived with his daughter in their mansion atop
Mt. Frypan, and killed anyone who came after his treasure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He still feared that thieves would steal his treasure, so he hired a
sorcerer to conjure a spell that would barricade his fortress with a wall of
fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only problem was, the
sorcerer cast the spell before Ox-king or his daughter had gotten back inside
the castle, and so the two could not return to their own fortress through the
wall of fire that was supposed to protect them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ox-king and the young Chi Chi are forced to live at the bottom of the
mountain until they can find a way to break the barrier that keeps them from
their castle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bulma, Goku and the
gang stumble upon Ox-king and Chi Chi on their quest for the dragonballs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They agree to help him, and Goku brings back Mutenroshi, the only one
strong enough to break the barrier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Roshi
fires a large Kamehameha at the wall of fire, and destroys it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the Kamehameha is so big that it takes the entire mountain with
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although his castle is gone,
Ox-king and Chi Chi build another home on Mt. Paozu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After Goku finds Chi Chi, who had been missing, and returns her to her
father, Ox-king offers her to Goku as a wife in gratitude of her safe return.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Not know what a wife is, Goku shrugs it off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Many years later, Chi Chi is a teenager and Ox-king wants to make sure
that she will get a good husband who can take care of her, so he makes a
fighting contest with Chi Chi as the prize.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Goku loses the contest on purpose, but Chi Chi beats up his opponent so
that he still wins the prize – Chi Chi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ox-king
may seem fierce at first glance, but he is really a nice guy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After losing his mansion and treasure on Mt. Frypan, he gives up being a
warrior and, although he is still huge, is more visibly friendly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In DBZ, he appears in the anime more frequently throughout the sagas,
usually seen at home trying to calm Chi Chi down.</span></font><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
