         If you are going to email us about this game, please put
         Rollercoaster Tycoon as the subject.  Or just RCT.  Also please
         realize that we are not hiding cheats or any other information,
         i.e. everything we know about RCT is in this guide.

         If you see any mistakes, or have anything that you want to add
         please email us!  We will, of course, give you full credit for
         your addition, and be eternally grateful to you.

         Before emailing us with a question, be sure to check out the
         Frequently Asked Questions section.

         An alternative to email is a Message Board.  There is a board
         on GameFAQs, which was made specifically for all three versions
         of RollerCoaster Tycoon.  If you don't want to use email for
         questions, use the message board listed below.  It's for
         RollerCoaster Tycoon.  I decided this one will work better than
         having you post on all three of the boards.

| If you haven't read the Game Manual and are reading this, we highly          |
| recommend that you read the manual first, since this Guide is meant more as  |
| a supplement to an already good manual, rather than as a replacement for it. |
| That's not to say that you need to have read the Manual for this to make any |
| sense, just that we don't cover a lot of things already in the Manual. (like |
| how to build elevated paths) Enjoy!                                          |
|                                                                              |
| The Add-On to RollerCoaster Tycoon was released!  Check below for more       |
| information!  Also the Scenario Editor has been released!  Check that out in |
| the Editors section.  Now throughout the guide we have noted everything that |
| is new to the Add-On.  Oh, and if you are wondering where the Manual to the  |
| Add-On is, it is in the CD case (This is true for both Corkscrew Follies     |
| and Loopy Landscapes).                                                       |

| This guide is updated often, so stay tuned!                                  |

| New Info on the Add-On Pack, Corkscrew Follies/Added Attractions!  This is   |
| directly from the Official Site: (http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com)        |
|                                                                              |
|   Added Attractions is the official add-on pack for RollerCoaster Tycoon by  |
|   the game's creator, Chris Sawyer. This will add new types of roller        |
|   coaster, including historical rides like the Virginia Reel and Side        |
|   Friction Roller Coaster, as well as the latest modern rides like the Steel |
|   Twister Roller Coaster and Steel Wild Mouse to name a few.                 |
|                                                                              |
|   In addition, new scenery, including Jungle and Jurassic themeing, themed   |
|   banner signs, and new styles of footpath will allow you to make your park  |
|   even more varied and interesting.                                          |
|                                                                              |
|   Plus, with over 25 new scenarios, no RollerCoaster Tycoon player will want |
|   to be without this.                                                        |
|                                                                              |

|   Note: This is an add-on pack and a full version of the RollerCoaster       |
|         Tycoon game is required to use the add-on pack."                     |
|                                                                              |
|   You can check the Official Page (http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com) for   |
|   some screenshots!                                                          |

| By the way, in the US the Add-On is called "Corkscrew Follies".  Which       |
| I think is a very lame name.                                                 |
|                                                                              |

|   Stretch your imagination with the new Loopy Landscapes Expansion Pack.     |

|   Note: Loopy Landscapes is shipped with a copy of Corkscrew Follies/Added   |
|         Attractions.  So, all you need is a copy of the original RCT to be   |
|         able to run Loopy Landscapes.                                        |

1. Scenario Walkthroughs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As the title indicates, this section of the FAQ concerns the Scenarios
    of the games, and getting you through them.  The first section will just
    be a Quick Scenario Reference, and the second, third, and fourth sections
    will contain slightly more elaborate walkthroughs/guides for each of the
    many scenarios contained in the three RollerCoaster Tycoon games.

   Tips:  Katie's World is extremely rainy, and as such it needs indoor rides.
          Also, it has the first completely underground ride, a rollercoaster.
Dinky Park          4G,2E     $10k    $10k, 2yrs    BCIMSSiSmSsSuUVWmW   * L C
   Tips:  You need to expand this ultra-small park quickly, by buying land
          across the street.  You get to that area via construction rights on 
          the street.
Aqua Park           5E        $10k    900g, 3yrs    -- ALL --            *
   Tips:  The waterslide here often "stalled out" on me, consider replacing it
          or redesigning it.  Or barring that remove the Maximum Wait time, and
          have it always "waiting for full load".

          replacing them with new ones.

   Tips:  Ivory Towers has been heavily vandalized and is rather filthy.  Clean
          it up first.

  Note: Whenever you pass a scenario, all the guests in your park will applaud,
        and also they will all let go of their balloons.  Which means that they
        have to buy NEW balloons, so you get twice the balloon money!  Of course
        you've already passed the scenario by that point...

Having trouble passing a scenario?  Check the Common Problems Section below for
tips on how to increase Park Value and other ideas.

  Note:  The game year starts in March and Ends in October (8 months)

  Note:  Save every scenario after you beat it.  (see the Bugs Section for more
         info)

  Note:  Not every scenario has every ride in it (unless you cheat).

You may be looking at the scenario names thinking to yourself, "I never saw that
Scenario."  Well I have the US version of the game, and the other International
versions have different names.  Here's a little comparison:

Whispering Cliffs     --    $10k   $17k, 3yrs   SfVrWWmWsSmMUSuV
   Tips:  Space is at a premium here as you have very little space to work with.
          So what I would do is to build the smallest flat rides on the ground,
          then raise a piece of land 4 squares and build another ride on that.
          (see the Your Park section for more information)  Also have your
          coasters start at the top of the cliff, and go down the cliff to the
          water to save space.

Barony Bridge         --    $10k   1200g, 3yrs  WWtWsMCSuISsBV
   Tips:  This park is very difficult to develop as you only have two small
          (and I do mean SMALL) islands that you actually own.  But you have
          construction rights all around the bridge.  So when you want to build
          something, simply place it somewhere, and it will automatically be
          placed above the water.  However, placing anything on stilts costs a
          little more.

   Tips:  You can't build above "tree height" which means 8 levels vertically.
          Also you can't remove trees either.  So for best coaster effect, start
          at the top of the hill, and run down the hill.

   Tips:  This park is a mess of vandalism, broken rides, and rides that seem
          to have lost most of their tracks!  Clean it up and rebuild.
Fiasco Forest       2G,2C,E $1k    900g, 1yr    WWmSmSISsBH                *
   Tips:  This park is going to kill someone with its dangerous rides.  Either
          fix or replace these deathtraps before people get hurt (and before the
          year ends as well!).
Pickle Park           --    $10k   1400g, 3yrs  VrWTWmWsSmMUCStSuISsB      *
   Tips:  Here the trick is that you can't advertise, you simply must get guests
          going home happy to get a good reputation.

Coaster Crazy         --    $10k   see below     -- all coasters --        *
   Tips:  This one has the most unique winning requirements of all, you must
          have 10 DIFFERENT types of rollercoasters in your park, each with at
          least 6 excitement.  Hopefully by now you know how to build good
          coasters...  By the way, you have unlimited time to do this.

1.2.1  Forest Frontiers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Deep in the Forest, build a thriving theme park in a large cleared area."

Initial Admission             Initial Cash    Initial # of guests
--------------------------    ------------    -------------------
FREE (You can change this)    $10,000                 0

Victory Conditions:  To have at least 250 guests in your park at the end of 
                     October Year 1 with a park rating of at least 600.

Current Rides: None

Map Layout:  This is a completely flat terrain with a scattering of pine trees 
             around the edges.  There is some land available for purchase just 
             north of the entrance (assuming the entrance is on the west side 
             of the park.  There is a large stretch of land, on the southern 
             side of the park, also available for purchase.  The only 
             construction that has happened prior to the scenario beginning is 
             a short path at the park entrance.

Strategies for Winning: (from Water Monkey)
             
             This is a simple scenario to beat aimed at getting you exposure to 
             the game.  Don't worry about expanding the park until after you 
             have won the scenario.  The quick way to beat this scenario is to 
             research only rollercoasters until you get a steel coaster.

             While you are waiting for the research to be completed, build all 
             the rides that are currently available.  If you are planning to 
             play this scenario a long time then don't conserve space.  Spread 
             you rides out a little.  This will give your peeps more room to 
             walk.

             Once your research of steel coasters is done, change your research 
             back to all and begin constructing your steel coaster.  Hopefully, 
             you have already built the steel mini coaster, so your peeps 
             aren't completely bored.

1.2.2  Dynamite Dunes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Built in the middle of the desert, this theme park contains just one roller 
coaster but has space for expansion."

Initial Admission      Initial Cash      Initial # of guests     Max. Loan Amt.
-----------------      ------------      -------------------     --------------
      FREE                $10,000                 84               $15,000

Victory Conditions: To have at least 650 guests in your park at the end of 
                    October, Year 3, with a park rating at least 600.

Current Rides: Mine Train Coaster (Dynamite Blast) - NEW - $3.00 Admission

Map Layout:  This is a desert scenario with a couple of large hills and one 
             small hill. The land is bare except for some palm trees at the 
             entrance and a handful of cactus towards the back end of the park.
             The park is a medium sized park with a lot of land for sale along
             the backside boundaries.

Strategies for Winning: (from Water Monkey)

             This is another easy scenario to complete.  The object is to build 
             as much as possible.  Go ahead and build the three gentle ride and 
             one thrill ride available to you at the beginning of the scenario.  
             This will give your peeps some rides to enjoy.

             Once those rides are built, its time to give "Dynamite Blaster" an
             overhaul.  With an intensity rating of 8.18 not many peeps are 
             going to be willing to board your ride.  Play with the design 
             while you are waiting for new rides to be researched.  One option 
             is to demolish the coaster and rebuild.  You will get about $8,000 
             for the coaster and you may be able to build a better coaster for 
             less.

             One of the key to success in this scenario is making good use of 
             the hills provided.  The excitement rating of coasters goes up 
             quickly when you use tunnels and underground track designs.

             Another thing, don't worry about purchasing any land.  You have 
             plenty to complete the scenario.  If you want to watch your park 
             grow, go ahead and purchase land once the scenario is completed.  
             Be careful, buying land can quickly add up, and you don't have 
             much money to play with.

1.2.3  Leafy Lake
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Starting from scratch, build a theme park around a large lake."

Initial Admission       Initial Cash     Initial # of guests     Max. Loan Amt.
-----------------       ------------     -------------------     --------------
FREE                       $10,000               0                  $50,000

Victory Conditions:  To have at least 500 guests in your park at the end of 
                     October, Year 3, with a park rating of at least 600.

Current Rides: None

Map Layout:  This is a large grassy park with a lot of trees set around a large
             lake.  A dirt path has been built to circle the lake.  Almost 
             every side of the park has some squares for sale, allowing you to 
             expand your park even further.  The back half of the park is 
             divided from the front half by a plateau.  Trees are abundant.  
             You will need to cut down some in order to build any coasters.

Strategies for winning: (from Water Monkey)

             The idea behind this scenario is to give you the freedom to create 
             a large park without the concern of money or land.  With a maximum 
             loan amount of $50,000 you won't be hurting for cash anytime soon 
             (unless you try to re-slope all the land).  Start building your 
             rides around the lake.  Since you have so much cash available, I 
             would buy some of the land at the front end of the park now so you 
             can build on it right away.

             Like Dynamite Dunes, keep building rides.  The more rides you 
             have, the quicker the peeps will come.  This is an excellent 
             scenario to practice your coaster building.  See what the effects 
             of water are on a coaster.  Also, if you haven't tried it yet, 
             test the effects of coasters interacting with themselves and other
             coasters.  Try running some track through the vertical loop on a 
             steel coaster.

             The only thing to be careful of is the path circling the lake.  If 
             you plan to start building at the front half of the lake, or on 
             just one side initially, then think of placing "Do Not Enter" 
             banners where you don't want the peeps to go.  If given the 
             choice, your peeps will wander the whole path aimlessly and not 
             spending their hard earned "peep dollars" on your rides.

               Wooden Crazy Coaster (Roller Coaster 1) - 2 years old - $5.00

Map Layout:  This is a large map that that spans across a river.  While there 
             are a number of rides already built, there is still room for 
             growth.  There are numerous paths laid out and the Railroad 
             provides transportation to the back end of the park.  This forest 
             setting has many trees to deal with along with many slopes.

Strategies for Winning:  

             Here's a new challenge.  We no longer care about the number of 
             guests in the park (indirectly we do; more guest more money), just 
             the park value.  Park Value is the current value of all the rides 
             and shops in your park.  The more you build, the higher the park 
             value.  The park value decreases over time as rides get older.

             The rides that increases park value the most are coasters.  
             Unfortunately, you cant build a park of only coasters, because 
             some peeps won't ride them.  Your first year should be about 
             gaining money.  Get as much as possible, you'll need it to build 
             the coasters.  Also, in your first year you should think about 
             modifying the existing coasters because their intensities are a 
             little high.

             The Wooden Crazy Coaster is 3 years old. A neat trick to 
             increasing its value is to save the track design, demolish the 
             ride, and then rebuild the identical ride (from your saved rides)  
             this will give your park value a boost of about $2000.  This might
             be helpful at the end of the scenario, if you are just short of 
             your goal.

             One of the keys to Park Value is that a ride must complete one 
             circuit before its value can be calculated.  So laying coaster 
             track randomly in the park is not only ugly, but won't help.

             The admission prices on the rides are high, while the park 
             admission is free.  You will need to experiment with a balance of 
             park fees and ride fees to determine what will bring you the most
             cash.  I like to balance the two; a park fee between $40.00 - 
             $60.00 (for larger parks) with rides ranging from free (gentle 
             rides) - $2.50 (exciting coasters).

             Also your park is fully functional, except for employees and 
             shops.  I like to pause the game immediately and take care of this 
             right away.  While the game is paused I hire my employees and lay 
             out their territories.  I prefer laying out territories to letting 
             the employees run around randomly.  Remember to uncheck "mow
             grass" on your handymen.  Unless you are totally anal about weeds, 
             you don't need to mow (this will keep your handymen free to do 
             more important things like sweep paths and empty litter bins).

             Place some shops now because your peeps will get thirsty and 
             hungry.  You don't want to have to stop ride construction later 
             when the game tells you your guest are getting hungry/thirsty.

1.2.5  Evergreen Gardens                                    (from Water Monkey)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Convert the beautiful Evergreen Gardens into a thriving theme park"

Objective: To have at least 1000 guests in your park at the end of October, 
           Year 4, with a park rating of at least 600

Initial Admission      Initial Cash      Initial # of guests     Max. Loan Amt.

     $1.00                $10,000                1                   $40,000

Victory Conditions: To have at least 1000 guests in your park at the end of 
                    October, Year 4, with a park rating of at least 600.

Current Rides: None

Map Layout: Evergreen Gardens is a large park with a lake in the center. It has
            already been populated with various trees and flowers.  There are
            many paths winding through orchards, over hills, and around
            statues.  It is a very peaceful setting.  This is the largest map
            of the first five scenarios.

Strategies for winning:
          
            This scenario is as relaxing as its setting.  While initially it 
            may seem difficult to get 1000 guests in three years, it really 
            isn't.  This is what I call a "practice scenario" (like some of the 
            earlier scenarios).  You are given ample money and land to build 
            the park of your dreams.  Before you build your first ride, pause 
            the game and take a look around.  Get some ideas how you would like 
            to use the landscape.  You will need to decide if you are going to 
            use most of the current landscape, or if you will be changing it.  
            Just remember that altering the land can be expensive.

            With so much room to build and paths already set up, it may be 
            difficult to decide where to start.  I usually start one of two 
            ways:

            My typical method of starting is to not build anything along the 
            entrance walkway until you get past the first two hills.  In this 
            flat area is where I place a few gentle rides and thrill rides.  I 
            usually save the hill with the Roman themeing on it for some type
            of coaster.

            An alternative to starting this way is to build a few gentle and 
            thrill rides on top of the Roman themed hill and allow th peeps to
            walk down the backside of the hill into a park filled with more 
            exciting rides.

            Whatever way you design your park, the first thing I would do is 
            place "Do Not Enter" signs on paths leading to areas of the park 
            you currently aren't using.  There are so many paths that your 
            peeps will get lost, hungry, and tired.  You will get messages 
            telling you your guests are getting lost.  As your park grows you 
            can take away some of the signs and allow your peeps more freedom.

              Note:  If you don't HAVE banners, then you can't place these
                     signs. (Corkscrew Follies)  In that case, just delete the
                     paths.

            Also, be thinking early on about a transport ride.  It is a good 
            idea to have a monorail that takes the peeps to different points in
            the park.  I usually do not build any rides within two squares on 
            the park boundaries in order to allow for the monorail track.  You 
            can build the monorail at the beginning of the game and only have 
            one stop.  Then as the park grows you can add additional stops.  I 
            usually have four stops centrally located on each of the four sides 
            of the park.

"Develop Bumbly Beach's small amusement park into a thriving theme park"

Objective: To have at least 750 guest in your park at the end of October, year

               Wooden Coaster (Rollercoaster 1) - New - $4.00 admission

Map Layout:  A pretty nice park no grass cut, a medium wooden rollercoaster a
             wonderful beach side by the park, no flowers or statues (no 
             landscaping) and no trees.  There is land for sale on the beach 
             side.

Strategies for winning: 

             The key to Bumbly Beach is building.  You have a fairly flat piece
             of land that should be easy to develop.  The wooden coaster seems 
             to make your peeps sick.  Consider removing a couple of humps and
             you should be okay.  Practice your coaster construction skills, 
             you will need them in later scenarios.  Try building small compact 
             coasters and large long ones also.

             There is no landscaping currently.  Try adding some flowers and 
             trees and see how that affects coasters and your park rating.

1.2.7  Trinity Islands                                      (from Water Monkey)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Several islands form the basis for this new park"

Objective: To have at least 750 guest in your park at the end of October, year 
           3, with a park rating of at least 600.

Initial Admission      Initial Cash      Initial # of guests     Max. Loan Amt.

      FREE                $10,000                0                   $20,000

Current Rides: None

Map Layout:  Three islands make up the land available for this park.  Being 
             islands there is plenty of water surrounding them.  The islands 
             are hilly.  Increasing in steepness from the first (least steep)
             to the other two (more steep). There are a fair amount of trees on 
             the islands. Some paths have been built to connect the islands.

Strategies for winning:  

             While the objective of this scenario may be to get 750 guests in 
             your park, the true goal of this scenario is to teach you how to 
             build on various landscapes.  With this scenario you will be able 
             to practice your skills of building rides over water and on 
             hillsides.

             I found the easiest way to complete this scenario is to place your 
             flat rides along the level area of the first island and build your 
             track and water rides along the hilly portions of the islands.

             Remember to use the hills to increase the excitement of your 
             coasters.  You can tunnel through them and running your track near 
             ground level increases the perception of speed, which increases 
             excitement.  Try creating a coaster that approaches an island at 
             sea level (at a high speed) and then run the track up the side of 
             an island, your peeps will love this.

             Use the trees to your advantage.  They raise your park rating and 
             also increase the perception of speed when placed next to a track.

             Some things to look out for:

             A. Money:  This is one of those scenarios that if you are not 
             careful, you could run out of cash in the middle of creating a 
             coaster (very upsetting).

             B. Boat Hire:  I tend to create Boat Hires without any boundaries.  
             This allows my peeps to row wherever they like.  Unfortunately, 
             with this scenario, they will row wherever they like.  If I don't
             put up some kind of land barrier around the boat hire area, I find 
             my peeps rowing past the park boundaries.  The problem happens 
             when they try to row back, the game won't let them back into the 
             park.  You eventually will get a message telling you that a boat 
             has not returned.  At this point you must pause the game, 
             double-click on the "close" button for the ride, open the ride, 
             and then unpause the game.  Not a major crisis, but a hassle to do
             every 10-15min.

Map Layout:  This is a hilly forest setting.  A small lake is set toward the 
             middle of the park. There is  land for sale in the center of the 
             mine train coaster and along the front side of the park.  Rides 
             and pathways have been scattered around the park.

Strategies for winning: 

             The simple way to increase your park value is to build.  The more 
             you build the higher your Park Value becomes.  Roller coasters 
             raise the Park Value the most. Remember as your rides age they 
             decrease in value.  Also, for a ride to increase you Park Value, 
             it must complete one full circuit.

             One strategy I like to use is building saved coasters.  I usually 
             build some rides to attract more guests, including a couple of 
             coasters that don't take up a lot of room.  Then I start saving my
             money.  In the last year, I usually build 3 - 4 coasters and then 
             let the scenario finish.

               Swinging Ship (Swinging Ship 1) - NEW - $1.50 admission

Map Layout:  This is a tiny park set on a small hillside.  All but a couple of 
             trees have been removed.  There is land for purchasing 
             construction rights on the opposite side of the highway.

Strategies for winning:  
 
             Like the previous scenario you need to build to increase your Park 
             Value.  With so little space in the current park, you have no 
             choice but to purchase construction rights to the land on the 
             opposite side of the highway.

             Before I start purchasing construction rights, I usually condense 
             my current park.  The park has a lot of wasted space.  I usually
             move the scrambled eggs, swinging ship and carousel close together 
             near the entrance of the park.  This allows me to build a small 
             steel mini coaster at the back of the park (using tunneling).
             This will add extra income which is needed later in the scenario.

             As the scenario progresses I purchase blocks of construction 
             rights in order to build more coasters.  Small coasters not spread 
             out too much allow you to spend less on construction rights.  
             Remember each new coaster added increases your profits, so money 
             will start to flow quicker as the scenario progresses.

             The other thing I like to to is make all non-coaster rides free 
             and then charge a gate admission.  This will force each peep to 
             give you a certain amount of money upfront, and they are more
             reluctant to leave knowing they will have to pay an admission 
             again.

Map Layout: This is a large forest themed park with plenty of room to expand.  
            There is a large lake in the center of the park and numerous trees 
            around the property.  There is no additional land or property 
            rights for sale.

Strategies for winning:
          
            First thing, pause your game and make a decision about the water 
            slide.  Guests are complaining that the slide is unsafe, and they 
            are right.  If you don't correct this problem immediately, you will 
            start losing peeps as they fly off the slide.

            You have two choices; either make the slide safe or demolish it.  I 
            always demolish the slide.  I don't like the way the slide looks at 
            the front of the park.  I usually place the slide away from the 
            main walkway.  With the slide gone, you can now build flat rides 
            along your main path.

            This is a fairly easy scenario to complete.  Just keep building 
            coasters, raise your park admission, and lower your ride 
            admissions.

Current Rides: Miniature Railroad (Mine Tour Train) - New - Free Admission

Map Layout:  The theme of this park is a large abandoned mine.  The terrain on 
             this scenario is very hilly.  The land type is dirt.  There are no
             trees or grass within the park.  There are a couple of small 
             ponds, but they aren't large enough to use for water rides.

Strategies for Winning:  

             To things to take note of with this park, hills and rain.  The 
             landscape is very uneven and it seems to rain quite a bit 
             (remember peeps don't like to ride outdoor rides in the rain).  
             Don't waste your money trying to flatten all the land.  This is a
             good test of how well you can place rides along hillsides.  Make
             use of the terrain for tunneling your coasters.  Try constructing
             a coaster completely underground.  This way peeps will ride it no 
             matter what the weather is like.

             I like to keep with the mine themeing throughout the park, except 
             I usually create a garden in the center of the park with some 
             gentle rides placed in there.

Map Layout:  This is a heavily wooded area with several hills.  There are 
             several paths that wind around the park and the rides twist and 
             turn between the trees.

Strategies for winning: 

             First thing, demolish some rides.  You don't need 2 wooden 
             coasters and 2 GoKarts.  To save space and gain income I usually
             demolish all four rides.  This will give you an extra $25,000.00.  
             Remember to get rid of the queue lines that aren't being used.

             Build some gentle and thrill rides quickly, to keep your peeps 
             happy.  Once you have some rides built, get rid of some of the 
             paths.  Your peeps will start getting lost if you don't guide them 
             properly.

             You are also going to need to thin out some trees in order to 
             build your rides.  So be thinking about ride placement and which 
             trees you want to get rid of.

Map Layout:  Mel's World is a medium sized park set on rolling grass hills.
             There is a small lake available for use with some water rides.  
             There are some trees scattered along the hillsides, but not as
             dense as previous scenarios.  Pathways have been built to allow 
             access to the existing rides.  There is no land for sale.

Strategies for winning:  

             Okay now your park management skills are going to be tested.  You
             have limited amounts of cash to work with ($15,000 total), and a 
             park design that is currently spread out.  Most of your gentle and 
             thrill rides will need to be built on slopes, so plan carefully.

             If you find yourself running short of land there are a couple of
             things you can do.  First you can build some of your coasters 
             underground, this will save space.  Second, you can place rides 
             close together and have them share exit paths.  For instance, I 
             managed to squeeze 6 gentle/thrill rides into the empty land in 
             front of "Quiver".  I placed three rides facing the path in front 
             of "Quiver" (with the exits at the back of the rides), and three 
             rides facing the opposite direction directly behind the first 
             three rides.  The entrances (an queues) faced the paths, while the 
             exits were behind the rides.  I then built a path between all of 
             the exits, thus having 6 rides use the same exit path.

             One of the first things you will need to do is decide what to do 
             with "Frightmare".  With an intensity of 11.44 you won't be making
             much money on this one.  Plus the nausea rating is 7.47, so you 
             are going to have a lot of sick peeps wandering around. You can try
             to fix the coaster, making it less intense, or you can demolish it 
             and collect approx. $9,100.  If you decide to fix the ride, be
             careful not to spend too much of your money on this coaster, you
             still have a park to run.

             Since you have several gentle and thrill rides available at the 
             start, I would go ahead and construct them, and then decide what 
             to do about Frightmare.

Current Rides: None

Map Layout:  You own a small piece of land, with the option to expand and 
             enlarge your park.  Set on a mountain, you do not have much flat 
             land.  There is a body of water in the center of your park.  The 
             trees are densely packed in areas around your park.  There is also 
             an abandoned shack at the back of your park.

Strategies for winning:  

             At first 800 guests in 3 years seems simple.  Even with only 
             $15,000 to play with this scenario seems like a breeze.  The 
             problem is, if you are use to constructing "wide open" parks you 
             will have to "rethink" your construction strategies.

             Building your rides close together is one key to success in this 
             park.  Another is to build small, tight, but exciting coasters.  
             This may take some practice, but it can be done.  As you generate 
             money, you need to think about two things; adding more rides and 
             expanding your park.  This means you need to build some cash 
             generating rides (shuttle loop coasters) early on and spend your 
             money wisely.  Don't raise/lower any land unless you absolutely
             have to, its too expensive.

Current Rides: None

Map Layout: This is an Egyptian themed park.  Currently you own a good size 
            park, with the ability to purchase massive amounts of land for 
            expansion.  The land is flat, except for a range of hills running 
            through the middle of your park.  There are four pyramids at the 
            front of the park and some Egyptian artifacts toward the rear.  A
            network of paths (including a subterranean path) has been laid for
            you.

Strategies for winning:  

            First off, you need to decide if you want to keep all of the 
            themeing.  The four pyramids in the front of the park can get in 
            your way.  If you decide to remove one or more of them, consider 
            redirecting your paths at the same time.  The underground path can 
            be a hassle because peeps can still get sick on it, and it can be 
            difficult to set your handyman's paths accurately.  Also, the
            underground path can become an obstacle if you plan to utilize the 
            hill for a coaster.

            It should be no problem to reach your goal of 1000 in four years.  
            You can make this scenario more fun by adding even more themeing.  
            Expand as you gain wealth.  I would suggest expanding one side of 
            the park first, then once you have expanded one side fully, move to
            the other side.

Map Layout:  Crumbly Woods is a park set in a dense hilly forest.  It has 
             several rides nestled in a dense forest.  There is a small body of 
             water in the park, that may be of some use.  There is no land for 
             sale.

Strategies for winning:  

             My strategy for this scenario is to demolish all the rides and
             rebuild. Demolishing the rides will give you an extra $20k, which
             will help you complete this scenario.  The old rides are a hassle 
             because they always breakdown.  Don't worry if peeps leave because 
             they are bored, more will come.

1.2.17  Big Pier                                            (from Water Monkey)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Convert this sleepy town's pier into a thriving attraction"

Objective: To have at least 600 guests in your park at the end of October, Year 
           2, with a park rating of at least 600

Initial Admission      Initial Cash      Initial # of guests     Max. Loan Amt.

     Free                 $10,000                 0                $20,000

Current Rides: None

Map Layout:  As the name implies this is a big pier.  There is no land, just 
             water.  You can build rides in the pier boundaries out to 4 
             squares away from the pier.

Strategies for winning: 

             Design short rides that don't take up much space.  You don't have 
             the time to spend a year developing a coaster.  If you want to 
             build a large coaster, try designing a coaster that you can save, 
             and then restart the scenario and build it instantly.  Don't worry 
             about building on the water.  All your rides start at the same 
             level as the pier.

             I like to build as many gentle and thrill rides as possible, 
             because they are compact.  If you are not concerned about 
             admission to the rides, you can create multiple copies of the 
             same ride (e.g. 4 swinging ships) and the peeps won't be upset.  I 
             once created 4 copies of each of my rides (none were coasters) and 
             placed one copy in each of the pier quadrants and I had no problem 
             getting my 600 peeps.

sightseers - Use the available land to attract a new thrill seeking clientele"

Current Rides: Chairlift (Chairlift 1)- New - $1.50 admission
               Chairlift (Chairlift 2)- New - $1.50 admission

Map Layout: By now you are probably hoping for a scenario with nice flat land 
            and very little trees,  well sorry to disappoint you, but this 
            isn't it.  Lightning Peaks is a giant mountain with two chairlifts
            and several paths traversing the mountain sides. There are trees 
            everywhere and almost no flat land.

Strategies for winning:  

            There isn't anything too difficult about this scenario.  Basically, 
            you need to create a few rides that interact with the mountains 
            (tunnels etc.) Make the chairlfts free, so they get more use, and
            install plenty of info kiosks, it rains a lot. If you want some
            quick cash create a "shuttle loop" style steel coaster.  Once you 
            have enough cash to build a large coaster, build it toward the back 
            of the park.  Then all you need are your gentle/thrill rides and 
            you should be done.

                Steel Mini Coaster (Tree Topper) - 2 years  - $3.50 admission

Map Layout:  Ivory Towers is a park set on the banks of a small lake.  There 
             are many trees to deal with along with the lake.  The paths are 
             laid out for you and some nice hooligans have vandalized, littered 
             and barfed all over your paths.

Strategies for winning:  

             Obviously the first task is to clean up the mess.  It is up to you 
             whether you set a patrol area for each of your staff members.  I 
             like to, just to be more efficient.  Once that is done consider 
             demolishing or re-designing "Force Nine".  This coaster is making
             everyone sick.  I would even consider re-designing "Tree Topper"
             in order to free up some more space.

             After that just start building and you should be done.  This is 
             another rainy scenario.  So sell those umbrellas and build some 
             underground rides.

1.2.20  Rainbow Valley                                      (from Water Monkey)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Rainbow Valley's local authority won't allow any landscape changes or large 
tree removal, but you must develop the area into a large theme park"

Objective: To have at least 1000 guests in your park at the end of October, 
           Year 4, with a park rating of at least 600.

Initial Admission      Initial Cash      Initial # of guests     Max. Loan Amt.

Current Rides: None

Map Layout:  A long narrow valley with a river at the bottom is the setting for 
             this scenario.  You can develop along both sides of the river, as 
             long as you don't remove any trees or adjust land height.  There 
             is no land for sale.

Strategies for winning: 

             Okay some eco-nut is trying to prevent you from building your
             "perfect" park.  You are prevented from cutting down trees and 
             raising or lowering the land.  Once you stop swearing at your 
             computer, there are tips you can use to complete the scenario.

             First, pause the game and look over the whole area.  Make note of 
             any areas with few or no trees.  Take special note of any long 
             strips of land where trees are absent, these are places to place 
             station platforms for your coasters.

             Building flat rides should not be too difficult, just find spaces 
             between the trees and place these rides there.  Try to save the 
             more open areas for your coasters.  The flat rides can be crammed 
             into tight areas.  For example, you might see an area where there 
             is two squares vacant between a couple of trees, this may be 
             perfect for a spiral slide.

             Coasters may be a little trickier than flat rides.  The hardest 
             part of your coaster construction will be finding an area to place 
             your station platform and have enough room for your lift hill to 
             clear the trees.  Make sure your station has plenty of space in 
             the back for your coaster to enter.  You don't want to create the 
             perfect coaster only to realize a tree is blocking your track from 
             completing the circuit.

             One trick to coaster building you can use, is the elevated 
             platform.  Unfortunately RCT doesn't allow to just pick the height 
             of the platform, you will have to do some creative building.

             1. Start your track at ground level.
             2. Incline the track to the height you want your station to be, 
                and level the track.
             3. Determine where you want the station to be placed and build 
                track until you are at that location.
             4. Once you are at the spot where you want your station, build a 
                few station squares.
             5. This is the beginning of your coaster.  All you have to do now 
                is demolish all the track leading up to the station and you 
                will be set to create your coaster.  This is also the method 
                for creating double decker coasters (One platform over
                another).

             This might sound tricky, but give it a try.

             You can build rides on the river, but usually save that area for 
             coaster track.

1.2.21  Thunder Rock                                        (from Water Monkey)

"Thunder Rock stands in the middle of the desert and attracts many tourists - 
Use the available space to build rides to attract more people."

Objective: To have at least 900 guests in your park at the end of October, Year

Current Rides: Chairlift (Thunder Rock Chairlift) - New - $1.00 admission

Map Layout:  Just like the name implies, you park is a giant rock. The rock 
             towers over your park entrance (the entrance is at height 1, the 
             average height of the rock is 23-25).  A path has been constructed 
             to lead peeps to the top of the rock and along the perimeter of 
             the top.  The chairlift will also provide access to the top of the
             rock.

Strategies for winning:  

             This is it, the final scenario in the original RCT game.  You will 
             need all of your expert design skills for this one.  Your park 
             area is small, but if you think in layers you can expand the area 
             quite nicely.  Design your coasters to utilize the rock.  Send 
             them underground, and keep your peeps guessing where the coaster 
             goes.  Put most of your flat rides on top.  I usually get rid of 
             the chairlift, because it doesn't utilize its space very well.

             You can build some rides at entrance level, but be careful.  This 
             is a great way to get your peeps lost.  With too many rides at 
             entrance level and then more at the top of the rock, peeps will 
             have a hard time finding the rides.

             Another cool ride to create is what I call a transport coaster.  
             This is a coaster (usually steel or corkscrew) that has multiple 
             platforms along the park.  Its purpose is to transport peeps 
             quickly to another area of the park.  My favorite is to use a 
             steel coaster with boosters to send peeps to the top, backside of
             the rock, where they disembark.  At that point new peeps board the
             coaster and are wisked to the entrance at break-neck speeds.  This
             moves more peeps than the chairlift or monorail (over time), and
             the peeps are willing to pay more for it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.4 Loopy Landscapes Scenario Walkthroughs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A semi-brief note on the Loopy Landscape scenarios.  Almost without fail, 
    all of these scenarios do not allow you to set admission to the park 
    prices.  Which means that ALL of your funding must come primarily from 
    Rides and secondarily from Shops.  A good rule on pricing the rides is to 
    simply keep the price that is automatically generated when you build the 
    ride.  Do this for gentle rides, etc.; but for rollercoasters you are going 
    to want to increase the prices well into the $4 and $5 dollar range.  
    Remember, as with earlier, that you still don't want to price gouge.  You 
    need to get all your guest's money, maximize the time they spend in the 
    park, AND get them to leave happy.  You won't get all three if you ask the
    peeps to pay $10 per ride (even if they pay it).

    Justification:  Guests normally like to stay in the park between 1 and 2
    hours real time.  After that point, they usually want to go home,
    regardless of how much money they currently have, or how happy they are.
    This gives you a 1.5 hour window to get all of that guest's money.  If you
    price your rides entirely too high (such as $10) then you are severely
    limiting the amount of time they can spend in the park.  If they ride an
    expensive ride repeatedly, they could end out with no money really quickly,
    and spend the rest of their 1.5 hours wandering around the park looking
    for cheap rides.  As they do this, their happiness drops, and they leave
    when it hits "miserable" (usually well before the normal 1.5 hour mark).
    The result could be that you get less guests coming to your park (bad
    word of mouth) and you have less guests in your park (they all get mad and
    leave).  It could also negatively impact your park rating.

Victory Conditions: To have at least 1250 guest in your park at the end of
                    October, Year 3, with a park rating of at least 600.

               Bobsled Coaster (Roller Coaster 1) - NEW - Free Admission

Map Layout: There are a half-dozen icebergs floating in the middle of a cold
            ocean.  To reach each one, you must either make paths, or use
            a Transport Ride (Chairlift, for example).

Strategies for Winning:

            This scenario is a little more difficult than I first imagined.  
            The first thing that annoyed me was the fact that you can't charge 
            a Gate Fee.  This meant you had to spend your $10,000 very wisely.

            Another bad thing is the fact that you're on icebergs, which meant 
            nothing was touching each other.  You also have to spend quite a 
            bit of money on paths to connect the icebergs to get your guests 
            from one "berg" to another.  One logical solution would to raise 
            the land with the Land Tool.  This, however is very expensive to 
            do, especially if you want a flat "berg."  It is interesting to
            note that several of the icebergs come "prelinked" via underground
            pathways.

            Be sure to change the Admission fees for your three initial rides, 
            as this is the only way you'll be making any money.

            With all of that water sitting there, you'd be a fool not to put at 
            least one type of a water ride there.

            I'm afraid patience is the only thing that will get you through 
            your first mission, unless of course you're using a trainer.

Tips from Others: "Build as LESS as you can in water because the ground is way
                  down there and it costs too much for supports.  Also, charge
                  as much as you can for rides, shops, etc. without upsetting
                  your guests."    - Chris The Cool

                  "Another logical thing to do to connect the icebergs is to
                  make a couple of boat hires, each with ONE CANOE and a
                  station on both icebergs.  Make them very cheap and people
                  can row themselves from iceberg to iceberg, boat hires aren't
                  too expensive."   - The Beetles Fan

                    coasters in this park, designing them to achieve excitement
                    ratings of at least 6.70 each.

               Suspended Coaster (Roller Coaster 4) - Incomplete
               Steel Wild Rodent (Roller Coaster 5) - Incomplete

Map Layout:  A large volcanic island in the middle of the ocean.  The
             "cauldron" of the volcano has been filled with water.  The five
             rollercoasters that must be completed are thrown all over the
             place (make sure you know where each end of the coaster is!),
             but concentrated in the rear of the park.

Strategies for Winning:

             There is NO time limit on this park, so you can take all the time
             you want.  This changes this scenario from being a park building
             scenario into a coaster building excercise.  If you feel a little
             inadequate in the coaster construction element of this game, you
             will find this scenario particularly taxing.  You CANNOT delete
             any of the existing track on any of the 5 coasters.

             Don't feel up to it?  Try playing "Arid Heights" first as it
             has NO money at all (everything is free), and can give you great
             practice at coaster building.

             First things first, develop a small "mini-park" of various rides
             to give your park some cashflow.  Zoom out the map all the way
             and look at the park.  With the entrance in the bottom right
             corner, you will notice the 5 unfinished coasters at the top of
             the park, with most of the open space at the bottom.  That is
             where we want to develop right now.  Build gentle rides, shops
             and whatnot first.  Then along the lower left side I built my
             favorite of all money-making rides, the Shuttle Loop Steel
             Coaster.  Build the first at least 3 squares from the path, give
             it 4 or 5 station platforms, a quickie loop (in the direction of
             the path, so if the path is to the right, do a right loop), a
             picture platform, a loop in the opposite direction, and a very
             long and high straight track.  Then build another of these right
             next to the first so that you can synchronize the two.  I have
             found this combination of coasters to be one of the most efficient
             money makers.

             Continue developing the mini-park until you make around $3,000 to
             $4,000 in profit a month (without taking into account Construction
             costs or landscaping, you would make $4,000).  That is about the
             needed amount of cashflow to develop the 5 coasters without having
             to resort to a loan.  Work on the 5 coasters one at a time, and
             get them up, running and profitable as soon as possible.  Which to
             do first?  Here's a decent idea:

               Steel
               Wooden (or this could be first)
               Steel Wild Rodent
               Inverted
               Suspended

             Coasters under the 6.7 excitement?  Try sending them through
             more tunnels (they all already go through some tunnels), build 
             lots of scenery around them, send the rides through each other
             (such as going through the loop), etc.

             One last tip:  Pay off your debt.  There's no telling how long
             you are going to play this scenario (as it isn't timed) and even
             at the very very low interest rates this game features, you will
             lose some needed funds to debt.

FREE (permanent)            n/a                   0                    n/a


Victory Conditions: To have at least 2000 guests in your park.  You must not
                    let the park rating fall below 700 at any time.

Current Rides:  none

Map Layout:  A very large, reasonably flat, desert park.  There is some small
             bit of landscaping around (water, greenery and a scattering of
             trees) but on the whole, this is the perfect park for developing.

Strategies for Winning:

             Arid Heights is the easiest scenario ever designed, I believe.
             There is simply put, no money at all.  Nothing costs anything, and
             every guest gets on all the rides for free.  Want to build a huge
             colossal coaster?  Why not?  You don't have to worry about how to
             finance it at all!  Just keep building rides until you get your
             2000 guests.  And while you are playing, try to improve your
             coaster-building skills.  No better time for it.

             Just remember that the park rating can't fall below 700 or you
             lose.  So hire as many handymen as you can to keep the paths
             clean, and remember to check for vandalism.

Victory Conditions: To have 10 different types of roller coasters operating in
                    your park, each with an excitement value of at least 6.00.

Current Rides:  none

Map Layout:  Another very large park, that would be nice and flat if it didn't
             have numerous large "boulders" around the park.  Each of these
             is a small mountain really.  These could be useful to making some
             rollercoasters.

Strategies for Winning:

             First things first, build a small "mini-park" to get the money
             rolling in so that you can start working on your 10 coasters.
             Think 10 6.0 excitement coasters sounds tough?  Not really.  Your
             coaster doesn't need to have any passengers, merely needs to be
             tested at above 6.0 excitement.  You can probably get by just
             through using the Pre-Built coasters and just adding scenery where
             applicable.

             Here are the 10 coasters I built, and how I got them over 6.0
             excitement:

             1)  Steel Mini:  Raging Rocket.  Normally this ride doesn't get
                 6.0 excitement, so I had to make some changes.  I removed
                 sections of track, raised the land, then replaced the track
                 to create little tunnels.  Then I build an astounding number
                 of scenery around the ride filling every square around the
                 ride with objects going out 3 squares. (6.06 excitement)

             2)  Wild Rodent:  Crazy Vole.  This ride already has over 6.0
                 excitement (around 6.4), however, I still redesign it slightly
                 by making a drop out of the station, then through a tunnel
                 and over to the lift hill.

             3)  Air Powered Verticle Coaster:  Custom.  This is my favorite
                 new ride in LL, and it is the easiest coaster to design, even
                 if it is horridly expensive.  You send the track out 
                 vertically as in the Reverse Whoa Belly (Freefall), then a
                 rounded out top, then vertically down.  The track then curves
                 around, then again and back to the station.  Some scenery
                 (and nearness to other rides) gave this a 9.3 excitement.

             4)  Wooden Twister:  Wooden_Twister_1.  This is a great ride and
                 the pre-made coaster is really well made.  Very little work
                 needs to be done.  (6.3 excitement)

             5)  Bobsled:  Big Bob.  This ride comes VERY close (5.4) already
                 so you just need to make some adjustments.  Remove sections
                 of track, raise the land, then restore the track to create
                 tunneled sections, then pile on the scenery. (6.24 excitement)

             6)  Vertical:  Big 90.  This ride comes pretty well designed
                 already at about 6.10 excitement.  To be on the safe side I
                 added more scenery anyway and got it up to 6.7 excitement.

             7)  Steel Wild Mouse:  Steel Mouse 2.  Another great predesigned
                 coaster that requires no real work on your part.  I, however,
                 just got the Castle scenery and wanted to play around with it
                 and so this ride became a Castle. (7.23 excitement)

             8)  Reverse Whoa Belly:  Custom.  This ride was one of the 
                 toughest ones to get above 6.0 excitement.  First I had to
                 build 2 of them next to each other and synchronize them.  Then
                 I added tunnels all over the place (I was most proud of
                 getting the tunnel on the vertical section), then I hit it
                 hard with scenery everywhere.  I barely got it to 6.10 and
                 was happy.

             9)  Mine Train:  Manic Miner.  This prebuilt coaster comes close
                 to where you need it (5.7), so all you need to do is add
                 tunnels and scenery and be done with it.

             10) Steel Coaster:  Custom.  This was a Shuttle Launch with 2
                 loops and a photo track.  Then I built two by each other,
                 raced them and added tunnels and scenery and got 6.7 
                 excitement.

             I took too long playing this scenario, and around year 7, the
             guests stop arriving.  So, try to win it before then.

Victory Conditions: To have 1300 guests in your park at the end of October,
                    Year 3, with a park rating of at least 600.

Current Rides:  none

Map Layout:  Another very large park, that is taking place over a lake.  The
             most interesting thing about this is that the land is as low as
             it can get, and the water is only 1 level above that.  So unless
             you raise the land, you won't get any tunneling.

Strategies for Winning:

             After those previous "tricky" parks, this one is refreshingly
             normal.  Just build a theme park, nothing complicated about that.
             I built a large "loop" path around the middle of the park, and
             then built 2 of every Thrill ride you get, one on the left side
             of the park another on the right side.  Coasters are still the
             big moneymaker so try to develop at least 6 or 7 of them by the
             end of year 3.

                    $8,000.

Current Rides:  Hyper Coaster (Roller Coaster 1) - New - $6.00 admission

Map Layout:  A great big park with a great big hypercoaster that goes all
             around it.

Strategies for Winning:

             Aside from the obvious "build more rides" there isn't really a
             trick to this scenario.  As you aren't time limited you can take
             your time building your park.  Make sure to set research to Rides
             early on, but don't neglect shops, as they are a good source of
             revenue.

             Also, it took me about 3 months of $8,000 ride sales before the
             game acknowledged that and let me pass.  So, if you don't get it
             right away, keep working at it.

                Roller Coaster 1 - New - $3.70
                Scrambled Eggs 1 - New - $1.00

Map Layout:  That familiar series of walkways over the ocean from the original
             scenarios, now is larger and comes with a prebuilt minipark on it.
             Your park extends 4 squares beyond the outermost walkways.

Strategies for Winning:

             I found this to be one of the easier scenarios around because you
             start with half your job done for you, you have a good 
             rollercoaster to start with (I would expand its Queue, though)
             and a decent park.  Most rides you place will automatically be
             placed on the same level as the walkway (2 above the water), there
             is one exception to this:  Prebuilt coasters, those are built on
             the water itself.

             First order of business is to place Do Not Enter signs around the
             park, first to block off the exit paths from your rides, then to
             restrict access on the walkways to help the peeps from getting
             lost.  Then build in some information booths, and restrooms around
             the park.  Have at least 5 restrooms.  Since you can't expand the
             park outward, you'll probably never need more.  Get research
             pumped up to $400 a month and uncheck the "Scenery" as you have
             nowhere to place scenery.

             Then just build rides and work on the park.  You should end this
             scenario with at least 1400 guests, even if you only moderately
             develop it.  If necessary you can delete walkways in order to
             place larger coasters.  Coasters are the best moneymakers, but
             as soon as you have filled the park with as many as you think you
             can fit, uncheck Coasters in the research and go for Gentle and
             Thrill only.

             If you are still a little short near the end, around August and
             into September, run major advertising campaigns.  It takes longer
             for peeps to arrive in your park, here, as they have longer to
             walk.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Your Park
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This Section deals with how to set up a successful park, and has some other
  great ideas on how to make money in the park.

   - The first thing that you want to do in your new park is to set Research up
     to the maximum funding possible ($400 a month).  If you do not have the
     Information Kiosk available already, then you will want to uncheck all
     research boxes except for "Shops and Stalls".  (Information Kiosk is the
     most useful shop in the game, since it sells both maps and umbrellas)

   - Once you get the Information Kiosk, build it close to the entrance (not
     right by the entrance, but somewhere nearby), as your guests will want a
     map to avoid getting lost (and an umbrella if it rains).  Typically what
     I do here is to build the Information Kiosk on a corner of the first
     intersection, that way everyone has a good chance to buy something when
     they enter the park.
     Note: Don't forget to recheck the research areas back to all areas.  Unless
           you don't mind never getting new rides...

   - Next you will want some rides.  Build a good mix of rides, some gentle,
     some exciting, and of course a rollercoaster.  Place one, and only one,
     rollercoaster by the entrance to get the guests' hearts pounding early.  It
     also increases their happiness.  The rest of your Rollercoasters you will
     build deeper into your park  (you build only one by the entrance since
     they will have to travel to the others, and will sometimes see other things
     on the way).  This is how real amusement parks design their parks in case
     you didn't notice.  You want at least one indoor type ride, like the 
     Haunted House.
     Note: The game sets ride prices if and only if you are letting Guests into
           your park for free.  If you are charging them to get into your park
           then you will have to set the price yourself.  (see sections 3 and 4
           for pricing guidelines)

   - Third, hire one of each type of employee.  Uncheck the handyman's option to
     mow the grass.  You don't need that yet.  (mown grass looks nicer, and
     helps guests happiness ratings, and park value ratings)  When you do want
     someone to mow the grass, hire a handyman specifically for that task, and
     uncheck all but the mow grass option.

   - Fourth, jack up the entrance price to the park to around $15-$20.  You want
     it cheap enough to keep your guests happy, but high enough to get you some
     money.  Generally, for every 4 new rides that you build, add $5 to
     admission.  $10 if one of those rides is a roller coaster.  I'm not saying
     that the only money you get should be from the entrance fee, I still think
     you should also charge them on rides.  This way you can maximize your
     chances of getting all your guests money.

   - Finally you are going to want to build some amenities, such as Bathrooms,
     and shops.  Build these a little further away from the entrance, since
     the guests who enter don't need to use them yet.  Avoid placing food shops
     near the exits of vomit intensive rides--although you can, and possibly
     should, place Drinks stands there.

   Note: Once you get over $30 thousand dollars, you don't need to increase your
         admissions price any more!  I always keep my admissions price around
         $50 at that point.  (the absolute maximum that you can set your
         admission price is $100)

   Banners (Add-On):
     Banners not only work as Signs, but they also work as "Do Not Enter" signs!
     The best ways to use banners are these:
       To block off exit paths (the ones that have nothing but an exit)
       To block off empty areas of the park so you can finish building them
       To tell guests where they are
     Banners can only be placed on normal paths, that is you can't put them on
     sloped paths.  Be very aware of the direction that the banner faces, face
     it the wrong way and you get the wrong results.  For more information on
     banners check out the Landscaping section below.

   Small Area Parks:
     Some parks seem to be too small for you to build a great theme park in, or
     are they?  One of the best ideas in these parks is to literally build rides
     on top of each other.  For example build a Hedge Maze, then raise one
     square of land by it, then build another ride on that square.  Don't worry
     the ride will have supports raising it where you don't have land raised.
     Different rides can have a different height above the land.  Here's a chart
     (provided by Ake Malmgren):

       Height levels:

         The non-custom rides also have maximum height above ground values, but
         they aren't displayed in the game. Here is the list:

         Gentle Rides
           Bumper Cars:       6
           Ferris Wheel:      5
           Haunted House:     6
           Hedge Maze:        4
           Merry-Go-Round:    8
           Observation Tower: 61*
           Slide:             7
           Space Rings:       13
         Exciting Rides
           3D Cinema:         4
           Gravitron:         9
           Motion Simulator:  8
           Scrambled Eggs:    8
           Swinging Ship:     5
           Swinging Inverter: 4
           Whoa Belly:        61*
           Shops and stalls:  8

   Buying Land:
     If you want to expand the park, you can buy land (in the Main Entrance
     window).  Land that is for sale has a little white sign on it, and costs
     between $15 and $90 per square (depending on the Scenario).  Construction
     Rights sell in the same way, but only 2 scenarios let you buy those.
     Other parks come with construction rights already purchased, like Katie's
     World (for the underground coaster) and Mega Park, where you can build a
     ride (or anything else, for that matter) across the path to the entrance.

   Oddity:  You don't need a path that leads immediately from a ride exit. If
            there is a path on a lower level under the exit, the guests will
            fall down and land there without any problems. Of course you will get
            a bunch of messages that says you don't have a path from the exit.
            (Ake Malmgren)

   Common Viewpoint:
     Ever wish that you could visit your wonderful theme park?  Well one way is
     to view a guest just before they enter your park, name them, and click the
     "i" button (the bottom button on the individual guest's window) to receive
     updates on them.  By following around several people like this you can get
     a new viewpoint on your park, and it may help you solve problems that you
     didn't know existed!  If you leave his window open you get to see how long
     a queue wait really is, how hard it is to find a place in the park, and if
     you really have enough facilities like bathrooms or food and drink stalls.

     Note: Naming your peeps with a number first to assist in keeping track of
           the peep.  (i.e. name someone "1 Dan Simpson" or "2 Bob Roberts")
           They will then be listed first in the GUEST MEGA LIST, making them
           much easier to find later.

     Add On Note:  Every once in awhile, the guest that you have been watching
                   for awhile will think "I have the strangest feeling that
                   someone is watching me."  Funny!

   Money Making:
     Remember that you can take a loan.  If you need a new rollercoaster RIGHT
     NOW, then take out an extra $5k or so (keep your loan under $20k total, the
     max loan possible is $50k but you shouldn't need that much; also bear in
     mind that each scenario will allow a different Max Loan).  Also use the
     Rides button (press "R") and slide the marker down to "Profit" to see where
     you are making, and losing money.  If a popular ride isn't making money, it
     may be that you are charging so much for the ride that people won't go on
     it.  You want to get all of their money, but you don't need it all at once,
     so lower the rates.  (see sections 3 and 4 for a pricing guide to rides)

     Later in the game you may want to consider only charging for admission
     (say... $90) and giving the rides away for free, or maybe you want to let
     them in for free and charge them more on rides.  Well there are problems
     with both.  Since your ideal is to get every cent from the guest charging
     $90 at the gate is a problem:  1) what if a guest doesn't have $90? and 2)
     what if the guest has more than $90?  The first guest can't come in, and
     the second will probably leave your park with money. (there's only so many
     ice creams that he can buy!)  Your other option is to let them in for free,
     and charge them more on rides.  This option is even worse.  Here's why:
     Suppose Guest 1 enters your park with $100 and he's happy.  Then he gets in
     a long line for a log flume that was poorly designed (i.e. LONG).  By the
     time he gets off the log flume he is hungry, thirsty and very unhappy.
     Since he didn't pay to get into the park he's getting outta there.  I
     usually stay with the $50 admission and still charge for rides.  I get all
     of their money, and they usually leave only when they run out of money.

   Note: If you click on a duck, it will quack.  Ducks only appear if you have
         water in your park.  I have heard of parks where there are so many
         ducks that it looks like a Hitchcock movie.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1  Queue it up!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   I'll discuss Line Queues here, before I even talk about the rides themselves!
   The first thing to building the ultimate Queue is Ride Placement.  Place the
   ride well away from the nearest path, at least 2 or 3 squares.  This keeps
   the Queue from "attaching" to a path before you are ready.  Then start
   building the Queue, and don't put it near a path until you are satisfied with
   the length.  Only after you have built the entrance Queue to a ride should
   you build the path to the Exit.  So, how long should your Queue be?  That
   depends on the type of ride mainly.  For example, a roller coaster is a very
   popular attraction, PLUS it loads a lot of people at once, PLUS its a short
   ride, and can also have multiple trains.  So for a Rollercoaster build a long
   (10-20 squares) queue line.  Long waits in line are fun for no one, so if
   the "people" tab on the ride window say a queue wait of 10 minutes or more,
   cut the line down.

   Note:  To change the color of the queue (Add-On only) simply click and hold
          down the Queue button in the paths window.  A small choice of colors
          (Blue, Red, Yellow, Green) will appear for you to choose from.

   Here's the breakdown:
     Rollercoasters - 10 to 20 squares
     Exciting Rides - 6 to 15 squares
     Gentle Rides - 5 to 9 squares
     Log Flume - 6 to 9 squares
     Boat Hire - 3 to 5 squares
     Transport Rides - 5 to 15 squares (depending on the type of transport)

   Even if you see a very full line, don't overdo it and make it longer, then
   the people will wait in line a long time, and they will lose a lot of
   happiness; and if the ride isn't so hot (like the Log Flume) they'll have
   been worse off for going on the ride.  Keep waits under 9 minutes if you can.
   Even less for long rides (5 minutes and more).  If waits get above 15 minutes
   the people will get fed up and leave the line.

   Finally, don't just wrap the queue around itself, try to open up some holes
   to the side to place trees, fountains, etc.  This will help keep the guests
   comfortable, and happy.

       _____ ride entrance              ________    ride entrance
      |     |  |                       |   __   |  |  |
      |  |  |  |                       |  |  |  |  |  |
      |  |  |  |                       |  |  |  |  |  |
      |  |  |  |                       |  |  |  |__|  |
      |  |_____|                       |  |  |________|

    Example of a boring Queue         Example of a better Queue

   Dynamic Queues:
     Alright there's no such thing (see the Wish List in the Final Words section
     below) but there is a good way to "fake it".  A dynamic queue is one that
     changes its size depending on need, i.e. if more people want to ride it, it
     increases in size, if less people want to ride, it decreases in size.  When
     you first build a ride have one section that "pokes out" of your main line
     queue.  This will accommodate the larger crowds that new rides see.  When
     the crowd dies down, or if the wait time is too much, simply cut off that
     area of the queue.

   When to have No Queue At All:
     There are times when you don't even need to build a queue.  Simply having
     the entrance built right next to a path will allow people to enter the
     ride.  This is only feasible with certain types of rides (never ever do it
     with a rollercoaster, for example).  The best rides to do it with are the
     Space Rings, Maze, Car Ride, Boat Hire, and the Slide.  If you build these
     on a crowded enough path, then they will always be full, yet never need a
     queue (therefore people are never actually waiting for the ride, and
     therefore never becoming unhappy with a long wait).

   Note: Even a ride with no queue, still has a queue of one person, except now
         that person is waiting on a normal path.
   Note: Entertainers can help keep the people in line amused.


   Ride Exits:
     The best place to put a ride exit is on an already existing path, rather
     than building a path specifically for the exit.  (That can result in dead
     ends, and lost guests)  Which means that you will want to place the ride
     at least 1 square away from any paths, and then place the exit somewhere
     in that area.
     Note: Placing the exit near the entrance will promote repeat business on
           that particular ride. (especially useful on rollercoasters)
     Note: If your exit is not connected to a path, and is over water, guests
           will all fall off and drown.

   Now Incorporating all of the Queue ideas, we'll now do a little trick, that
   seems to me, to save a little space.  First build a Merry-Go-Round 1 square
   away from a path.  Build the entrance on the far side away from the path, and
   build the exit right next to the path.  Now build the queue so that it goes
   immediately back to the path.  This method has several advantages, the first
   being that the Exit is always on a normal path, so you don't have to create
   new dead-end paths; second, it saves space.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2  Park Maintenance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Mechanics:
     It is my theory that for every 4 rides you build you should hire a new
     Mechanic.  This keeps a "net" of coverage on your park, as there will
     usually be a mechanic nearby if a ride breaks.

     As your rides age, their reliability will go down tremendously.  To help
     alleviate this problem, swap the Inspection rate on the rides down to
     "every 10 minutes".  At each inspection the reliability will go up a
     little.  Also if your rides are REALLY old (5+ years) you need to take
     drastic measures to insure that they don't crash.  Consider replacing the
     ride.  Or, just reduce the number of trains on a rollercoaster down to 1.
     (this will avoid a crash) Another way to tell if it is time to replace a
     ride is "Down Time".

     Note: If you want to get your mechanic somewhere quicker, do NOT just pick
           him up and put him there, this resets his JOB and he will forget
           what he was doing.  Instead just wait.  If you have to wait too long
           you know that you don't have enough mechanics.

     Overkill Maintenance:
       One way to guarantee a good response time from your mechanics is to hire
       one mechanic for every ride (yes, EVERY ride) and give them ONE route
       marker right on the exit of the ride--the route must actually be ON the
       exit, not just by it.  Then set all the ride inspection times to 10
       minutes.  Too bad there's no "Constant Inspection" option.  This comes in
       handy when your roller coasters are very old, and when they fail it can
       be fatal.  With any luck your Mechanic will fix the ride before any
       accidents happen.

       Note:  If the ride exit is at the first square on the station platform,
              the mechanics can reach this end faster and (hopefully) fix the
              station brakes before an accident happen. (Ake Malmgren)

   Handymen:
     For every roller coaster or shop that you build you should hire a new
     Handyman to help with the added trash and vomit.  Make sure to "specialize"
     your handymen, that is, don't have them clean trash AND mow lawns, in that
     that is very inefficient.  Have most your handymen clean trash, water
     gardens, and empty trash cans.  Then have a few mow the lawns.

     15 Second Rule:
       So how many Handymen do you need?  There's no really good way to tell,
       but one strategy I use is to count to 15 once I have spotted some
       garbage.  If by 15 no handyman has ever come onto the screen (max zoom
       in, of course) then I hire a new handyman.  (Then again I subscribe to
       the "More is better than Less" philosophy, I'd rather have more Handymen
       than I need than have less than I need!)  If one has come onto the screen
       in the allotted time, then I move him onto the garbage.  There are,
       naturally, special cases when this rule does not apply:
         1. At the exit of Rollercoasters.  They need a Handyman all their own.
         2. If you already have over 40 handymen, you probably won't want more.
            (although it should be noted, that in large parks, I often end out
            with around 60 handymen)

     Let them Roam:
       So should you give your handymen an area to clean up (assigning an area)
       or should you just let them roam on their own.  Both.  In general you
       want most of your handymen just roaming around, but you also need some to
       permanently stay in your "worst areas" (i.e. those by the pukiest
       rollercoasters).  Why not assign them all routes?  Too much hassle when
       your parks get really large, plus you don't get all that much benefit
       from all your micromanagement.

     Note: Another way to remove litter/puke is to remove the path.


   Entertainers:
     This may not quite be the proper place for this, but this section is
     dealing with Staff, so why not?  Entertainers are just that, entertainers.
     You put them in a costume of your choice, and they wander the park, and
     try to entertain the peeps in your park.  One useful place for them is in
     the Queue.  Some rides either have very long lines or the track is very
     long and needs more time to make it's way around.  Entertainers can be used
     to cheer the waiting guests up.  Below is a list of the Full list of
     costumes available after the release of Loopy Landscapes:

     - Panda Costume
     - Tiger Costume
     - Elephant Costume
     - Roman Costume
     - Gorilla Costume
     - Snowman Costume
     - Knight Costume
     - Astronaut Costume

   Finally, you need security guards to stop Vandalism.  But since you can't
   always stop it, you need to know what to do afterwords.  Vandals strike only
   3 things, benches, garbage cans, and lights.  The vandalized bench will be
   broken in half, the garbage cans will be tipped over, and lamps will have
   their lights broken.  Simply replace the old items with new ones to fix.
   (Don't right click to remove!  That may get rid of the path as well)  So
   who are all these vandals?  If you check the people screen, the vandals are
   the ones with the red snarling faces.  If you manage to catch one of these
   perps, you can try to get his anger out by placing him on a one square path
   with a bench.  He'll smash the bench and become happy again (well... he won't
   be so violent anyway), then you can move him back into the park.  (this is
   covered again in the next section as well)

   Note: Guests doesn't get mad (red-faced) if there is nothing to vandalize.
         (Ake Malmgren)

   Note: Keeping a clean and pleasant park helps cut down on vandalism.  If your
         park is clean enough, you may not need Security Guards at all.  Plus it
         really isn't that hard to replace benches/lamps/trash cans, so lately
         I haven't been hiring Security Guards.

   Note: The maximum number of staff members that you can hire (handymen,
         mechanics, security guards, entertainers) is 116.  However, if you have
         a lot of guests in your park (4000+), you may not even be able to get
         to 116.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3  The Guests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   To better serve your park guests, you will need to understand them.  For one
   thing they are all male, and exactly the same age.  The following is a small
   breakdown of your park guests stats:
      Happiness - happy people stay in your park and will be more willing to
         part with their money.  Happiness is increased by fun rides, like
         roller coasters, and maintained by normal rides.  The guests become
         unhappy if they are: Tired, Sick, Hungry, Thirsty, or have to go to
         the bathroom.  Other things that contribute to unhappiness are:  Long
         waits in line, and inability to find good rides, and how clean/pleasant
         your park is in appearance.  Finally, don't forget that you do have
         Entertainers, and although it seems like they are worthless, they do
         help your guests happiness ratings.
      Energy - a tired guest won't go on anything but the most exciting rides to
         "wake up", but once he has done that will go on other rides.  Tired
         guests also walk slower than others, and are less happy.  Place a
         good roller coaster by the entrance to wake up these sorry fellas.
      Hunger, Thirst - these two stats start at a random value when the guest
         enters the park, usually under 1/4 full.  These values increase mostly
         over time.  Thirst is also affected by what the guest is doing.  Eating
         Fries increases thirst, as does a high nausea rating.
      Nausea, Nausea Tolerance - guests always underestimate their chances of
         getting sick off of a ride.  Nothing you can do about it except provide
         numerous benches, and clean any vomit up.  Also note that sick guests
         become very unhappy and walk very slowly (to the point of slowing down
         the launching of rides).
      Bathroom - need I explain?
   Other Complaints:
      "I'm Lost!" - reduce the number of paths that don't lead to rides, provide
         more Information Kiosks (if you priced the maps high, then reduce that
         price).  Also guests seem to get lost more often when they take a
         transportation ride to a far off section of your park.  Also try to
         build shorter paths between areas of the park.
      "I Can't find XXX Ride" - same as above.  Also Observation Towers can help
         the guest spot the ride.  Or you could take them there directly via
         pincers.  Another thing that may prevent the finding of rides is large
         scenery around the ride, so if there are lots of tall trees, consider
         chopping some.
      "I'm not paying that much for XXXX" - reduce the ride cost, OR change the
         ride around to be more exciting.
      "I can't find the Park Exit", "I want to go home" - you've lost these
         guests, and they want out.  Pick them up with the pincers and get rid
         of them before they become even MORE unhappy.  Nothing you can do will
         keep them in the park, so don't even bother.
         Note: If you need a certain number of guests in your park to pass the
               scenario, you may want to stick these peeps (guests) in a place
               that they can't get out of.  Something like a 1x1 path in the
               middle of nowhere works.  (see "7. Alternative Strategies")

   How Guests Move:
     Guests are morons.  You just have to accept that.  Their normal algorithm
     on moving goes like this:
        Walk down path
        If you are at an intersection, pick a direction at random
     Also realize that Stores, and Line Queues create intersections.  The only
     exception to this algorithm is when a guest knows EXACTLY where he is
     going (his window will say "Heading for XXXX").  This means that you HAVE
     to avoid using Double Paths (paths that are 2+ squares wide), and cutting
     down on intersections also helps.  Employees also follow this algorithm,
     which is really annoying.

   Compliments and How to get them:
     The guests want a nice clean park to visit, good rides to go on, and short
     lines.  Also pricing things affordably gives the guest a good feeling that
     translates into happiness.  When the guest likes something, they will give
     you the "good thought" (check the people button, and look under thoughts).
     Happy patrons, when they leave, promote your park to their friends.

   Big Problems:
     Every once in awhile you will want to check the People button and look at
     a summary of their thoughts (the second "Group" tab).  Checking here will
     give you a good idea of areas to improve in your park.  If a lot of people
     complain of hunger, build some food shops; if people complain of having
     to go to the bathroom, build a bathroom; if lots of people complain about
     waiting in line forever, consider cutting the line down.

   Vandals:
     The best way to prevent Vandalism is to keep your guests happy.  However,
     that doesn't always work, so here's some suggestions on vandalism.
     Whenever a guest goes red in the face, he is about to commit vandalism.  So
     what do you do with a guest that you catch before he does anything?  Put
     him in "Jail".  That is, a one square path with a bench on it for him to
     smash.  Let him smash it and get him outta there.  Consider it "Destructive
     Therapy".  If you are wondering how Security Guards affect vandals, Guests
     do not commit vandalism if there is a guard present.  They don't actually
     get "caught".

     Oddity:  Guests will remain seated on a vandalized bench for quite awhile,
              but no new people can sit on the vandalized bench.

   Note: Guests' Preferred Intensity increases as they ride tame rides (or as
         the manual puts it "Riding less intense rides near a coaster can often
         help guests get up the nerve to ride the more extreme attraction"
         pg. 11)
   Note: Guests who leave happy are considered "Good PR" and a free
         advertisement.
   Note: Guests who Die or Leave unhappy are considered "Bad PR" and can
         discourage others from visiting your park.
   Note: Guests can die in crashes, or drown; see section "4a. Crashes" below
         for more info

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Rides (non Rollercoasters)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Before we get to the Complete Ride Listing, a few words.  All rides have many
   customizations in them.  From the amount of time the ride will take, to the
   amount of people crammed into it, it is usually all contained in the ride
   Information under the Gears tab.  Any ride with independent vehicles, like
   the Chair Lift, or the Boat Hire, has a maximum of 12 vehicles.

   Music rides influence the moods of people walking by, and make them happier.
   Indoor rides are popular when it rains every other ride is considered outdoor
   Custom denotes that you can custom build the ride

   a single * by the people number indicates that many people per vehicle

   a single * in front of the ride name indicates an Add-On only ride

    The Play Music option is found by opening the ride's window and selecting
    the far right tab.  (the "people" tab)

    Tip: (from Ake Malmgren)
      If you have built a ride so near the path that the queue area 'sticks' to
      it before it should, and you won't rebuild the ride or path, you can
      either build the queue area at one level higher or lower than the path, or
      make it so that when you put a queue piece next to the path, it has
      another piece to stick to rather than the path.

               Like this:

                     SSSSSSSSSSSS  <-- Station platform
          Entrance  -->EQ          <-- Build this first
          Queue     -->QX          <-- So that this will not stick to main path
          Main path --> PPPPPPPPP
                              P
          X is where you want to place the queue piece

  Entrance Options (Add-On)

    With Loopy Landscapes, you are now able to change the Entrances to the 
    Rides in your park.  This is actually more of a landscaping option, 
    although the option is available on each ride's panel.  Here is a list of
    the theme options:

      - Plain Style Entrance/Station (what you normally see)
      - Canvas Tent Style Entrance/Station
      - Castle Style Entrance/Station (brown)
      - Castle Style Entrance/Station (grey)
      - Log Cabin Entrance/Station
      - Wooden Style Entrance/Station
      - Jungle Style Entrance/Station
      - Classic/Roman Style Entrance/Station
      - Pagoda Style Entrance Station
      - Abstract Style Entrance/Station
      - Snow/Ice Style Entrance/Station
      - Space Style Entrance/Station

    Note: This affects both the Entrance of the ride, as well as the Stations
          (where applicable).

  Gentle Rides:
    People for the most part don't like Gentle Rides.  Most people want to ride
    Rollercoasters (not all, some are a little chicken).  But you can usually
    get anyone onto a Gentle Ride.  They tend to ride Gentle Rides AFTER having
    already ridden on something exciting.  This is the most true with the
    Haunted House, which can have no business at all if people haven't ridden
    something exciting first.  The other time when a lot of people ride gentle
    rides is when they are getting up the courage to ride something more
    thrilling.

  Custom Rides:
    So what exactly makes a good custom ride?  First off, each custom ride has
    a saved template in the game, so you don't have to start off designing them
    right away.  The main problem with this is that it doesn't always fit into
    your park.  Remember that the amount of vehicles/trains/boats is determined
    by the size of your Station, and if you have multiple stations, then it is
    decided by the size of your smallest station.  Well here's some notes on
    each ride:

      Boat Hire - a station platform is all you need, you can build "Guide
            Rails" if you want to control where they go, but you don't need to.
            If guests get lost/stuck on your boats, then you might want to
            consider putting in a guide rail.  Also build a Guide Rail if you
            want to limit the amount of time the guest spends on the ride.
            Note: The Guide Rails do not need to form a complete circuit.

      Log Flume - keep this one short with 3 or 4 drops.  3 minutes is plenty,
            any more than that and people start to get impatient and unhappy.
            (they become impatient when they become hungry, which increases over
            time) Also try to use the Log Flume as a showcase for your other
            rides, e.g. have it go through the loop of your coaster, or by your
            Go karts ride.

            Add-On Note:  The Log Flume gets a new track piece, the "turntable",
                          which turns the log around, but only if the log is
                          going slow enough.  If the log is going fast, it won't
                          turn.

      Water Slide - keep it simple, one uphill chain pull and then just move
            them around, use the complete circle tracks to keep them from flying
            off the track.  (the idea is similar to the Bobsled Coaster since
            neither are connected to the track)

            Tadhg Pearson sent me this about Water Slides:
              "Water Slides always go faster when there are people in the boats
              and this can result in 'boat pile ups' when empty boats are
              followed by a few full ones.  Increasing the minimum waiting time
              can help solve this." -- you could also uncheck "maximum" wait
              time, and leave it "waiting for full load".

            Also:
              "Waterslides will always crash if you make a steep drop
              underground using uncovered track."

            Ake Malmgren had this to say about Water Slides:
              "Because the dinghies runs on water, unlike the coasters that runs
              on wheels, they have more friction against the track and loose
              speed faster, so water slides are more difficult to design.

              "When a water slide breaks down, all lift hills stops. That will
              cause the boats to pile up in the lift hill(s), and probably run
              into each other and make jams later in the track. Because of that,
              it is no good idea to have more than one lift hill (I use to have
              it, so i know the problems).

              "(The lift hill stops on all water rides on breakdown)"

      Any Transport - you need at least 2 stations for these to go anywhere,
            Monorail doesn't need a complete loop, and the Chairlift
            automatically makes a loop.  Build the stations at least 6 squares
            and more is always better.  (well...not _always_ but you get the
            general idea!)

      Any Tower - go as tall as you can!

            Note: on Whoa Belly if you make it very tall you will need to
                  increase the launch speed to keep up, but go too fast and it
                  will "jump free" of the tower.  Oddly it may not crash,
                  though.  (the one I built cleared the tower by a good 5 feet
                  but then on the way down, went right back onto the tower;
                  however I tried this again later and it caused a crash)

      Go Karts, Car Ride - Up down, around, whatever.

        Note:  For fun one time I built a really short Go Karts that had only
               2 station platform squares and immediately turned around and
               finished the ride.  Then I put the laps up to 10.  It got an
               excitement of "5 High".  Not bad for a puny ride!

        Dan Mullin had this to add about Go Karts:
          "As with roller coasters it appears that Go-Karts really like to have
          intertwined and paralleled tracks at the same or similar levels, i.e.,
          a driver going one way on a section of track can see a driver going
          another way on a different section.  This seems to boost excitement
          quite a bit.

          "As you know, when run in race mode the winner always gets to take a
          victory lap.  Therefore, a nice balance to achieve in the number of
          laps is completion of the victory lap at about the same time the last
          place car actually finishes.  Otherwise, if you simply cut down the
          number of laps you are not speeding things up and you are reducing the
          excitement level."

        Ake Malmgren had this to say about Go Karts:
          "To get extreme excitement ratings on this ride, build it
          around/through/under/over many rides, preferrably at exciting points,
          like through loops. It is easy to do because of the tight turns on
          this track."

      Hedge Maze - there's no good advice here, except to try to make a good
            maze, but not so hard as to be impossible.  Also keep in mind that
            the longer the guest is lost in your maze, the hungrier/thirstier
            he becomes.

            Note: One of the best ways to build a Maze is to build the Ultra
                  Small Hedge maze.  Have only 2 squares of maze, with only one
                  straight path.  Place both the entrance and exit on a path
                  (i.e. no queues), and you have a very quick loading/unloading
                  ride!  They get out and go right back in!  Best of all, the
                  whole ride + stations takes up only 4 squares, and can be
                  placed almost anywhere.

    Now for more detailed information on Transport rides.

      Chair Lift - Building any more than 7 station squares is unnecessary
            since the CL can only have 12 cars.  Also to decrease the time it
            takes to load the ride, place the Entrance near the beginning (where
            it starts to become the ride) of the Station.  (see Common Problems
            for a "picture" of where to place the Entrance/Exit)  Also increase
            the speed of the ride to 9 mph. (under the Gears tab)

      Monorail, Railroad - these rides really slow down going up hills, so one
            idea is to make them into "subways" and only surface them at each
            station.  Part of the idea with these is to show patrons the park,
            however, so that may not be the best idea.  Again make your stations
            as long as possible to have large multiple trains if you want those.

            Note: The monorail doesn't even need 2 stations to operate, simply
                  set it to "Shuttle Mode" and it will go to the end of the
                  track and back.  Shuttle Mode also works when you don't have
                  a complete loop.

            Note: You can build a maximum of 4 stations!

  Note: The excitement ratings in transport rides and water ride are
        dramatically enhanced when they go through the loop of a rollercoaster.

  Some thoughts on Pricing: (if you don't charge admission into the park, these
    prices are too low for you, charge more)
    These rides fall into 3 pricing categories: freebies, cheap, and workhorse.
    Freebies are gentle rides like the Merry-Go-Round and the Ferris Wheel.  You
    make these free to keep people happy, and in the park.  Cheap rides are the
    other Gentle Rides, the Transportation Rides, and the Boat Hire.  Cheap
    rates are .30 to .90 and keep people coming on rides that they would other
    wise avoid.  Workhorse are all of your exciting rides and the other 3 water
    rides.  These rides are consistently popular and you can therefore charge
    more.  Workhorse rates are .90 to 1.30.
    Also be sure to remember that you can charge more for new rides than old
    rides.  This is due to the "Novelty Factor".  You can sometimes get away
    with $5 admissions on new rides.
    Remember that you get most of your money from Admissions and Roller Coasters
    so don't freak out about the costs of these rides.
    Note: The maximum that you can charge any guest on one ride is $20.

  Further Thoughts on Pricing:
    Some people split hairs trying to get as much money from the guests at
    every possible opportunity, by overcharging on new rides, and gradually
    decreasing the rate.  As near as I can see this will merely deplete your
    guests funds quicker and get them to leave sooner and less happy.  I believe
    that having fair prices (i.e. _not_ overcharging) is better in the long run.
    Firstly your guests can stay in your park longer keeping your guest count
    higher.  Secondly they leave happy, which encourages more people to come to
    your park.  And finally they usually leave with little to no money anyway,
    it doesn't matter if you get it all at once, or gradually, you still get
    their money!

  Loopy Landscapes Park Admission Pricing:
    In case you haven't noticed, when Chris Sawyer made Loopy Landscapes, he
    disabled the ability to charge a "gate fee" to enter the park.  There has
    been a lot of speculation on why this was, and we've received hundreds of
    emails about this issue.  It's simply not possible to charge a gate fee in
    the Loopy Landscapes expansion pack.  With the use of a trainer, on the
    other hand, it is possible to tweak this a bit.  You can download trainers
    on just about every one of the major Rollercoaster Tycoon fan sites (links
    can be found towards the end of this guide).

    To put the speculation of why this was disabled, I (Jim Chamberlin) asked
    Chris Sawyer about this in an interview.  Here's what he had to say about
    the matter:

       "I disabled the gate fee option in the new Loopy Landscapes parks so 
       that the design and themeing of the individual rides became more 
       important and crucial to the success of the park.  If an entrance fee
       is charged it doesn't tend to matter too much if the guests don't 
       enjoy all the rides in the park, so there is little incentive for 
       the player to really think about the design of every single ride.  
       Without an entrance fee though, every ride becomes important, and a 
       poorly designed ride is of no benefit to the park's finances.  
       Although initially it seems more difficult to make money this way, 
       it's actually possible to make more money, as you can charge very 
       high prices for your really big rides, especially when they are new."

       -- Interview w/ Chris Sawyer on RCT Station (May 2001)

  Some thoughts on Spacing:
    Some rides--the Log Flume, Monorail, etc.--launch many separate independent
    vehicles.  Obviously you don't want to launch them all in one bunch, as
    that would be bad spacing (think of waiting in a line that either moves fast
    or not at all, and you see what I mean).  To increase your spacing you need
    to edit how the ride launches each vehicle.  The best way to do this is to
    increase the Minimum Wait time.  This keeps each vehicle there longer, and
    increases the space between it and the previous vehicle.  Another good way--
    especially good on Monorails--is to set both the Minimum and the Maximum to
    the same time, so that it stays at each station exactly that amount of time.
    This keeps your transportation network moving.

    Here's a good formula to follow:
      Minimum Wait Time = (Ride Time Length / Vehicles on Ride) - 1

    Bear in mind that this isn't a perfect formula, and depends on your rides
    loading in less time than the minimum time.  Remember that if it takes
    longer than your minimum time for the guests to load onto the ride, that
    your carefully planned Min. Wait time is worthless.

    Note: The highest setting for "minimum" and "maximum" is 250 seconds.
    Note: The Data Logging graph stops at 5 minutes.

  Thoughts on the Pause:
    This is also discussed down in Alternative Strategies.  Normally if you
    want to change the attributes of a ride (like the amount of logs in a log
    flume) you have to close down the ride, causing everyone to leave the line.
    One way to avoid this is to first Pause the game, then close the ride,
    change what you want to change, and then Unpause.  Quick and easy.  Notice
    how the line stayed where it was.  However, everyone who was on the ride is
    now leaving the ride (you can also Fleece the Guests this way).  They
    surprisingly, don't seem to care that much about this.  (although it should
    be noted that they won't be as happy as they would be if they rode the
    entire ride, since happiness is increased gradually.)

   Special Track Pieces: (not all are available on all coasters)
     On Ride Photo -- Takes a photo of your guests, which they can buy for $2
                      (to start) at a profit of $1.80.  You want one of these on
                      EVERY coaster that has it available!
     Brakes/Booster - One slows you down, the other speeds you up.  One of these
                      alone is not enough to get you up/down to speed.
     Helix         -- A Helix is a banked turn that also goes up or down.  Comes
                      in two flavors, LARGE and SMALL.
     Half Loop     -- The first element in the COBRA LOOP, to use you need to
                      first use a straight track with the small angle up.  Then
                      to finish you need to use a corkscrew.
     Corkscrew     -- Standard corkscrew.
     Inversion     -- Like a corkscrew, but not as large.  Only available on the
                      Inverted Rollercoaster.  (technically a Loop and a
                      Corkscrew are considered "Inversions" but that isn't what
                      we mean here)
     "S" Bend      -- Used to move your coaster 1 square either left or right.
     Vertical Loop -- The normal loop.  Also moved your coaster left or right 1
                      square.  To use have one straight piece angled up slightly
                      then build your loop.
     Steep Twist   -- Not really a "special track" in that it isn't in the
                      little menu, but it counts for me.  It is essentially a
                      turn while going down at the maximum angle (not straight
                      down).  To build it, have a steep drop (or climb) then
                      on the next track have it also go steep, and do the small
                      turn.
     Water Splash  -- Only available on the standard wooden rollercoaster. Sends
                      the coaster train over a "water splash".  Adds excitement
                      but also slows the train down.


   When designing your tracks pay more attention to Lateral G's than Vertical,
   as this will increase the Nausea rating of the ride--which you want to keep
   low.  (Lateral G's are created when you take turns while going very fast)
   Some strategies to keep in mind about L. G's are to slow the coaster down
   before taking turns, and try to avoid using the sharp turns.  And especially
   don't combine the two.  The best way to slow a coaster down before a turn is
   to have it go up a hill right before the turn.  Use brakes sparingly.  Test
   your roller coaster, and if the L.G's exceed about 3 or so several times in
   quick succession, you may need to go back to the Drawing Board.  I'm not
   saying to avoid L.G's completely, as they are quite intense and exciting, but
   keep it within reason.  It does not really matter if you have more than one
   "lift hill", as the guests happiness increases based on the ride as a whole,
   and not by where they currently are.  Finally, when you run a coaster
   through a loop, try to keep the speed down, as fast loops increase intensity
   and nausea really quickly.

   To keep things interesting (and expensive) periodically shut down the roller
   coaster and refit it with something new.  On a wooden roller coaster, try to
   add an On Ride Picture, or a "Splash" section; on a Mini Steel, change the
   cars to Spinning, etc.  This helps to keep your ride from getting stale.

   Further Thoughts on Design:
     If you want to create a Roller Coaster (or any custom ride) and save the
     design, one good way to do it is to follow this idea:
      - Start the Forest Frontier scenario (or any other)
      - Take out the maximum loan
      - Set Research to Maximum, AND take off all research options except
        "Rollercoaster"
           (or if you are doing another ride, check the appropriate option)
      - Design your roller coaster (don't open the park)
      - Test the Design out, try for High Excitement
      - Save the design  (open the ride window, click the Disk button, select
                          save design; Note: you must have named the ride!)
     The idea here is to use this scenario as nothing more than a canvas for
     creating new rides.  Then you can take your saved design and place it into
     whichever scenario you are working on.  This should save you time, and
     money.  An alternate idea is to use a scenario that you have already
     passed that has a lot of money.  Close the park (takes awhile to get those
     guests out of the park, however) and bulldoze the rides.  Save the blank
     park as something else (Test Park works) and start experimenting.  Remember
     that practice makes perfect.
     Note: Intensity of over 10 is unrideable.  Not completely unreadable, mind
           you.  I built an 11 intensity coaster that had an excitement around
           5, but then I cut the intensity back to 9 and the excitement shot up
           to 8.

   What the *&#$% is Intensity Anyway?
     Excitement - is a measure on how exciting the ride looks to a guest and is
        based on Intensity--between 6 and 9 is usually good, anything higher
        and the excitement plummets--and the Aesthetics of the ride itself.
        Large rides with loops generally look more exciting than something that
        is small and flat.  Also try to weave the ride through previous sections
        of the ride--like sending the track through the hole of an earlier loop.
        (it's even better to send _other_ rides through the loop!)  Tunnels and
        Scenery will also help.  Another trick to use is the old "Decapitation
        Trick"; which basically works by dropping just below some obstacle just
        in the nick of time, giving the appearance that it would take your head
        off.  You can also increase excitement in tunnels by placing an object,
        such as a statue, on top of the tunnel.  Finally excitement lowers over
        time but one way to get it back up is to change the ride--like changing
        the type of train on the coaster, painting it, or adding to it.
        Note: Scenery only effects the coaster excitement up to 4 squares away,
              anything further has no effect.
     Intensity - is a measure on how intense the ride is.  So what does that
        mean?  You want to keep the ride moving fast--have only one lift hill--
        and add elements like loops and corkscrews to increase intensity.
        Simply having a tight turn is not in itself a bad thing, it only becomes
        bad if its too fast, and followed by a turn in the opposite direction.
        (think of shaking a soda can, if you simply move it fast in one
        direction it doesn't fizz so much, but if you move it back and forth
        quickly, it fizzes quite a bit)  Have the coaster go up and down, take
        sudden drops, and above all keep the speed up!
     Nausea - is based on the Intensity partly, and on the how you get the
        intensity.  Fast speeds on hairpin turns that go left then right, is
        generally a good way to get people sick.  Try to keep nausea below 7.

   Some Thoughts on Platforms: --from R.D. Mack
     Flush loading (enter on the left, exit on the right or vice versa) can be
     done well if the ride is planned in advance.  In addition, placement of the
     exit and entrance can speed up loading of the coasters, especially if the
     ride is short and runs more than 2 trains. (See below)

     12 length platform, three train operation, 7 cars per train (wooden coaster
     operation)

            E
          XXXXXXXXXXXX
            X

         E - Entrance
         X - Exit

     The exit can be anywhere along the platform as they are in no hurry to
     leave, but now the entrance will be centered on the loading train so that
     the peeps no longer have to walk down to the back. (the peeps walk the same
     distance to the front as to the back, and take less time doing so.)

     This formula can be used for all different types of rollercoasters, as well
     as some of the transport rides. Of course, if one is using a shorter train,
     the platform entrance should be moved towards the center of the train.

   Thoughts on Pricing:
     Roller Coasters are the big money makers, and are very consistent.  When
     it is new, charge $3 to $5 (depending on size and excitement), and as time
     goes on, drop it to the $2 to $3 range.  You shouldn't have to drop it
     further, unless you want to.  On Ride pictures help to increase profits.
     Note: Guests will only buy ONE On Ride picture in your entire park, period.

   Further Thoughts on Nausea:
     Some people just shouldn't ride roller coasters, but do it anyway.  For
     them you need at least 3 benches right outside of the Exit, as well as a
     Bathroom right by the exit.  It is also wise to have a Handyman on patrol
     by the Exits to popular (and therefore pukey) roller coasters.  Also
     sometimes a Drinks stall nearby helps.

   Rain Delays:
     Guests don't like to go on roller coasters (or any other outdoor ride for
     that matter) in the rain.  Doesn't mean that they won't do it, however.
     There are 2 notable times when guests get over their aversion to outdoor
     rides in the rain:
       1. If the ride is new, people will still line up for it (Novelty Factor)
       2. If they just got off the ride and want to go on it again (repeat
          business)
     Anyone else who lines up in the rain is a freak.
     Note: Underground (and mostly underground) rides are considered "indoor".

   Rain Delays 2 -- Beating the Rain:
     So your guests won't go on coasters in the rain... or will they.  We have
     already established that they will go on coasters that are brand new due
     to the Novelty Factor.  So when it is raining, (and if it tends to rain a
     lot in that scenario) you might want to try "Breaking up the Ride".  That
     is, remove one section of the ride (after it was closed, of course), and
     then re-open the ride.  Since the ride is now considered "new", you should
     be able to get peeps to line up for it.  Best done during prolonged rain
     storms that cut your lines down to zero.

   How to Build an Underground Roller Coaster:
     If you've played the Katie's World scenario, you know that it is possible
     to have a coaster completely underground.  Well how do you do that?  It is
     actually kind of simple.  Cut away some land down to the level that you
     want to build your coaster.  Then build one station platform above ground
     in the hole, with the next station platform going underground.  Then remove
     the first station platform and raise the land back to where it was.  You
     are now free to build that underground coaster!  You should realize, of
     course, that this is much more expensive than building a normal coaster.
     Note: The maximum height for land is 31, so the highest drop that you could
           manage underground is a 29.

   How to build an Elevated Roller Coaster:
     Ever want to put that coaster station above ground in the air?  Well it
     isn't so hard to accomplish.  Simply raise one square of terrain to the
     level that you want, and build your first station on that, then just keep
     building.  Then later go back and lower that piece of terrain back to the
     ground level.

   Transport Rollercoasters:
     You may eventually want to use a Rollercoaster as a train to shuttle people
     from one area to another.  Bear in mind that you can't use the powered
     launch mode with 2 stations, therefore you have to build a lot of "Booster"
     tracks to keep it going.  Also if you make a straight track it will be
     very boring.  You will want to add some excitement to it via a Loop or
     something similar.
     Note: You don't actually have to have the guests go through the loop, as
           long as it exists on the track somewhere, it will increase the
           excitement.

   Fix the Crazy Vole:  (Wild Rodent)
     This ride actually needs a bit of a tune up to make it better.  Sometimes
     when the cars launch from the station, they don't have enough speed to make
     it all the way to the lift hill, which is surprisingly far away.  To help,
     have a small downhill section out of the station, then turn it and then
     back up and onto the lift hill.

   The Single Dueling Coaster:
     This isn't so hard to produce.  Simply build one coaster as normal, except
     that when you get to finish the ride, move the track 1 square left or right
     and make a new station that would be identical in length to the first one.
     Now build a second coaster.  Try to keep it the same size as the first
     section.  To finish the ride off, have the track go back into the first
     station.  Now you'll probably want to get half the Trains to each station,
     so push the "Test Ride" button until half the trains have left, then click
     the Red "Close Ride" button once.  To get the 2 stations to synchronize,
     click the "Synchronize with Adjacent Station" buttons (you have to do this
     for each station!)  Now you just need to place 2 entrances,  2 exits, and
     you're done!

     Note:  Do not simply link 2 separate coasters together to make one, that
            doesn't work!
     -- answer from alt.games.rctycoon, Michael Kerr

   Painting Each Section (Add-On):
     So you want to paint your coaster in a hundred different colors, each
     section being different from the last.  Now you can.  Go into the paint
     tab like always, and note the "Track" and under that "Main Color Scheme".
     Click on Main Color Scheme to bring up a menu that also includes 3
     alternate color palettes.  Select one of the alternates, then change some
     of the colors in the normal fashion.  Now click the Brush button and click
     on any section of track to color it.  Now if you change the colors in the
     menu all the sections you painted with it will change colors as well.

   Add-On Testing Note:  Guests seem to wait for rollercoasters to be tested
                         once you get the Add-On.  Which means, no more getting
                         them on any old ride, now you have to make sure it is
                         rideable before they will ride it.  This means that if
                         you created the Coaster of Death (you know that it's
                         intensity will be way too high), and you want to get
                         peeps on it before you test.  Nope!  Peeps now need
                         documented evidence that this ride won't cause their
                         hearts to burst!


   If you want a more in depth look on Rollercoaster Construction go down to
   "4b. Building Good Coasters"
   Some more ride design ideas can be found in "7. Alternative Ideas"

   Note: If you demolish a ride that had an On Ride Photo, all the photos from
         that ride disappear as well!
   Note: The cheapest roller coaster (pre-made) is the Shuttle Launch Steel
         Roller Coaster.
   Note: Spinning cars on the Mini Steel Rollercoaster increases Nausea more
         than they increase Excitement.
   Note: Naming your Coasters different names, not only helps you differentiate
         between them, but can also help your guests out!

4.1  Crashes!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   If you are lucky, you won't ever have to deal with a crash.  However, it is
   very likely that you will have to eventually.
   Preventing:
     Constant Maintenance!  On your old rides, decrease the inspection time down
     to 10 minutes (this may require more Mechanics).  This increases your
     reliability rating on the ride, and may help avert major disaster.
     The most common crash is that of Station Brakes Failure on a Roller
     Coaster.  To prevent this common malady you need to slow the friggin
     coaster before it gets to the track.  There are several ways to do this:
        - Have a lift hill right before you go back into the station, this is
          a separate system from the brakes and won't fail in the same explosive
          way.  (having other brakes, i.e. track brakes, does not work because
          all brakes tend to fail at the same time)
        - Use up all the speed in the ride.  This entails a lot of good ride
          design as you have to get its speed down before it enters the station
          yet still avoid stalled out trains, and trains going backwards.
     Coasters that come into the station at 5 MPH tend to not crash as much as
     coasters coming in at 90 MPH.  Other ideas to try are to have a Mechanic on
     permanent patrol near your rides, or you could finally remove all the other
     trains completely.  (if you do that make sure that the train has the
     maximum amount of cars allowed)
       Dan Mullin has this to add:
       "I tend to design a coaster so that as much speed is dumped
       during the ride as possible, then the train is actually hauled back into
       the station by a small lift hill (maybe 2-3 levels).  This can be
       accomplished by either raising the station a few ticks above the ground
       or, even better, having the end of the coaster ride underground, then
       hauling back up to ground level.  The latter will normally increase your
       excitement level.  Either way, a train that has to pull back uphill to
       enter the station at 5 MPH WILL NOT CRASH."

     The other main way to crash a ride is through bad design.  So avoid bad
     designs! (easier said than done, eh?)  Typical bad designs are when you
     build a hill that is higher than your train can get up.  It will then slide
     back down and hit the next train coming down the track.  The easiest way
     to fix that is to change the hill to a lift hill.  Also on your test
     modes, have only one train go through the ride at a time to avoid any on
     ride collisions.  (an alternative to switching to one train, is to watch
     to see if it will crash, then to quickly hit the Close button, which will
     somehow magically remove the trains)

     Note: If you crash something in the "Test" mode, guests will still fear the
           ride ("I'm not going on that, it isn't safe!").

     Note: When two vehicles are racing to each other, the faster moving one is
           the "lucky" one to explode.  (Ake Malmgren)

   Recovering from a crash:
     The best way to recover, is to scrap the ride and build a new ride there.
     This is because crashed rides have horrid reputations and people will avoid
     it like the plague.  However, it isn't always feasible to replace rides
     (cost, or maybe you really like the ride), so there is a plan to save it
     and get it back to being popular.  Close the ride for 2-4 months.  Give it
     only 1 train.  Repaint the entire ride to a different color scheme (I don't
     know if this helps them forget that people died here, but it couldn't
     hurt), and if necessary, advertise the ride.  After your Mechanic has had a
     look at the ride, double click the Close button on the roller coaster to
     reset the ride, and then you can re-open it.  Your roller coaster should be
     a big hit again!  Also be SURE to give it a 10 minute inspection time.  And
     if you feel like it, you can edit the ride a little.  (add that On Ride
     Photo you always wanted!)  Don't worry if it isn't popular right away, it
     will take some time to get there.

   Note: One odd way to crash is to have the coaster fly through the ground.
         If you have an incomplete track that allows the coaster train to fly
         off the track, and it goes into the side of a cliff, instead of going
         "BOOM" it will go through the cliff, and will only crash when it
         reaches the edge of your park.  (either the sides, or the low level)

   Note: Besides dying in crashes, guests can also drown.  Guests will drown if
         your ride exit is over water, and has no path connecting to it (then
         they'll fall right in), if you destroy a path that is over water they
         will fall in, or if you use the pincers to put them in directly.

   Note: If two cars is swinging towards each other on adjacent tracks, they may
         collide and lose almost all speed.  This happened to me with the
         suspended aeroplane cars, I don't know if it happens with the normal
         cars, or with the suspended suspended sigle-rail RC. (Ake Malmgren)

   Note: The "Holding Brake" on the Vertical RC will not fail with the rest of
         the brakes at a Station Brake failure.  (Ake Malmgren)

   An In-Depth Look at Crashes (from Metro Master):

     Before getting into major detail, it has become increasingly clear that 
     game author Chris Sawyer invested a great amount of effort on realistic 
     details.  There appears to be very little that escaped him.  With that 
     in mind, it should come as no surprise that the more complex the ride, 
     the greater the possibility for failure, breakdown, disaster.  Hedge 
     mazes and rowing boats do not breakdown.  Bumper cars and Ferris wheels 
     breakdown.  Roller coasters breakdown and crash.  I will be primarily 
     concerned with roller coaster crashes here, even though from time to 
     time I will make mention of other attractions if they are relevant to 
     the subject matter at hand.  Having said that, settle in and prepare 
     yourself for long reading.

     I observed all types of coasters running for about 10 game years under 
     a number of varying conditions, which I will address in the same order 
     as follows:

     (1) With regard to braking sections and the station brakes failure.
     (2) Regarding inspections, their schedules, and the assignment of 
         mechanics.
     (3) Other causes of crashes.
     (4) The ride operations box (the one with the gears).

     Firstly, I have never had a crash with only one train on a closed loop 
     of track. There is just nothing else there for the train to run into, 
     unless you have designed the coaster so badly that it simply sails off 
     the track into open space. I do not say this derogatorily. Bobsleds, 
     side frictions and water slides can get airborne a lot easier than you 
     may think.  Reverse whoa belly coasters and shuttle loop types can also 
     be run off the end of the track to their demise, but then again, that's 
     poor planning and bad design.  Not the type of crashes under discussion 
     here.

     (1) Braking sections and the station brakes failure

     If you are in the habit of zooming to the scene after a crash, and 
     checking with the ride operations box, you will know by now that all 
     too often it identifies the cause as "Station Brakes Failure" which 
     is, by far, the most frequent cause of crashes.  According to what 
     Steve shared with me from the Official RCT/CF strategy guide, when 
     this happens after the coaster has been in service for a number of 
     years the cause is likely to be that the brakes have worn out, and 
     replacing them (the brake sections) may very well be a viable 
     alternative to tearing down the entire ride.  This sounds better than 
     it works.  The game does not acknowledge new parts of the ride.  And
     in tests I have discovered that the same breakdown will occur again 
     within a year, while the reliability and down time do not change 
     significantly as a result of such replacement.  I have long maintained 
     that adding additional braking sections prior to entering the station
     decreases the number of "station brake failure" crashes. I have
     subsequently observed that these two appear to operate in direct 
     proportion to each other.  In other words, If you want less "station 
     brakes failures", add more braking sections.  My observations with 
     Steve's "Thunderbolt" and "Cyclone" bore this out very significantly. 
     Both of these are very good renditions of their real life counterparts 
     at Coney Island, N.Y. Steve used short trains on them.  Short trains 
     have less momentum and therefore require less braking.  Along with this, 
     there are long straight sections all with additional brakes adjusted to 
     smoothly reduce train speed, just prior to the station entrance.  The 
     energy of the train is dissipated over a longer period, resulting in 
     much less wear and tear on all the brakes.  As such, crashes on these
     coasters are rare indeed.  However, when I removed all the extra brake 
     sections and conducted the very same tests, crashes began to occur as 
     early as the third year in service.  So additional braking sections are 
     indeed a very effective way to reduce the number of crashes on your 
     coaster.  Although there are those who insist that all brakes fail when 
     the "station brakes failure" occurs, I can assure you that this is not 
     so.  On several occasions during these observations I have seen the 
     "station brakes failure" pop up in the operations window, and the next 
     train into the station would slow down to a crawl on the braking section 
     I had added prior to the station entrance, and then coast slowly right 
     through the station and back to the lift hill.  This indicated that 
     only the brakes in the station had failed and not the additional ones. 
     However, I also had times when it appeared that all of the brakes did 
     fail simultaneously and the train would crash into its leader after 
     blazing through the station with undiminished speed.

     The big steel coasters are indeed most likely to crash, simply because 
     they are even more complex, intense, heavy and generally run faster 
     than their wooden counterparts.  This too, has been confirmed in my 
     observations.  I tested Cav's "Reflections", "Double Take" and 
     "Psycho Line". These are very complex steel racing coasters, of which 
     "Psycho Line" is of the vertical drop type and the other two are 
     corkscrew.  They all have a sweeping curve as the grand finale before 
     entering the station. Hence no additional brakes near the station, and 
     the station brakes themselves must dissipate all that energy on an 
     already longer, heavier and faster moving steel coaster train.  However, 
     "Reflections" and "Double Take" are racing coasters on one continuous 
     loop of track with two adjoining stations operating only two eight car 
     trains, which are synchronized.  So the trains were always equi-distant
     from each other and as such they never crashed.  Nonetheless the dreaded 
     "station brakes failure" did rear its ugly head about as often as could 
     be expected.  I did some major surgery on both of them and added brake 
     sections prior to the station and in the ensuing tests the "station 
     brakes failures" were reduced by about 30%.  I had similar results with 
     Cav's "Psycho line".  There are six three car trains on this coaster 
     also running as a racing coaster looped on itself and synchronized.  
     But the track is so long that it is possible to avoid the crash entirely 
     by setting the proper holding time in the station with the ride 
     operations box (more on this later).  If you have the luxury of a 
     coaster with a very long track, the time needed for the trains to 
     traverse the loop works in your favor and it's almost as if there were 
     only one train present on the track.  These coasters are true works of 
     art.  No serious RCTycooner should be without them.  I had also 
     conducted similar testing on "The Storm" which is a large mine train 
     coaster in "Katie's World".  Without modification this coaster crashed 
     within three years.  When I modified the station approach with additional
     brake sections, it gave me eight crash free years, while another steel 
     coaster I had built elsewhere in the park (without) additional braking 
     sections suffered a crash about every three to four years.

     There are some types of coasters on which adding braking sections is not 
     possible and most of them operate in single car consists.  These include 
     wooden crazy rodent, single rail, suspended single, heartline twister, 
     and Virginia reel.  It appears to me that when such single car trains 
     are operated, the program gives us a break, in that even with "station
     brakes failure" evident, the cars simply bump into each other and stop
     without a crash and loss of life.  But the fact is that crashes only
     occur at speeds over 30 MPH, with the big coasters.  With these smaller
     coaster cars, the crash only occurs if the cars are outside of the
     station limits and moving at over 30 MPH. Even the water rides will
     crash if you can get the boat to collide at speed outside of the station 
     limits.  I've noted that multi car bobsled trains, however, will crash 
     and kill, even though they do not have the option for additional brakes. 
     But then again this is because the Bobsleds move at a much higher speed 
     that these other coasters.  The option to install additional brakes on 
     rides operating such single cars is not needed, as these cars frequently
     do not have sufficient momentum to complete the track circuit, and will 
     come to a complete stop unless the track has been carefully planned and 
     laid out.  Which brings me to another important point.  Although these 
     single car units do not generally crash because of "station brakes 
     failure", they will crash and kill if they should lose momentum on a 
     grade and roll back into the following car, (more on this type of crash 
     later) or if they should fly off the track in a curve.

     (2) Scheduling inspections and assigning mechanics

     Assign a mechanic to each coaster, confining his patrol to the immediate 
     area around the ride's exit.  A good coaster will show enough profit to 
     cover the expense of its own mechanic.  Schedule inspection for every 10 
     minutes.  Assigning the mechanic in this way can actually save the 
     situation directly because of his proximity to the ride.  Since my last 
     report, I have had the situation in which a mechanic so assigned was able 
     to access and repair the brakes just seconds before the train came  
     racing in.  There is no doubt in my mind that had he not been confined 
     to the immediate area of the exit, there would have been a crash in the 
     station, due to his longer response time.  The other benefit to this, is 
     that inspections will take place in a very timely fashion, and the ride 
     will be maintained to its best possible standard.  Also, "down time", 
     best described as the time the ride is out of service (the interval 
     between the breakdown and the repair) will be considerably reduced.  
     Steve, also shared with me from the RCT/CF strategy guide, that it is 
     sound planning to assign one mechanic for every two gentle and/or 
     thrill rides, particularly as they begin to age (over three years old). 
     I concur with this.  Beyond that age, all rides can begin to experience 
     frequent breakdowns, and not having enough mechanics, or their having 
     to travel too far and service too many rides can keep rides out of 
     service for excessive periods of time.  Non working rides make no money 
     and only serve to frustrate the guests who would otherwise enjoy riding 
     them.

     (3) Other causes of crashes

     There are a number of factors, other than "station brakes failure" which 
     can cause your prized coaster to crash, kill off a trainload of folks 
     and a substantial part of your income.  One of these, is where a train 
     that has otherwise been operating normally suddenly fails to crest a 
     hill, rolls back into its follower and KABOOM!!  Steve had this
     experience and suggested wheel failure as the cause, and proposed 
     additional lift chains near the tops of likely trouble spots as the 
     solution.  I didn't really give this much thought until a train I was 
     operating had a wheel problem.  Steve's suggestion came to mind and my 
     railcar inspector's explanation confirmed what he (Steve) had said.  
     This was my first indication as to just how much detail Sawyer had 
     programmed into the game.  Steve also recently shared with me, from 
     the strategy guide, that his remedy of adding short lift chains to 
     some hills is, in fact, a bona fide procedure used on some older 
     coasters.  The Coney Island Cyclone, for one, has had such "surgery".  
     I recently documented such a crash with fatalities on a wooden crazy 
     rodent coaster, as well.  So when your aging coaster rolls back off 
     the second or third hill and crashes, the problem is wheel failure 
     and the remedy is to add lift chains to the hill or boosters just 
     before as the case may warrant.

     Another, I honestly believe, is the slipstream effect.  Sometime ago 
     Cav designed a really nice coaster.  It operated (if memory serves) 
     five three car trains.  The trains came off the lift hill, executed 
     two loops and then curved around and ran through the two loops.  It was 
     very impressive to watch one train passing through the loop while its 
     follower was executing the loop right around it.  The problem was that 
     if the trains passed directly over (under) each other, the leading one 
     would experience a sudden and dramatic loss of speed, and subsequently 
     stall out further down the track, with the result that the train that 
     had so eloquently looped around it would now smash into it.  According 
     to Cav, he ran this test countless times always with the same result, 
     whenever the trains passed exactly over (under) each other.  I had
     him e-mail me the coaster and I also achieved the exact same results 
     in numerous test runs.  I have to conclude that the program identifies 
     with, and responds to the slipstream effect (called "wake turbulence" 
     by air traffic controllers), which is created when an object is moving 
     at speed, but the heavier and the faster it moves, then the more 
     turbulence is created.  The vortex from the looping train is literally 
     pulling the speed off the other one.  Maybe this explains the new larger 
     loop in the Corkscrew Follies add-on!

     On a rare occasion, you may have a crash and then find that the last 
     breakdown was "safety cut-out".  Indeed, it is rare.  But I did happen 
     to witness how it occurs during the testing.  If the "safety cut-out" 
     occurs immediately after the last car of a train clears the station, 
     that train will stop.  The train behind it will coast into the 
     "waiting for passengers to get in" position.  Even if you have various 
     wait options selected in the Ride Operations Box (more on this later), 
     the time will probably elapse while the ride is under repair.  There 
     should be no danger from an incoming train at this point as the problem 
     is not "station brakes failure" and the next arrival should therefore 
     make a normal stop.  The problem is that as soon as repairs are effected 
     the lead train will move and the second one will move right out behind 
     it. (Does this program also simulate dispatching test trains after a 
     failure?)  Now you have two trains right behind each other with less than
     a car length between them.  The space will be slightly relieved as train
     1 will leave the lift hill first and gain a little headway on its 
     follower.  But when train 1 hits the station platform and suddenly 
     decelerates to "arriving at station" speed with train 2 right behind it 
     at "regular over the road speed", guess what?  I suspect that if there 
     were a long gradual braking prior to the station then train 2 might 
     just engage brakes before striking the rear of its leader.  However, I 
     have been unable to confirm this, "safety cut-out" happens often enough, 
     it just doesn't happen all that often right after a train clears the 
     station platform.

     (4) The Ride Operations Box (or scheduling your departures)

     I chose to address the ride operations box last because I believe that 
     its effect on crashes may not be as significant as I first thought. 
     Although considering the attention given to detail in this game I would 
     not discount it entirely.  To me this box serves the same purpose as a 
     Train Dispatcher does in real life.  This box is simply the means by 
     which you issue instructions to the staff that operate the ride.  If 
     you first think of what exactly it is you want to tell your ride operator 
     to do, this box becomes simple.  But here I will deal with how it relates 
     to crashes.

     Coasters with only one train are never a problem.  So with them, 
     concern yourself only with how many people you board without making 
     others wait excessively.  Set the "wait for" and "maximum waiting time" 
     accordingly, and you should have no problem.  At the other end of the 
     spectrum is the steel coaster which is operating say seven two car 
     trains.  Just by the nature of steel coasters we already know that this 
     could very well be a recipe for disaster.  But it can still be operated 
     in relative safety.  For this type of coaster forget everything but 
     the "minimum waiting time."  There are a large number of fast moving 
     trains on the line.  This, in and of itself, should generate a good 
     crowd waiting to ride.  So in testing, rotate the screen so that you can 
     keep a constant watch on the signal light at the end of the station. 
     This signal is directly controlled by the "minimum waiting time". 
     Adjust the number of seconds so that any given train is leaving the 
     lift hill chain just before the following train is engaging it at the 
     bottom.  This will expedite your trains through the station as quickly 
     as realistically possible thus minimizing their chances of being there 
     should something go wrong.  On Cav's "Psycho Line" mentioned earlier, I 
     set the "minimum waiting time" at 20 seconds, and turned off everything 
     else except "synchronize with adjacent stations".  The distance between 
     trains on such a long track afforded the mechanic stationed at each 
     exit the time to access the station and effect repairs before the train 
     could complete the circuit and crash.  With other numbers of trains/cars, 
     you should experiment and go with what works best for you.  But do not 
     ever use the "leave if another train arrives at station" and think that  
     you will avoid a crash.  I use the "wait for" and "maximum waiting time" 
     for one train coasters and the "minimum waiting time" for all others.  
     If you have a great coaster you won't have to "wait for" any load.  The 
     load will be waiting when the trains pulls in.

4.2  Basic Coaster Building
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the best coaster designer in the
   world.  But I have been doing it for quite awhile, and know a few tips and
   tricks to help you build a good coaster.  Also if you have any ideas of your
   own, I would love to hear them!  (manymoose@hotmail.com)

   Firstly: - - t h e  S t a t i o n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
     Make sure to give yourself plenty of room in all directions for your
     coaster.  Have at least 3 squares from your station to the path where you
     will connect the entrance to.  And on almost every rollercoaster you
     design, you want to build as many stations as you can (don't stop until it
     says you can't build any more station platforms!).  The exception to this
     is the Wild Mouse, which doesn't require such a long station.

   Note: Speed alone does not create excitement nor intensity, rather it is
         acceleration (called "G" forces) that your ride produces.  Acceleration
         (if you don't know) is created by a change in velocity, either speed
         up/down, or change directions.  A turn to the left/right is called a
         lateral acceleration (lateral G forces), while a change going up/down
         is called a vertical acceleration (vertical G forces).

   Second: - - t h e  L i f t  H i l l - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
     Now we need to build a lift hill (or if you'd rather not, see below
     "7. Alternative Strategies").  Based on the size that you want the ride to
     be is how tall you want your lift hill to be.  Really large rides require
     a large (25+ units tall) hill, while smaller ones can make do with a
     small lift hill.  Also try to keep in mind the distance from your track to
     the ground, not only does it get more expensive to build up at great
     heights, but you are limited to how high you can get off the ground.  If
     you ever need it to go higher than you are allowed, simply raise the ground
     under the track.  If your coaster is going to be using a long train (mine
     train, corkscrew, etc.) you are going to want to have 2-3 flat tracks at
     the top of your lift hill, before sending the track down its first hill.
     Why?  Because without it a lot of the train will still be climbing the hill
     when the first part starts to go down, slowing the first drop somewhat.

   Third: - - H i l l s  &  L o o p s - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
     Remember that you can't go as high up the next hill as you went down
     the first.  (conservation of energy)  This means that if you went down
     15 units on the first hill, you can only go up 12 or so on the next.  The
     same thing holds true for loops and other trick tracks.  You can only make
     it through the loop if you have enough speed before it, which means that
     the loop has to be lower than the last drop it came from.  (unless you've
     already built up a lot of speed)  The way around this are BOOSTER tracks
     and BRAKES.  If your test ride didn't make it through a loop, then replace
     a track or two before it with some boosters, and set the speed high.
     Likewise if the ride is too intense, you could add brakes before the loop
     to slow it down.  Some fun alternatives to Loops (but which still go
     upside-down) are as follows:
      - Put down one corkscrew, then do another of the same direction so that
        it is like a U-Turn
      - Put down a Half-Loop then a Corkscrew for an odd way to turn a direction
        or if you want you can reverse it and do a corkscrew then the Half Loop.

   Fourth: - - E x c i t e m e n t  &  I n t e n s i t y - - - - - - - - - - -
     You have to have both Intensity (a measure of what your ride does)
     and Excitement (a measure of how your ride does it).  Also keep in mind
     that you don't want too high of intensities (10+) as that DECREASES
     Excitement, and if you get higher than that NO ONE WILL RIDE AT ALL.  You
     can increase Intensity by adding Loops and other special tracks, or by
     taking high speed turns.  You increase Excitement by what you do with the
     ride.  If you send it through a tunnel, you increase Excitement.  If you
     send it around another ride, or by some large scenery, or have it race
     another coaster, you increase Excitement.  One of my favorite things to do
     is to Loop through another Loop.

   Fifth: - - R i d e  L e n g t h - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
     One of the biggest problems I have run into is how LONG to make a roller-
     coaster.  Quite often I end out making too short of a ride.  Remember that
     you CAN have more than one lift hill if you need it, so if you can build
     the ride longer than you think it can handle.  Then if you need to you add
     the lift hill at the end, and that may help prevent crashes (see "4a.
     Crashes!" for more info).

   Tip: Another odd way to change the direction with corkscrews and half loops
        is to build a half corkscrew, half loop down, half loop up again, and
        then another half corkscrew. Then you can make the train go the opposite
        direction next to the incoming track, or the same direction shifted one
        square left or right(same effect as the s-bend). (Ake Malmgren)

   Tip: If you've built a what you think is a great rc, but the guests still
        think it's lame, try to increase the speed by making the first lift hill
        higher. I shifted the lift hill end on a huge wooden rc one level up,
        and the excitement rating was more than doubled! (Ake Malmgren)

 Dueling Rollercoaster Strategy by Twitch:

      KEY
      :     = To/Then
      " "   = Repeat
      >     = Next
      i.e.  = That is

    The Basics: First of all, rollercoasters cost a lot of money and as you
    should know two cost more.  Duh!  So if you don't got the cash (Ranging from
    $30,000-$100,000, depending on the type of coaster) you've got better things
    to do. Like meeting your objectives.  A carbon copy of the same
    rollercoaster isn't really going to boost your excitement, i.e., if you
    decide to build a duplicate of a ride next to the original it isn't going to
    help for jack.  No interaction = No extra excitement.  But you knew that
    already, didn't you?  A dueling rollercoaster is called a dueling
    rollercoaster for a reason.  It crosses paths repetitively from start to
    finish and should look alike.  Not because it has two stations.  So if you
    think you've made a dueling rollercoaster here's how to tell if it is.  If
    the stations are touching each other, not a square away or more from each
    other, then you've got the first step right.  If the first half of the ride,
    or most of the first half, are identical and have lots of interaction, i.e.,
    it has twists and stuff intertwining each other, then you've got step two
    right.  Finally if each train gets to the station within 20 seconds of each
    other then you've got step three rite. If it's more than 20 seconds it just
    doesn't seem like a race anymore.

    The Real Coaster:  Here you will find how to make an ideal dueling
    rollercoaster.  Follow these steps, master them and you'll be making these
    bad boys in no time. After doing this for a while it almost gets mechanical,
    an instinct if you will.  My last dueling coaster had an 8.83 excitement
    and just over 9 in intensity and it only took me 5-10 minutes to make, with
    outside interruptions!  For wooden rollercoasters making them into
    dueling rollercoasters isn't hard at all. The basic steps you should take
    are as follows:

      Lift to top of drop: Drop: Rise (just more than half of the drop): Banked
      helix down (in different directions until they reach each other, i.e., one
      goes left and the other goes right): Drop#2:  banked helix [in same
      direction this time but make the outside track longer than inside track,
      (the outside track is the one opposite to the direction of the turn, i.e.,
      if the turn is to the left than the track on the right side is the outside
      track and vise versa) as to make it possible for the two tracks go the
      same direction]:  Now something to even the tracks to the same speed (an
      extra little hill and drop to the inside track usually does the trick or
      lacking that a small brake): " " step 3,4,5,6 (if you want): Freestyle
      (anything you want to do, helixes, drops, just make sure that each track
      separates from each other): Rejoin (have the two tracks intertwined again,
      as to add more excitement, " " steps 3,4,5,6 (if you want): Freestyle:
      " " Rejoin step: " " Rejoin and Freestyle as many times as you want:
      Return to station (AT A MODERATE  SPEED)

    These steps also apply to any other track with the banking helix ability.
    One thing to remember is that if the type of coaster you're making doesn't
    have the banking helix ability it's probably not worth making into a dueling
    rollercoaster as banking helixes are the heart of the dueling rollercoaster.

    When it comes to steel coasters the same steps apply to the track design as
    wooden tracks.  The only extra would be the vertical loops or half loops.
    These can simply be added between either the Drop: Rise step, Banked helix
    down: Drop or Freestyle: Rejoin steps.  It's actually less complicated than
    it sounds.  Just read over the steps again and add Drop: Loop: Helix or
    Drop: Half Loop: Helix where necessary and map it out in your head as you go
    along.

    Almost Done:  I hope this has helped you on your quest to building a dueling
    rollercoaster.  There are just a few things you should remember at all times
    while building these machines.  First, keep speed moderate.  It isn't going
    to help any if you have a super fast dueling rollercoaster.  What's the
    point of being on a dueling rollercoaster if it's too intense?  Intensity is
    a huge factor in dueling rollercoasters.  I should know.  My local theme
    park has a dueling rollercoaster and even though I've never been on it while
    they were running both stations I have seen it in action, and just looking
    at it was more intense than being ON most rides.  Second, these things take
    practice.  If you don't get it the first time just keep trying.  Do you
    think I got an 8.83 on my first dueling rollercoaster?  No!  And neither
    will you.  Half of my first dueling rollercoasters didn't even make it back
    to the station.  Third, if you haven't read it yet, dueling coasters need
    long stations if you want them to have more than one train.  Refer to the
    original Building A Dueling Rollercoaster to show you how to get them
    started, i.e., get a train in each station.
    (again this is by Twitch)

  Greg Wolking sent me this:

    Coasters run faster when they're loaded than they do when they're empty.
    More people = more mass = more inertia, so the coaster picks up more speed
    on drops and carries more speed throughout the entire run. With coasters
    that are attached to the track, this usually isn't too much of a problem
    although if you're already pushing intensity close to the limit (9 or above)
    while testing, a full train can take it beyond the "threshold of pain",
    which you might not discover until it's too late (see below).

    Awareness of this behavior is critical for the design of coasters that are
    not attached to the track such as the bobsled, wooden side-friction, and
    wooden "reverser" coasters. The effect seems more pronounced for the two
    wooden coasters, perhaps because they are only single cars and there is a
    greater difference in mass between an empty car and a full one (more so for
    the reverser, which holds 6 people vs. the side-friction's 4). The problem
    here is that a coaster may test just fine, but fly off the track and crash
    after you open it. Therefore, _save the game before you open the ride_. You
    can generally avoid this problem if you ensure that a coaster is going no
    more than 20-25mph over the crest of a hill during testing, but even that's
    no guarantee. Depending on the nature of the run, a loaded coaster may go as
    much as 10 to 15mph faster than an empty one, especially after a long (more
    than two levels) drop. In addition to watching the speed through the test
    run, check the numbers after testing -- if you get a negative gee of more
    than about 0.30, watch out! Finally, this type of crash seems less likely to
    occur when a coaster stays straight and level at the crest of a hill instead
    of entering a curve (bad) or dropping back down (really bad). The exception
    to this is the bobsled coaster -- entering a curve immediately at the crest
    of a hill will often prevent this type of crash, as the raised wall of the
    curve will usually "catch" the train unless it's going _very_ fast.

    Hint: To get a "real-world" rating of a coaster when it has a full load,
          open the ride and let it run until you've got enough people in the
          queue to fill a train. Pause the game, stop the ride, click the "cars"
          tab, open the drop-list for either the number of trains or number of
          cars, select the current value, then reopen the ride and resume the
          game. You don't actually have to change the parameter -- simply
          choosing an item from either list resets the trains and the ratings
          without emptying the queue, so you'll get a fresh evaluation based on
          the next (full) train through the ride. While the game does update a
          ride's excitement rating dynamically (e.g., if you add theming
          elements while the ride is running, or to show declining excitement as
          the ride gets "stale" due to its age), it does not seem to recalculate
          the intensity or nausea figures unless you do something to reset the
          ratings. Of course, you can also reset the ratings by modifying the
          track but since that dumps the queue, your chance of getting a full
          train on the first run is virtually nil. And, as has been pointed out
          elsewhere, if you have the add-on pack, most guests won't ride an
          untested ride, but that doesn't affect those guests that are already
          in the queue. It only makes passersby "ignore" the ride -- they'll
          pause at the queue entrance, but walk away without entering the queue
          or even thinking about the ride at all!

    Hint: (about Crashes)

          When a coaster crash causes death, your park rating drops no matter
          what you do. However, the amount of the drop depends on the number of
          deaths. So, with "single car" coasters such as wild mouse, side
          friction, etc. that crash when a car stalls at some point on the ride,
          you can reduce the impact on your park rating by either resetting (if
          possible) or demolishing the coaster before any _other_ cars reach
          that point and crash. Since these coasters only carry 2-6 people per
          car, if you catch it on the first crash, the impact on your park
          rating is negligible. Of course, the same theory applies to coasters
          with longer trains but that first crash (don't they always seem to
          happen with full trains?) takes much bigger chunk out of your rating.
          Finally, if you demolish the coaster instead of just resetting it,
          your park rating will recover _much_ more quickly -- once the ride is
          demolished, your remaining guests can't "think" about it any more.

          If the coaster is built entirely above ground (i.e., doesn't go
          through any tunnels) and you have saved the design, you can usually
          rebuild it right away (there's something funky here, perhaps a bug --
          sometimes the game insists on building a saved design with the station
          elevated by one or two levels relative to its position when you saved
          it, so the rebuilt ride is either too tall for its supports or won't
          fit if it weaves through any other rides or footpaths). This might
          cost a couple thousand dollars (depending on the age of the ride) due
          to depreciation, but that's better than having your park rating
          plummet and living with a "dangerous" coaster that (almost) nobody
          wants to ride.

    Re nausea ratings: Extended helixes (more than two full turns in the same
          direction) can raise the nausea rating very quickly. It seems that as
          the coaster continues turning in the same direction, the riders get
          "dizzy" and are about ready to toss their cookies when the track
          finally straightens out. The faster the train is going, the more
          pronounced the effect, and it is _much_ worse when the helix is
          underground (for that matter, all "nausea" effects are magnified for
          underground track sections because the riders can't see what's
          coming). You can reduce the effect somewhat by changing the radius of
          the turn and, if the train isn't going too fast (so the change in
          lateral Gs isn't too great), you can counteract some of this
          "dizziness" by adding a second helix in the opposite direction.

    (again, the above information comes from Greg Wolking)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2.1  The Wild Mouse
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The following information is from Greg Wolking:

    Also, an observation: The "Wild Mouse" coasters seem to have amazing
    longevity -- they don't get "stale" as quickly as other coaster types do.
    In one case, I had a wooden wild mouse coaster that was over 4 years old,
    unmodified since its original construction, priced at $3.00, with guests
    still thinking "really good value!" even after I had to reduce the price of
    newer, larger, more exciting (ratings-wise) coasters to under $2.00 just to
    get people to stop thinking "I'm not paying that much!".

    Guests also seem less likely to "shy away" from a wild mouse that's very
    intense.

    Another note regarding Wild Mouse design: Don't make your station too long!
    If the first car gets back to the station and unloads before the last car
    has left, you're wasting money on those empty cars that haven't left the
    station yet. The more cars on the ride, the more the operating cost. You can
    simply reduce the number of cars, but unless the cars reach the station at
    5mph or less, you're still wasting money because those cars have to traverse
    the full length of the station at only 5mph before they can reload. As a
    result, you're not moving as many people through the ride as you could. You
    can also reduce the interval between the cars by lowering the "Minimum wait
    time", but that increases the risk of crashes unless you design your track
    _very_ carefully.

    Once the ride is open, the cars will get back to the station sooner than
    they will in test mode because full cars carry more speed than empty ones,
    so further adjustments may be necessary. Once you determine the optimum
    number of cars, _and_ those cars reach the platform at more than 5mph,
    reduce the length of the station (e.g., replace station segments with
    straight track) until it's just long enough to hold them all. A properly
    designed and timed Wild Mouse can be a real "money mill" for several
    years -- it doesn't get "stale" as quickly as other coaster types, so unless
    you overprice it to begin with, it will earn its initial admission price
    every 5 seconds (or less, if your track design _safely_ allows a shorter
    interval between the cars) throughout its service life. And, because the
    queue is constantly moving, the guests don't get tired and upset as quickly.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Landscaping
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Landscaping is a very important aspect of RCT, as it makes a park a theme
   park rather than a ratty old carnival.

   Paths:
     Place benches on every 7 to 10 squares of path, more if there is a shop or
     a rollercoaster nearby.  Also place garbage cans on every 10 to 15.  And
     although it isn't as important, place Lamps by all the benches.  And for
     fun you can put "Jumping Fountains" on paths.  (even more fun if you put
     10 or so in a row)  Finally have your paths go near the most exciting parts
     of your most exciting rides.  This is a little "inside" advertising for
     your rides.  Try having a path go through a loop of a rollercoaster, or by
     a drop on the log flume, etc.

   Trees:
     Lining a path with trees is a very good idea in the Summer to keep guests
     from sweltering in the heat (which contributes to them feeling sick).  Also
     place trees around rides to add to their atmosphere.  This also increase
     Excitement on rides.

   Gardens:
     Flowers, Gardens, etc. are the final piece to the puzzle, and make the
     guests a little happier.

   Rides:
     Try to build rides on hilly areas, and use the land to customize your
     rides.  Have a log flume go down a hill and into a tunnel.  Have a steep
     cliff by a sharp turn on a rollercoaster ("oh no we're going to hit that
     cliff!"), etc.  Also skillful use of trees can add to the excitement of
     rides.  (remember the speeder bikes in Return of the Jedi?)

   Themes:

     Mining Theme  use the brown dirt and place the Mining objects around.
                   Also be sure to use the wood support on the land as well.
                   Best used on Mine Rollercoaster.

     Roman         use any type of land.

       Note:  This theme has its own type of Entertainer, the Roman Soldier.
              You can switch to it the same way you switch any entertainer
              costume, by using the middle tab and the pull down menu.
              (Add-On only!)

     Egyptian      use the tan style of land (desert).  Also good on Mine RC.
                   First of two themes to include Lamps.

     Wonderland    use the Checkerboard land (comes with the theme), and try to
                   use the card walls to surround the ride.

     Mars          Red land style.  2nd theme to include lamps.

     Spooky        (Add-On) Works great with brown land or the Brown and Green.

     Jurassic      (Add-On) Works best with the brown and green land.

     Jungle        (Add-On) Green, or green and brown


   If you do some great landscaping you will get several bonuses:  One, you
   will be voted the "Most Beautiful Park", and Two you will get guests who
   take pictures of your breathtaking park. (the other way to get them to take
   pictures is to name one of them "Chris Sawyer)  Another benefit of good
   landscaping is that it will increase your park value AND your park rating!
   Note: Fences do not increase Excitement ratings on rides.
   Note: Landscaping will only effect rides up to 4 squares away.

   Gardens:
     If you build gardens away from the path, make sure to have a lawnmowing
     Handyman also able to water the gardens, as any other handymen are latched
     onto the path and will never leave it.  (Ake Malmgren)

   The Banner (Add-On):
     The Banner can only be placed on flat paths, and is used to tell guests
     when they have entered a new area of the park.  But far more useful is its
     ability to act as a STOP sign (or more accurately, a NO ADMITTANCE sign)
     to the guests, preventing them from going that way!  This essentially acts
     as a One Way sign, guests can leave from behind the banner, but can't go
     through the banner.  This is especially useful when you want to develop
     your park one area at a time, you just leave banners blocking off areas of
     the park that you are going to fill in later, so you don't have guests
     wandering around there.

  Entrance Options (Add-On)

    With Loopy Landscapes, you are now able to change the Entrances to the Rides
    in your park.  This is actually more of a landscaping option, although the
    option is available on each ride's panel.  Here is a list of the theme
    options:

      - Plain Style Entrance/Station
      - Canvas Tent Style Entrance/Station
      - Castle Style Entrance/Station (brown)
      - Castle Style Entrance/Station (grey)
      - Log Cabin Entrance/Station
      - Wooden Style Entrance/Station
      - Jungle Style Entrance/Station
      - Classic/Roman Style Entrance/Station
      - Pagoda Style Entrance Station
      - Abstract Style Entrance/Station
      - Snow/Ice Style Entrance/Station
      - Space Style Entrance/Station

    Note: This affects both the Entrance of the ride, as well as the Stations
          (where applicable).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Shops
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The important thing here is saturation.  What do I mean?  You must have at
   least one of each type in every segment of your park.  A large park would
   have 8 segments, medium 6, small 4, etc.  (a segment being a small area of
   your park)  In each segment place a food stand (pizza, burger, fries) or two,
   a drinks stand, a dessert stand (cotton candy, ice cream), a bathroom, and
   either a Information Kiosk or a Souvenir stand.  This allows the guests to
   easily find what they need when they need it.  The longer they need it the
   more unhappy they become.  Also buddy shops up, place a drinks stand by a
   fries stand.  Finally by every shop that sells a food item of any kind, place
   numerous benches, and a few garbage cans.  People like to sit when they eat.

   A * in the notes indicates that although that is a food shop, it doesn't
   leave any litter!

   A ! in the notes indicates that this is an Add-On only shop.

   Food Courts, Why You Shouldn't Build Them:
     Food courts may sound like a wonderful idea to you.  After all, you may
     have grown up seeing them in malls, amusement parks, and maybe even at your
     school.  But in Rollercoaster Tycoon, they just aren't that effective at
     what they need to accomplish, that is, serving food.  For example, if you
     were to build a food court, only a few of the shops would actually do good
     business.  The rest (like ice cream) get ignored.  Also food courts tend
     to get guests lost in great numbers.  So avoid building these.  Instead,
     spread your shops out along the paths.  Put at most, 3 shops together, and
     try to make them different.  Like a Fries next to a Drinks, or a Pizza
     next to an Ice Cream.

   Tip: (from Ake Malmgren)
     If you have many shops/stalls next to the park entrance, it may cause
     guests not to find the park exit. (they think that they don't find it, but
     they usually find it a few seconds later) This will give a lot of messages
     like "Guest xxx is lost and can't find the park exit", which is quite
     annoying.  (Ed note: This is probably due to the Guests' Pathfinding
     algorithim getting all messed up with all those intersections that shops
     create!)

   Balloon/Umbrella Colors (Add-On):
     You can change the Balloon colors in the shop window, simply click the
     colors tab and change the color.  Each shop can have its own distinctive
     color so you can easily tell where each guest bought their balloons.  This
     works the same for Umbrellas at the Information Kiosks and Souvenir Stands.
     With the Loopy Landscapes Expansion Pack, there are now 32 different colors
     to choose from for balloons.

   Note: Variety is somewhat important when building food shops.  People like a
         choice between whether to have Cotton Candy or a Burger, so build more
         than one food shop in the same area.  You may often want to build 3 or
         4 even.

   Note: Placing Souvenir Stands and Balloon Stands near the exits of your
         most popular rides may help you sell those items better (happy people
         are more likely to buy things!).

   Note: Never charge people to use the Bathrooms unless you want your guests
         to leave your park.  Bathrooms should be a FREE service of your park!

   Note: A new feature with the second Add-On, Loopy Landscapes, is the option
         to make all stalls of one type have the same prices.  For example, all
         Coffee Shops in your park would be selling Coffee for the same price.

7. Alternative Ideas
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   I know this is a strange name for a section.  I'm not even entirely sure why
   I named it that, so live with it.  This section contains ideas so strange
   that they had to be given their own section.

   Park Design Fun:
   ----------------
     The Mega-Shop Approach:
       This is probably more expensive than it is worth, but if you've already
       done everything you could try this.  The basic idea is to have a path
       that does a big circle around your entire park.  We make it a double
       path with a space in between the two paths.  Then in the space in between
       we build 2 burger huts, one facing one path, the other the other path.
       Then 2 Drink Huts done in the same manner, and on through the shops.
       Then build a path to connect the two parallel paths, and build an inform-
       ation kiosk on that path.  Then continue until the entire loop is like
       that.  You can build all the rides you want on the outside and inside of
       the loop.  Then build nothing but benches and garbage cans on the paths.
       And on any space by a path that isn't taken up by a ride or a queue, put
       a garden or a fountain.

     The Alcatraz Approach:
       Here's something fun to try if you need to have a number of guests in
       your park to pass the scenario.  First build 4 paths in a square (so it
       would be 2x2), then raise the terrain around it to create "walls".
       Finally place fences on the top of the walls, and then create a little
       moat around the walls.  You have your own little prison!  So whenever you
       find a guest who is thinking "I wanna go home" or "I can't find the exit"
       pick them up and place them in the prison.  Then they can't EVER leave,
       and your guest count stays the same!  Oh, and be aware that this will
       effect your Park Rating/Value but not significantly (unless you put a
       LOT of people in there).

     Alcatraz Modified:
       Similar to the first Alcatraz, but instead of putting the peeps in your-
       self, you have several rides exit into the "prison".  The downside is
       that you have a lot of peeps in there with money that they can never ever
       spend.

     Alcatraz even more modified: (from Ake Malmgren)
       Build a food shop, dessert shop, drink stall and bathroom by the prison to
       get the rest of the guests money. Put in an entertainer and a jumping
       fountain to make them happy, and a handyman to keep the prison clean.
       Then you can put in more guests without dropping the park rating too
       much.

     The "You Can Never Leave" Approach:
       So you wanna keep guests in your park, but that Alcatraz idea seems like
       too much work.  Well here's another idea.  Have 3 types of rides near
       your entrance, a Gentle Ride, a Small Coaster, and a Big Coaster.  Have
       each of the ride exits lead to an area that is completely inaccessible
       from the Park Entrance.  Once they ride one of your rides they will be
       in the new area, and will be unable to go back or ever leave your park!
       An alternate way to do this (Add-On only!) is to simply use a Banner to
       block off the exit to the park.

       Downside:  This really agitates the peeps who are in your park, and you
                  can watch as your park rating plummets into the ground!

     The Old Remove the Exit Trick:
       If you need to keep a certain number of peeps in your park, but you don't
       know whether you can do it, simply remove the path leading to the exit
       once you have enough guests in your park.  The downside?  No one new can
       enter your park!

   Ride Design Fun:
   ----------------
     The "No Lift" Approach:
       This is pretty simple, really.  Right out of the station build 5-10
       booster tracks, each set to the maximum speed (67 mph on a Corkscrew
       coaster) then you can shoot it up the hills.  If you do it right you
       won't need a single lift hill.

     The layered Rides Approach:
       This involves building several (4+) rides in a single area or land.  Your
       first ride needs to be very spread out along the land.  Have large drops
       and wide open areas on both sides.  Have the ride cover a lot of ground
       as well.  Build the second on the same idea.  Have the 2 rides interlock
       a little.  Loops interlocking other Loops are always fun.  Then with your
       next rides, just try your hardest to interlock them with your other rides
       at every possible opportunity.  Build as many rides as you can this way
       to increase excitement on a lot of rides.

     Layered Rides Modified:
       A slight change in strategy to the Layered Rides approach.  Build several
       small non-coaster rides like the Merry-Go-Round.  Then simply build a
       rollercoaster OVER those rides, and have its entrance by the entrance to
       the Merry-Go-Round.  Saves space, and people have a good choice of rides.

     Teeny Tiny Rides:
       -- modified from alt.games.rctycoon  (David Keenan & Scott Amspoker)
       I discussed this a little earlier in section 3, where I mentioned tiny
       Hedge Mazes and Go Karts.  Well that's not all that you can do with Tiny
       Rides.  Try the Tiny Coaster.  Build something simple like a station
       followed by a helix up, then a vertical loop, another vertical loop (this
       time in the opposite direction) finished by a helix down and into the
       station.  Then set it to Powered Launch mode, and have fun!

   Working the Pause:
   ------------------
   Just because you can't build rides while paused doesn't mean that you can't
   do anything while paused.  You can do the following things while paused:
       Hire new employees AND set their routes
       Rename Guests
       Change the Prices of rides and shops
       Close Rides and change their attributes
           (Guests on the ride will still get off the ride, however)
       Take out/Repay loans
       Alter Research Priorities and funding
       Pick up Guests (useful if you accidentally drown a bunch of them)
   So if you need to get something on that list done and you don't have a lot
   of time to spare, just pause it and do it!

   Change the Game Sounds:
   -----------------------
   You can listen to (and change) the ambient noise sound in the game.  In your
   RCT directory in the folder DATA, change the name of CSS2.DAT to CSS2.WAV
   and you can listen to it (and edit it) in a wav player of any kind.  Also
   you can change any sound you want to CSS2.DAT and it will be in the game.
   (UNTESTED)  If you do that make sure to back up the sound before you monkey
   with it!

   The other game sounds you can only edit if you have done a full install.
   CSS3.DAT is the Bumper Cars sound
   CSS4.DAT through CSS14.DAT are Merry-Go-Round sounds (except 10 and 12)

   All must be PCM 8bit 22khz and Stereo to work.

   One site (http://members.xoom.com/scifihigh/firstpark/music2.html) has a
   small archive of alternate sounds for the Bumper Cars.  (like the Village
   People's YMCA, or a Jazzy beat)

   How to Change the Game Speed: (Hex Editor)
   ------------------------------------------
     ** originally posted by Surfyxx onto alt.games.rctycoon (slightly edited)

   Although there is no explicit option to change the game speed in RCT, you can
   change it with a little Hex Editing!

     ======================================================================
     Warning:  This has not been tested by me, so do this at your own risk!
     ======================================================================

   Here's how you do it:
     - Make a copy of RCT.EXE (name it RCT_backup.exe or something)
     - Open rct.exe with any hex editor
     - Search for the sequence:
         83 F8 19 (hex)
       There should be only one place that matches this sequence, independent of
       the program versions or file length.  If there are more, just try out
       each one until you get it right!
     - 19 (or decimal: 25) is the important value to change the gamespeed, and
       can now be changed according to your wishes:
         from 0 (faster) to 25 (default) up to 100 (slower)
     **Caution**:  values between 101 and 255 will make RCT very very slowly,
       and sometimes it won't even start.  So the best values are between 0 and
       100.
     - After changing to the new value, save the new rct.exe, leave hex editor,
       and play!

  The following Tips are from Greg Wolking:

    Here's a few hints you might consider including, especially for those who
    are intent on "beating" the scenarios without actually "hacking" saved
    files, etc. in order to "cheat". The basic idea is to get your coasters
    built without burning a lot of time off the game clock, leaving you more
    time to handle other aspects of park management.

    1. The game runs a lot slower in a window than it does full-screen. The
       game's elapsed time is keyed to how fast it can animate the coasters,
       characters, etc. but this does not have any noticeable effect on how
       quickly you can build a custom ride. So, switch the game to run in a
       window when building. Even better, switch your display to the highest
       resolution you can tolerate (i.e., still see what you're doing), maximize
       the window and, if there are guests visible as you build, do so at
       maximum zoom (individual guests are not animated at lower zoom levels).
       In other words, the more stuff there is to animate, the slower the game
       time passes. The difference is quite noticeable, even on my 400MHz
       Pentium II box.

    2. Save the game before you start designing a custom ride. Take your time,
       save the track when you're done, then go back and build the saved track
       at one shot. Drawbacks are when you have to modify the terrain to
       accommodate the ride (so, if possible, pick a good spot that doesn't
       require you to dig up a lot of ground, chop a lot of trees, etc.), and
       the fact that you can't build a "prefab" coaster which goes through a
       tunnel, even if you demolish it and try to rebuild it in the same spot,
       so:

    3. "Walk" through the entire track and write down the steps to build it.
       Thus, you can build it a lot faster when you go back to your saved
       position. Unless you're _really_ good at building coasters "on the fly",
       this can save you weeks or months of game time, provided that you have
       the cash available (unless your park is a real dog, you're earning money
       while you build). I'm currently working on a utility that will "decode" a
       saved track file and produce a simple text file with step-by-step
       instructions for building that track. I'll let you know when it's done,
       as it can be really handy for rebuilding some of the tracks that come
       with the scenarios, such as the triple-racer in the Three Monkeys Park
       scenario -- if you want to really develop the park beyond the end of the
       scenario, this is the only way to replace such coasters when they get old
       and unreliable.

    One last tip: When you're really tight on space and must build a queue line
    that's adjacent to a "main" footpath, just demolish the adjacent section of
    footpath, build the queue line, then rebuild the footpath starting at the
    point where you want the queue to attach.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Cheats:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   There isn't a real need to cheat in this game, but sometimes it's fun to just
   build coasters without having to worry about space or money.  So here's a
   cheat or two for you.

   You can find various Game Trainers (cheats) at the following place:

     http://rct.gametropics.com/

   It does not need to be in the RCT directory, it merely needs to be running
   while you play the game.

   Bear in mind that I didn't make either Trainer here, so I know little about
   them and how they work.  Also keep in mind that I have the US version, so
   I have never seen any of the UK versions work.  (in case you are wondering,
   I did download them, but couldn't get it to run, and I have heard some
   horror stories about it as well, so run at your own risk) Finally, these
   trainers may not work with all versions of the game.  Although the US
   trainer is supposed to.

   There are some easter eggs in the game as well:

      Rename a guest to one of these names

       Chris Sawyer -- Will take pictures of your rides
       Simon Foster -- Will paint pictures of your rides
       Melanie Warn -- Increases the guest to completely happy
       Katie Brayshaw -- Will wave to everyone she meets
       John Wardley -- Says "Wow!" when he sees (or is on) a good coaster
       John Mace -- Gets on your rides for free (it was reported that he would
                    pay 2x the cost on rides, but he didn't for me!)
       Damon Hill -- Races around twice as fast on the Go Karts
       Michael Schumacher -- Works the same as Damon Hill, but a little faster
                             (and NO you can't race Damon and Michael!)
       Mr Bean -- Will drive VERY slowly on the Go Karts

   Cheats which do NOT work: (at least they didn't for me)

     It was widely circulated on the net that you could get $5k a month by
     doing this: Press 'F' to bring up the finance screen, then press 'M' +
     ENTER.  However, this doesn't work, and is likely a hoax.

     Also at one time GameSpot reported that you could use HORZA or DEMO as a
     way to cheat.  Well that is the Theme Park cheat, not a RCT cheat.

     The Adrenaline Vault reported that at the Main Menu, if you pressed and
     held SHIFT then typed 'rct2' that it would activate some in game cheat.  I
     tried this and it did not work!

     Again, these cheats do NOT WORK.  They fail!  I add this because I still
     get emails about these...

     Also there are NO IN GAME CHEATS!  That means that no entering in some
     bizarre code to pass the game instantly, or any such thing.  So don't email
     me about that either!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.1  RCT Utilities (non-cheats)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This section is devoted to all of those little programs floating around the
   net, which are not cheats, but are designed to enhance the game.  Since none
   of these were designed by me, if you have problems with them, you should
   email their authors.  These programs are the property of their authors, and
   are to be used as described in their documentation.

   Coaster Central
     Coaster Central is another ride utility, which is similar to RCT 
     Explorer.  Coaster Central offers a little more information on a track 
     than that of RCT Explorer.  Then again, RCT Explorer offers info on 
     Saved Games and Scenarios, which gives it a little something extra.  
     Coaster Central offers a list of the track pieces used to create a 
     track.  This would be helpful if say you wanted to use someone's track 
     design, but build it into a hillside, and you wanted to keep the 
     originality of the ride.

   Image Converter BMP (169k download)
     This little utility takes any bitmap image and converts it to the TP4
     format which is used in the game.  To use it first, take a screenshot of
     your ride (from a good enough zoom so that you can see the whole ride).
     The screenshot will save in PCX format.  Now you have to use an imaging
     program to reformat the PCX as a BMP.  Then you can run this program, and
     transfer the BMP into a TP4!

   Image Converter PCX (119k download)
     Similar to the first image converter, this one takes a PCX image rather
     than a BMP, which is handy since RCT takes screenshots using the PCX
     format.  Use the medium zoom to take the picture of your ride (make sure
     to get it all on screen), and then run the program.  Place the Box around
     the ride completely, and save.  When saving make sure to save into your
     TRACKS directory using the same name as the ride for which this picture
     is to be used.  (ex: if your ride is FIZZLY.td4, you should save it as
     FIZZLY.tp4)

   RCT Explorer (308k download)
     RCT Explorer is a handy tool if you have a bunch of RCT files lying around,
     and you've got no idea what's in them or you're just trying to organize
     them in a particular manner.  This utility will allow you to view some
     of the major statistics and facts in three file types: track file (.td4),
     saved game file (.sv4), and scenario file (.sc4).

   RCT Reader (110k download) -- Updated 8-15-99
     This program, which has been recently updated, can look at all the stats of
     your rides directly in your tracks directory.  So if you just downloaded a
     set of 100 coasters, and you want to see which the best are, you can run
     this and see.  This latest version (2.2.0) also supports Zip Files.

   RCT Track Decoder (144k download)
     This utility will both "mirror" and "reverse" a track.  It will also
     decode the track file into a simple set of track elements, thus showing
     you how it was constructed.  You can also export the instructions as
     plain ASCII text, which you can view or print out in NotePad or WordPad.

   Saved Game Modifier (177k download)
     This program will allow you to build rides underground and do a few
     things to your scenery, such as take double-wide tarmac paths and convert
     them into a road.

   Scenario Editor (367k download -- NO LONGER OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED)
     This little gem allows you to create your own real scenarios, not just the
     saved game wannabe-scenarios!  Here is a list of what it allows you to do:
       - Set the name of the Scenario and the name of the Park
       - Set the Goals for the Scenario - Number of Guests and Rating or Park
         Value or Just for Fun. You can set the number of years to play for the
         first two choices.
       - Set the starting Cash, Loan and Maximum Loan amounts
       - Place the Park Entrance Gate
       - Place one or two locations where guests walk onto the map
       - Set the boundaries of the park and the other types of land available in
         the game
       - Plant or Remove Trees - more than one-at-a-time!
       - Enable or Disable all Rides and Attractions
       - Set the order that the R&D department develops new stuff
       - Randomize the order in which Rides, Attractions, Special Track elements
         and Scenery and Themeing objects become available during the game
     Remember that this is not an endorsed RCT product, and as such, may not
     run on your system.  (i.e. it may cause your game to crash!)

   TD4 Changer (354k download)
     This is a nifty little utility that will take a track file, and allow
     you to literally put just about ANY kind of ride vehicle on it.  Some
     work better than others, of course, but this is a very cool utility.

     Author:    James Hughes
     Web Site:  http://www.strategyplanet.com/rctuk/tid

   TD4 Mirror (148k download)
     This program will allow you to take a mirror image of one track.  The
     mirror image will be a second track file.  This utility is commonly used
     to produce dueling and racing coasters.

   TD4 SpeedUp (134k download)
     This program will take an ordinary track file and give it the trains a BIG
     boost in speed.  Actually, the speed is customizable, but it can really
     send the trains along the track quickly.

   TD4 Viewer (133k download)
     This program will allow you to see what your track looks like outside
     RCT.  It allows you to rotate the track on an X and Y axis, and allows
     for a near 3D view.

     Author:    James Hughes
     Web Site:  http://www.strategyplanet.com/rctuk/tid

   Workbench (Size varies on version)
     Workbenches allow people to play the game without having to worry about
     keeping up with the "gameplay" of a scenario.  A workbench will come with
     plenty of cash (typically $10 Million) and full access to all scenery and
     rides.  It's basically a free-for-all, if you will.  There are multiple
     examples of Workbenches, and you can find a few on my RCT site.

   Utility Rumors:
     Save Game Editor, this may never happen, but supposedly Conrad Feinson from
     the above Image Converter is working on it.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Bugs!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Ah, Bugs.  These are sorted by seriousness, with the most serious at the top
   and the kinda annoying near the bottom.  Most of these here are merely
   annoying.  Looking at this list may make you think that Rollercoaster Tycoon
   is a buggy game, it is not.  It has taken 5 months and dozens of people to
   find all these bugs, and they are almost all very minor.

   Most of these bugs were originally reported before the Add-On was released,
   and it is not known whether they still exist!

   Really Bad Bugs:
   ----------------
     JR Brewin sent me this:
       "Now, I'm not sure if you can replicate this, But what I did was there
       was park with a go kart ride, and I wanted to reverse which way the cars
       go round it, without rebuilding the whole ride.  So, I removed the
       station sections, added a new station by building a NEW ride, and then
       joined the tracks together.  This totally froze my pc.  Which wasn't
       nice.  Note, the station from the new ride joined up to the track of the
       old ride just fine."
     Dan Mullin had this to add:
       "Concurring with JR's observations.  I was using monos in MegaPark for
       high speed transport to different areas of the park.  I made the mistake
       of building two shuttle monos going opposite directions and butted the
       ends of the station platforms up to each other.  The game crashed."
     And Ake Malmgren had this to add:
       "If you're trying to build any sort of station platforms back to back
       (like Dan Mullin did with the monorail) the game will lock/crash.  It
       doesn't seem to matter which sort of station platforms it is, they can
       even be completely different (e.g. chairlift and car ride)."

     This one just happened to me:
       I was building the Reverse Whoa Belly rollercoaster (a.k.a. the Reverse
       Freefall), and while building the vertical section of the coaster, I
       pressed the 'forward track' button, and that caused the game to crash.

     Steph sent me this:
       "This seems to happen with my fiancÅEs and my computer.  We have the
       multimedia keyboard.  On my machine, if I try to turn my volume up, the
       game crashes.  On my fiancÅEs computer, if I have mute on, then go to
       save, it will crash (right AFTER saving)."

     Every once in awhile you might get a GSK Exception Trapper Error.  This
     could be caused by old versions of DirectX.  You should upgrade to
     DirectX 6.1 to correct the problem.  Most new games come with this, so
     you could install from a game CD, or download from the Microsoft web site
     (or pretty much any other gaming related web site).  (untested)  However,
     this isn't a guaranteed solution.
     -- from alt.games.rctycoon (Kip)

     This one happened to me after the Add-On was installed.  I was playing
     along normally, then decided to open up ICQ, which caused RCT to crash.
     Very annoying as I had just build a great new coaster!

     Kenneth R Smith sent me this:
       "When building a hedge maze, if you remove all of it, but the
       construction arrow is still visable, then stop construction, the box for
       the ride pops up, but no ride exists, start the ride, and the game will
       crash."

     Ake Malmgren sent me this:
       "If you save any ride with four station platforms and try to use the
       design, the track will not appear when you click to place it.  A
       construction window for water slide will appear, but you can't construct
       anything.  The text in the title bar for this window will be the
       description of the wooden RC. If you click on the 'Entrance' button, the
       game will crash."

     The Dreamkeeper sent me this:
       I found a bug in RCT. First, build a really short Woah Belly! then put
       it to it's highest speed. Then find someone going on the ride. 'I' him
       and have his box up on the screen. Watch the Woah Belly! car fly into
       the air and at the exact second it hits the ground the game will crash
       with some weird warning.

   Really Annoying Bugs:
   ---------------------
     This bug occurs after a daylight savings time or summer time (whatever)
     switch (who knows why) which causes your data to become "lost".  Your saves
     will still be there, but your progress through the scenarios is gone.  Fear
     not!  If you have saved each scenario after having completed it, then go
     to the official web page "http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com" and download
     the small utility:
       "http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com/test/patches/rctrec.exe"
     Then merely run it and everything should be fine.
     Note: Your name will disappear from the scenario listings.

     Ake Malmgren sent me this:
       "If the beginning of a multiple car train (RC or transport) enters a
       second station platform before the end of the train has left the first
       platform, the game will think this is the same platform, the train status
       will be 'Departing station' and the train will not stop there.  If all
       station platforms is built like this, the train will just keep going
       round and round."

   Small Bugs, Glitches, Etc.
   --------------------------
     I just caught this one:
       I wanted to kick everyone (2000+ guests) out of my park so that I could
       experiment with custom rollercoasters.  It took forever to get people
       out.  But finally I noticed that I had gotten into "Negative Guests",
       that is it said I had "-1 guests" then "-5 guests" all the way to "-22
       guests".  I'm not sure why this happened, but I'm pretty sure that this
       is a bug.
       Dan Mullin had this to add:
         "I also witnessed negative guests.  I got bored with Pokie Park and
         started drowning everyone in the lake.  It appears that, though your
         mechanics, handymen,  etc are not listed in the guest totals at the
         bottom of the page they are still tracked as part of the population.
         Kill everyone then kill a mechanic and your guest total will hit -1."
       So what do you do when you suspect that the Guest Counter in the lower
       left is giving you false information?  You open up the Guest Menu (by
       pushing the Guest Button of course) and it has the "Real" count of how
       many guests are in your park.

     One Graphical Glitch:
       I'm sure you've noticed some odd graphics "bugs" things that show through
       the foreground when they are in the background, etc.  One thing I noticed
       was on a coaster I had just designed.  The third train was half off the
       station platform, and so the final car on it was on an angle.  That car
       couldn't decide if it was at an angle, like the track, or horizontal,
       like the rest of the train; and it kept going back and forth.  Up.  Down.

     Andy Fey sent me some German Translation errors:
       1.) Translation-Error in the German version: If you set "play music" in
           the options-menu, you don't hear any music.  If you set "Don't play
           music", you hear the music.
       2.) In the window with the thoughts of the people there is sometimes
           this:  "I don't have to use the bathroom".  But if you click to one
           of the persons thoughts, they have to use the bathroom really badly.

     Roderik van de Logt sent this Dutch Translation error:
       "If you want to remove a tree, you have to click on the tree with the
       right mouse button, but on the Status Bar at the underside states that
       you must click the left button.  I tried this and it does not work."

     Tadhg Pearson reports that there is a bug involving early Pentium II
     machines that causes the game to crash on opening.  As of this writing
     there is no patch available for this.

     There is a bug that involves the 3D Cinema.  If you have the early version
     (it ends with 64) then the 3D Cinema can only hold a maximum of 8 people
     despite being listed as having a maximum of 20.  A later version (65)
     corrected this but there is no patch available.  You will just have to
     learn to cope.

     Andy Fey sent these 2 bugs in as well:
       1.)  Build a long station of a rollercoaster.  At the end of the station
            add 7 pieces of a straight way with chains.  Now build the entrance
            and the exit and select "inverse incline" and start the test-mode.
            The wagons are overtaking themselves and making strange things.
       2.)  Go Karts: Build a track which is not a closed circuit.  Select
            "Continuous Circuit mode".  If you want to open the Go Karts a
            message appears that tells you that you have to build a closed
            circuit.  But if you select "Race Mode" you can open the Karts
            without this message.

     Lasse Hedegaard sent me this:
       "If you're making a rollercoster thru a tunnel that's 1x1 square, and the
       corner is 90 degrees in 1 square (I think the coaster is called Wild Mice
       RC) - you can't see thru the tunnel - and it seems that the track stops
       there - but the train goes thru..."

       Note: Go Karts has the same effect.

     Matt Linden sent me this:
       "Build any type of ride/stall.  Right-click on it and bulldoze it (not
       demolish) completely...leave the construction window open and place it in
       a different location.  Left-click on it to bring up the window and set to
       'overall view', and it will still show the original location."

     Lerdahl Petter sent me this:
       "After starting the game a small vertical piece of the screen (looks like
       the size of MS Office shortcutmenu bar.)  is showing on left side of the
       screen.  This on occasion updates with a piece of the screen.  So if you
       have a ride window in that part of the screen and you have turned the
       ride on you can be fooled into thinking that the ride has not started.
       This problem can also appear if the office toolbar is not loaded."

     Keith Edwards sent me this:
       "If you make a raised water tile on the ground, drop a person in it, then
       remove the water tile, they will appear to drown in the ground.  It is
       funny."

     Ake Malmgren sent me this:
       "I've encountered various bugs when building custom hedge mazes:
       Sometimes, if I forget to build entrance and exit and close the
       construction window, the entire maze disappears.  This happened more
       often before, for some reason.  If I try to open a maze which doesn't
       have entrance or exit, the main window will center at the edge of the
       map.  Once I built a steel rollercoaster which ended high up in the air,
       and when I started to construct a maze the construction marker appeared
       at the end of the rollercoaster.  When I then tried to build, I got the
       'too high for supports' error."

     And Ake also sent me this:
       "When running the game in a window it will not cover the full width
       of the screen:  if the window is wide enough there will be a black
       field on the right side, that will only be filled when scrolling
       the main view.  Then everything in that field freeze."

     And Ake also sent me this:
       "When constructing a vertical roller coaster you may build a banked
       corner that leads right into a steep drop. It is allowed to build, but
       the track elements will not fit together and the circuit will be broken."
       Note: In other words, the game lets you build it, but it won't let you
             test it, or open it!

     And Ake also sent me this:
       "If you have over 2500-3000 guests (I'm not certain about the exact
       number) you can't scroll down the list over all guests."

     And Ake also sent me this list of Graphical Glitches:
     "There are many graphical glitches in the game, because it uses
      sprites. Examples are:
        + Rides going underground next to the wall are sometimes visible through
          the wall.
        + Suspended rollercoasters seems to be above the ground or go
          into solid walls when entering/exiting tunnels.
        + Riders on the single-rail rollercoaster bang their heads when
          entering tunnels or going under other rides.
        + Water slide looks to be full of holes when a turn touches a steep
          ground slope.
        + The large Monorail train looks odd while turning.
        + Rides seem to intersect themselves/each other when passing.
        + If a car crash underground the scrap will fly up through the
          ground."

      Mikoz Groelz sent me this:
        "If you attach the ride exit to a sloping path up like this / the guest
        will come out, make a jump, maybe, and walk on. Although, the message
        says you're exit isn't attached to a path."

   Really Bizarre "Design" flaws:
   ------------------------------
     NMartin sent me a coaster that ran literally backwards.  Here's what he
     did.  Build a small Mini Steel rollercoaster, and finish by having a steep
     drop, then another steep incline to go into the rear of the station. (so
     that it will "dip" just before hitting the station)  Then set the coaster
     to "Reverse Incline Launch Shuttle Mode".  Here's what should happen, the
     train will go backwards, drop down the hill, and come back up.  But it
     won't be able to make it all the way up and will go back down.  But now it
     thinks that it is in the station, and will proceed backwards throughout the
     entire ride at "station speed".  Very very strange!  If you would like to
     see a picture of this, or to download the savegame itself, check out my
     website at http://manymoose.8m.com/coaster/

   I have heard a lot of reports of the game colors getting all messed up,
   turning all pink and whatnot.  According to Microprose, this is caused by
   bad (meaning old) drivers.  Usually this problem goes away when you save it,
   or if you do an ALT-TAB.  I'm not aware of any permanent solutions.
     Sean Malloy had this to add:
     "This appears to be a palette problem. I run a program that periodically
     swaps background images on my desktop; whenever that happens while I'm
     playing RCT, the colors go wonky. The problem appears to be due to Windows
     calculating a new color palette when the background image is changed, and
     RCT not getting the new color mapping until you do something to force it
     (i.e., selecting Load or Save, which pops up a dialog box in the Windows
     colors, resetting RCT's palette.
     "The effect is repeatable using a slide show program to view a bunch of
     images; when the image changes, even if it's running invisibly in the
     background, it recalculates the palette and RCT's colors go screwy."

   Ake Malmgren sent me this:
     "I got an rc from extreme rct that showed a weird bug:

     Build a station platform of steel rc at for example height 10. At the back
     of the station, make a steep drop down to height 1, then steep up as tall
     as it gets.  Like this:

      \
       \        SSSSSSSSSS>  <the front end of the station shall not go anywhere
        \      /
         \    /
          \__/  <track

     Set the rc at 'Reverse incline-launched shuttle mode', and let the guests
     ride it.  This will happen:

     The rc will start normally and drop backwards, go a bit up the hill, down
     again and the front of the train (if the rc is made right) will go into the
     station platform.. The game will now think that the train is at the station
     and will run backwards at station speed (like the one NMartin sent you, as
     described under "Design flaws") But when the train reaches the end of the
     track, all guests will leave it and walk through the air into the ride
     exit.  Then the train will go back to the station platform, still at
     station speed.  A version of this rc can be found at Extreme RCT
     (http://www.thelawsons.com/RCT) It's called "FLoating peep coaster" on this
     page."

   I have also heard reports of the game crashing when you click the Right Mouse
   button.  From what I understand this is caused by your Mouse Driver, simply
   uninstall the driver, and install a Basic Mouse driver of some sort.

   If your game freezes, try turning the sound off.
   
   
 Are there other programs I can download to prevent crashes? (by Chain)
 -----------------------------------------------------------
   
   I've discovered that if you play RCT and frequently suffer errors and bugs
   that cause the program to freeze & crash related to DirectDraw (and maybe
   other programs), using Norton Crashguard can alleviate these errors.  A lot
   of times the "crash" occurs once or twice, I revive the game using the
   program, and then for the remainder of the gameplay, I'm not interrupted by
   crashes.  I'm positive it even stops with continual use.
   
   Norton Crashguard, however is NO substitute for proper software maintenance.
   It should be used as a last resort "I don't know why this thing is crashing
   even though everything is up to date, and my PC is fully capable of handling
   this"
   
   Use cnet's Catchup program at catchup.cnet.com to get your drivers and
   software fully updated and in gear.
   
   Defragmenting the Hard drive is a good way to boost the efficiency of your
   programs.  This does not solve any phyiscal bugs with programs, but it can
   alleviate certain "out of memory" problems.  removing programs that start up
   with your computer is one way.  PLEASE BEWARE TECH SUPPORTS THAT OFFER THIS
   METHOD AS A WAY OF SOLVING A PROBLEM!  ASK FOR A SUPERVISOR!
   
   (windows)
   Upgrade your Java Virtual Machine. An upgrade [especially from an old one]
   can provide new "shortcuts" which can speed up your computer's processing
   capabilities, as well as fix minor problems related to graphical drawing
   capabilties.
   available at microsoft.com.  Good luck, I go through hell trying to find it.
   LOL
   
   (windows)
   Registry cleaners are very effective (especially after first time and after
   major uninstalls).  They can remove invalid keys which may be causing
   problems, as well as decrease boot time and program load time.  I recommend
   the one from http://www.pcmech.com/article.htm?shopvac (available as FREE
   source code only), since it works better than any 3rd party program, its very
   small [doesn't exceed 1Kb], and uses your own computers DOS functions and
   switches to achieve maximum results instead of a 3rd party's predefined
   definitions of a "bad key". (your computer knows what's wrong with it better
   than somebody else, to put in other words.)  However the downside is for a
   more thorough cleaning, it takes more time.  Win98+ have DOS command:
   "Scanreg /fix" [no "" marks] function (not the same, but faster than all of
   the above).  Use "Scanreg /opt" [no "" marks] after the fix to compress the
   registry a little further.
   
   Please beware of overclocking.  This is done by changing physical hardware
   settings to exceed a safe margin.  This strains hardware, and can lead to
   burnout.  None of the methods I have mentioned above (with the exception of
   Cnet's driver database) may change your hardware settings around.  The advice
   above is detailed methods on how to remove junk data that can be cluttering
   important files.  The efficiency level of a computer can be boosted above
   100% the normal without overclocking the computer via software data quality
   improvement.
   
   This was strictly advice, and should be performed only by an experienced
   computer user.  The author nor the host/creator/author of the FAQ of these

                           Frequently Asked Questions
================================================================================

  .----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
  | Q:  My park rating is going down!  What can I do about this?               |
  |                                                                            |
  | A:  The park rating is just a composite of how the guests feel about the   |
  |     park.  If it is raining, this may experience a small dip (they can't   |
  |     go on roller coasters in the rain).  Also your park may be dirty,      |
  |     overcrowded, and have long lines.  Hire a handyman, build a new ride   |
  |     to siphon people away, and cut the lines.  Also hire an entertainer or |
  |     two to patrol your longer line queues.  Finally overhaul your rides,   |
  |     paint them, add to them, advertise about them, whatever it takes to    |
  |     get people excited again.  If your value drops for no apparent reason, |
  |     the most likely cause is litter.                                       |

  | Q:  How can I increase my Park Value?                                      |
  |                                                                            |
  | A:  Park Value is an estimation of how valuable your park is.  This isn't  |
  |     a simple sum of all of your rides, but also includes how popular your  |
  |     park is, and how old your rides are.  So how do you increase your Park |
  |     Value?  First replace the really old rides with new ones (even if its  |
  |     the same ride).  For example, bulldoze your Merry-Go-Round, and build  |
  |     a new one.  This isn't too expensive, and will also allow you to       |
  |     charge more for that ride (novelty factor).  I would replace Coasters  |
  |     only if you have already replaced all the rides, and are still short.  |
  |     Then keep on developing the park!  Build scenery, shops, and new       |
  |     rides.  If you want to even stay at the same value, you have to keep   |
  |     adding/replacing rides.                                                |
  |                                                                            |
  |       Tip:  If you desperately need park rating and/or guests, and you     |
  |             don't plan to build any more rides, make the park totally      |
  |             free!  The park rating will boost and the guests will stay     |
  |             forever.  And you'll still be able to hire staff when you have |
  |             negative money. (Ake Malmgren)                                 |

  | Q:  People are avoiding my Rides!                                          |
  |                                                                            |
  | A:  Chances are they think that ride is too expensive.  To find out for    |
  |     sure what is wrong with the ride, check the People tab on the ride and |
  |     click the thought bubble.  You will see exactly what people are        |
  |     thinking.  If you see "I'm not paying that much for XXXX" then slash   |
  |     prices.  Remember that if it's raining, they will tend to avoid        |
  |     outdoor rides like rollercoasters.  The other reason people avoid      |
  |     roller coasters, is if it is too intense (10+).  To tone down the      |
  |     ride, remove sharp turns and replace them with larger, banked turns    |
  |     (not available on all coasters).  You can also add brakes before you   |
  |     hit the sharp turns.                                                   |

  | Q:  People are stuck on my Ride!  How do I get them out?                   |
  |                                                                            |
  | A:  Sometimes the problem is mechanical, and your mechanics will go in and |
  |     get the ride moving again.  However, sometimes, it is simply bad       |
  |     design that gets people "stuck" or "stalled out" on a ride.  In either |
  |     case try to get them out by double clicking the Red "Close" Button on  |
  |     the ride.  If that fixes it then the problem was the design so         |
  |     redesign the ride to remove the problem.  Try to make it go faster     |
  |     through the problem area, add a lift hill or a booster, or even        |
  |     shorten the ride itself.  If closing the ride does nothing, then wait  |
  |     for a mechanic to come and fix the ride.                               |

  |                                                                            |

  |                                                                            |
  | A:   -- from page 40 in the Game Manual                                    |
  |     This is in the manual but some people have troubles with it anyway.    |
  |     First you have to have a ride to save.  Then NAME the ride something   |
  |     (you can't save "Rollercoaster 1").  Finally with the ride window      |
  |     still open, click on the DISK icon and go down to Save Track Design.   |

  | A:  Look above in section "Rides (roller coaster)" for instructions on how |
  |     to build yourself an underground roller coaster.                       |

  | Q:  How do I make a Dueling Coaster using only one coaster?                |
  |                                                                            |

  | Q:  What is a "Peep"?                                                      |
  |                                                                            |
  | A:  A peep is a guest in your park.  I think that this term came from      |
  |     Theme Park, and is meant in a semi-derogatory way.  It certainly       |
  |     sounds mean spirited.  After playing "The Sims" a lot, I tend to call  |
  |     these people "Sims".                                                   |
  '----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
  .----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
  | Q:  How do you make an underground Whoa Belly (like in Mel's World)?       |
  |                                                                            |
  | A:  Well you can't really, but you can make it look like it anyway.  Lower |
  |     a 3x3 section of land at least 2 units (the more you lower it, the     |
  |     harder it will be to build the Whoa Belly--aka Spaceshot or the        |
  |     Reverse Freefall).  Then build the ride in your hole.  Now select the  |
  |     path icon, and select the "Bridge/Tunnel" tool and build a path in a   |
  |     donut shape above the ride.                                            |
  |                                                                            |
  |       Note:  To build a ride entrance underground you must have the land   |
  |              at least 5 units above the bottom of the ride, and the exit   |
  |              needs land 3 units above the bottom of the ride.              |

  | Q:  Help!  My Chairlift won't work!                                        |
  |                                                                            |
  | A:  The chairlift is a little different than other rides, in that you only |
  |     need to make one line (not a loop).  Here's a small diagram of what to |
  |     do.                                                                    |
  |                                                                            |
  |     1st Station                                2nd Station   E - Entrance  |
  |        X  E                                           X  E   X - Exit      |

  |                                                              = - line      |
  |                                                                            |
  |     Where each letter represents 1 square of land.  At the first station   |
  |     you want the Entrance to be close by where the Station touches the     |
  |     wires, but on the 2nd station you want the opposite, put the entrance  |
  |     as far from that as you can, but if possible, still on the same side   |
  |     as the first stations.                                                 |
  '----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
  .----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
  | Q:  Mechanics can't get to my rides to fix them... why not?                |
  |                                                                            |
  | A:  Two possibilities.  One, you gave them an area to patrol that did not  |
  |     include the ride exit (not the path by the exit, the actual exit       |
  |     itself must be covered in their path).  Or Two you are using the Blue  |
  |     Queue Path leading from the exit.  Switch over to a normal type of     |
  |     path and that should fix it.                                           |
  |                                                                            |
  |       Note:  There is no good way to set a route for a mechanic on a       |
  |              completely underground ride.  Sure you can set a route above  |
  |              ground, but no way to keep him underground, he'll tend to     |
  |              stay above ground.                                            |

  | A:   -- from a Grey Box on page 32 of the Manual                           |
  |     This is covered in the manual, but some people seem to have trouble    |
  |     with it anyway.  Open up the Land Window by pressing the Shovel        |
  |     button.  Then press the Minus button.  You should see (in the window)  |
  |     one solid square surrounded by non-solid squares.  Then raise/lower    |
  |     the land as normal and it will raise the land near it as well, but     |
  |     contoured to make a smooth looking hill.                               |

  | Q:  I've been playing this scenario for ages, yet I don't have all the     |
  |     Rides...                                                               |

  | A:  Simply put, not every scenario has every ride.  Most scenarios have    |
  |     all the non-rollercoaster rides, but some (like Forest Frontiers) will |
  |     be missing a few.  Don't worry, you'll get to see those rides soon     |
  |     enough!  You can also check out the section "Scenarios" for a list of  |
  |     Coasters possible in each scenario, sorry there is currently no        |
  |     listing for common rides.                                              |

  |                                                                            |
  | A:  There are a couple of utilities for that!  Go to:                      |
  |                                                                            |
  |     BMP to TP4 - http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Shadowlands/5366/rct.html |
  |     PCX to TP4 - http://members.aol.com/pjc0407/maketp4/index.html         |
  |                                                                            |
  |     These programs are simple to use.  Simply go to your game, take a      |
  |     screenshot of the ride that you want a preview picture of.  Then open  |
  |     the utility and convert it, making sure to name the picture the same   |
  |     as the ride.                                                           |
  |                                                                            |
  |       Note:  If you use the BMP to TP4 program, you will have to convert   |
  |              the PCX screenshot to a BMP in another program before you can |
  |              convert it.                                                   |

  | Q:  How can I create my own Scenarios?                                     |
  |                                                                            |
  | A:  There is a Scenario Editor out now!  Check out the Utilities section   |
  |     for more information.  I've had trouble lately tracking down this      |
  |     editor.  Some days it's there, some days not.  If you are able to find |
  |     it, it only works on Original RCT scenarios.  No one has made anything |
  |     for any of the more recent versions of RCT.                            |
  '----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
  .----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
  | Q:  We installed a new hard drive, and my CD ROM is now a different drive, |
  |     but RCT keeps asking me to put the CD in the drive that the CD ROM     |
  |     used to be...                                                          |
  |                                                                            |
  | A:  You can change this by editing the registry.  Go to:                   |
  |                                                                            |
  |    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Fish Technology Group\Rollercoaster Tycoon\ |
  |     and change the "Setup Path" value from the old drive to the new drive. |

  | Q:  I have version .164 ... where can I get the patch to the latest and    |
  |     greatest version?                                                      |
  |                                                                            |
  | A:  You can find any and all patches on the Official Web Site              |
  |     http://www.rollercoastertycoon.com                                     |
  |                                                                            |
  |     Not only are there updates for the regular game, but for the Add-On as |
  |     well.                                                                  |
  '----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
  .----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
  | Q:  Whenever I attempt to open a saved game, I get an "Invalid Data" error |
  |     when RCT loads.  How can I fix this?                                   |
  |                                                                            |
  | A:  It's usually one of two things.  The first would be the version of RCT |
  |     that you have may not coincide with the version of RCT that the saved  |
  |     game was created in.  If you have Corkscrew Follies/Added Attractions, |
  |     you cannot open a saved game made in Loopy Landscapes.                 |
  |                                                                            |
  |     Another thing that could be the problem is the fact that you don't     |
  |     have the Drexler Patch installed.  Normally, the rct.exe file searches |
  |     the system for cheats or things that aren't normal with the game, and  |
  |     if there is something out of the ordinary, you will possibly get an    |
  |     error message.  With the Drexler Patch installed, that file doesn't do |
  |     the search for those types of things.  To download the Drexler Patch,  |
  |     you can locate it on RCT Station (http://rct.gametropics.com).         |
  '----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
  .----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
  | Q:  Is there going to be a add-on?                                         |
  |                                                                            |
  | A:  There already is an Add-On!  In the USA it is called Corkscrew         |
  |     Follies, and elsewhere it is called Added Attractions.  If you liked   |
  |     RCT, you'll love the Add-On!  As for a sequel... who knows what the    |
  |     future will bring!  Loopy Landscapes, the second Add-On, has been      |
  |     released, so go buy it.                                                |
  '----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
  .----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
  | Q:  Is there going to be a sequel?                                         |
  |                                                                            |
  | A:  Nothing has been officially said in terms of a definite "Yes" or "No"  |
  |     from either Chris Sawyer of Infogrames (purchased Hasbro Interactive). |
  |     I do, however expect to see a sequel to Rollercoaster Tycoon somewhere |
  |     down the road.  Many people have tried to get in on the huge success   |
  |     of RCT, and they haven't done a very good job so far.  Whenever a new  |
  |     coaster game comes out, the big magazine and internet editors who      |
  |     write about PC games, always tend to compare them to RCT.  The truth   |
  |     of the matter is there really is no comparison to make.  The only      |
  |     you could really compare is the graphics.  It's true that RCT doesn't  |
  |     have the latest in 3D graphics, but looks isn't everything.  RCT is    |
  |     so much more vast than any of the recently released coaster games.  If |
  |     someone is going to try and "de-throne" RCT from its reign of being    |
  |     King, they're going to really have to try hard, and get some smart     |
  |     people in there for the development and quality assurance.             |
  '----------------------------------------------------------------------------'
  .----------------------------------------------------------------------------.
  | Q:  What is Chris Sawyer's email address... I have great ideas for an      |
  |     add-on!                                                                |
  |                                                                            |
  | A:  First off, Chris accepts no submissions for new ideas, and won't       |
  |     discuss his future plans.  You can mail Chris at:                      |
  |        webmaster@chrissawyer.com                                           |
  |     However, I hear that he has since moved on from this email address.    |

  If you still haven't read the manual, SERIOUSLY, go read it!  Or at the very
  least go skim through it and look at the pictures!  I have kept this FAQ
  "lite" in that it doesn't contain any information on installing, running, or
  maintaining the game itself, and mostly has information on how to play the
  game.  This faq was intended as a guide for beginners to intermediate range,
  and also as a reference for the more "serious" player.

__________
Wish List: (things that I wish were in the game... don't get me wrong, it is
ØØØØØØØØØØ  a great game, but I think a few things here and there could make it
            a PERFECT game!  Also this Wish List is PRE-Add-On, some of the
            things have since been added to the game!)
  Separate Roller Coaster Designer -- so you don't pay for it as you build
  Scenario Editor -- so that we can create our own scenarios, edit the map, etc.
  Ride Creator/Editor -- If you ever saw the SimCity Urban Renewal Kit, you
       know what I'm talking about.  It was a really neat utility that you could
       use to edit/create new buildings with.  An RCT version would let you
       create new rides/shops/etc.
  More interesting Vandalism -- maybe they could spraypaint your rides, or even
       damage the ride itself (throw a wrench on the track of a coaster or
       something)
  More types of Entertainers -- a calypso band or a Magician.  The Add-Ons add
       new entertainers like the Roman, the Snowman, the Knight, and the
       Astronaut.
  An arcade attraction -- get more money, another place to go in the rain
  The SkyCoaster -- where they pull you up 200 feet and drop you, then you
       swing at high speeds, it's kinda like skydiving.
  More Musical Rides -- like the Merry-Go-Round, or Bumper Cars, OR the ability
       to put music "boxes" in the park to add music without a ride.  This is
       definitely done in the Add-On as you can add music to almost any ride!
  Different Game Speeds (slow would be nice to edit rides, fast to get through
       scenarios quickly)
  Dynamic Queues -- they would increase or decrease in size depending on the
       need of the ride.  New rides would have longer queues, and as the ride
       aged its queue could shrink as its crowd shrinks.
  Other Types of Restaurants/Shops
       Sit Down Restaurant -- would be pricey to bring in the big bucks
       Cafeteria -- Cheap but could hold a lot of people, maybe it could be like
         the bumper cars (size wise).
       Bar/Club -- for the Adults
       T-shirt Shop -- "I survived the ANNIHILATOR!" or whatever.  The Add-On
       adds a T-Shirt shop.
       Large Shops -- like the Emporium in Disneyland which sells almost
         everything found in the park
       There are lots of new shops/restaurants in the Add-On, such as Hot Dogs,
       and the Hat Shop.
  Multiple Parks on your property each with a separate Admission, like Disney
       World, or Universal Escape
  "Non-Thrill"/Educational Rides -- like almost anything in EPCOT
  Live Shows/Features
       Fireworks
       Parades
       Large Fountain Shows
  Competing Parks -- whether versus another player or the computer this would
       be very fun.  This also brings up the point of Multiplayer features which
       could be added.  Imagine competing against a friend to build the biggest
       bested park.  He builds a colossal coaster so YOU build an even larger
       one!
  MEGA Rides -- larger versions of current rides, like a GIANT Ferris wheel
  Shows -- like Sea World's Shamu, or Disney World's Indiana Jones Stunt thing
       (or if you played Theme Park, think the various "Acts" attractions like
       the "Clown Acts" or the "Medieval Acts")
       There is a Circus Tent Show in the Add-On.
  Themed Areas -- guests could go to a themed area (like a "land") instead of
       to a specific ride, based on their ride preference.  For example you
       could have a "Kiddie Land" with all gentle rides, and a "Monster Land"
       with really big Coasters.
       The signs in the Add-On work just like themed areas.
  Night Time -- your park would close and everyone would leave giving you a
       chance to clean up, and maintain the park.
  Winter -- you could either close up shop for the season-- but still invest in
       new rides-- or you could stay open, weather permitting
  Different Types of Guests for your park (Old People, Babies, Families)
       The Muffinator had this to say:
         "In Busch Gardens, there are just as many people going there for the
         park as there are for the rides. There are heavily themed areas, with
         wonderful shops, theaters, gardens, and other crap that old people
         like. That might be nice for RCT... old people! I bet they would like
         Evergreen Gardens."
  Ake Malmgren had these wishes:
    A way to buy multiple squares of land/construction rights at once,
    and maybe an ability to sell land.

    A customizable version of the Haunted House (maybe a Haunted Railroad or
    something) with lots of special track pieces and scenery to scare the guests
    with.

    An ability to start building at a particular height level, e.g. start
    underground without having to lower land.

    Waterfalls.

      illegal activity related to the game, in that not only do I know nothing
