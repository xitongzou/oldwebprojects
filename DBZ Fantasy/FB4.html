<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 1: Son Goku Finally 
Comes and Beats Up Nappa </font> </span></u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Gohan and Krillin are the only ones left. Piccolo, Yamcha, Tenshinhan, and 
Chaozu are dead. Nappa still will not give up to defeat them. Just when all 
seems lost, Goku comes in. Nappa asks who he is, and, just checks every person 
to see who is dead or unconscious. After an investigation, Goku then starts to 
power up, and, finally goes against Nappa, impressing everyone about his power, 
except Nappa. Nappa is getting seriously beat up and pissed off. After a long 
fight, Vegeta tells Nappa to give up. Nappa agrees, saying he will come down. 
Goku just stays up in the air, hoping Nappa will not come back. Nappa gets an 
idea to go after Krillin and Gohan on the ground. After going full speed, Goku 
has to chase after him. Knowing Goku won't make it; he uses the Kaiouken on 
Nappa for the first time. </font> </span></p>

<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 2: Vegeta Gets Rid of 
His Partner, Nappa</font></span></u><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
After using the Kaiouken, Nappa is totally paralyzed. Goku throws him over to 
Vegeta, telling him to go back home. Vegeta doesn't answer; he just looks at 
Nappa. Nappa begs for him to forgive him and to let him up. Vegeta gives him a 
hand, to die. He throws Nappa into the air, and begins to power up. Nappa knows 
he will die now, and, calls Vegeta every bad name in the book. Vegeta just tells 
him he is worthless now. Vegeta lets loose his ki and fries Nappa into nothing.

<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 3: Two Saiyans Fight to 
the Death</font></span></u><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Vegeta's Power is Always Rising Goku leads Vegeta into a barren wasteland, to 
fight him. After finally finding the right spot, Goku begins his attack. Vegeta 
wants him to do the attack he did to Nappa, so Goku does it. After doing the 
Kaiouken on Vegeta, it has no effect. Goku then decides he has to go Kaiouken 
x2. Vegeta gets a hit allot, and, starts to power up to a very high level of 
power. Goku then gets very excited about what is about to become of this fight.

<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 4: Son Goku Powers Up 
to Kaiouken x4 </font> </span></u><span style="font-family: Arial">
<font size="2">
<br>
Goku then disobeys Kaio Sama, and goes to Kaiouken x3, which is just enough to 
beat up Vegeta very much. After not being able to handle it anymore, Vegeta 
decides he doesn't need to Dragon Balls here and can go to Namek. He wants to 
blow up the planet. After gathering the necessary ki, Vegeta lets loose his most 
powerful attack, as does Goku, while in Kaiouken x3. It is a tug o war after 
that, and, neither side is winning. Vegeta puts more power into his blast, and 
Goku decides to go Kaiouken x4, even though he knows he will probably blow up. 
He does so anyway, lives through it, and blasts Vegeta into the sky. Vegeta, now 
caught in Goku's Kamehameha, is very much upset. </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 5: Vegeta Finally 
Transform into Oozaru; but will He Win!? </font> </span></u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Vegeta, after escaping the blast, looks for the moon, to transform. He finds it 
is gone, and will have to use some of his own energy to make an artificial moon. 
After doing so, he goes into his Oozaru form, and, begins to trample Goku. After 
Goku cannot bear it anymore, he begins to just give up. He lets Vegeta does as 
he wishes. But, Krillin, Gohan, and Yajirobe are going back to the fight scene, 
to try and help. Krillin makes an attempt to try and cut Vegeta's tail off, but 
it doesn't work. Vegeta tells them to just sit back and watch Goku die. </font> </span>

<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 6: Everyone Has to Team 
Up to Beat Vegeta </font> </span></u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Yajirobe finally decides to play hero, and, cuts off Vegeta's tail. Realizing 
the state he is in now, Vegeta goes back to his Saiyan form. This makes Vegeta 
terribly angry. He cannot bear to stand these Earthlings now. He wants to kill 
them all, but is low on energy. He goes for Gohan first, and, nearly kills him. 
Krillin steps in, and, just as usual, one hit to the head, and he is down for 
the count. Gohan steps back up, and, cannot bear it anymore. However, Vegeta 
beats him up, yet again. Gohan, still on the ground, cannot move. Vegeta comes 
back to kill him, when Gohan's tail comes out. Yajirobe decides to play hero 
once more, and, cuts through Vegeta's armor, causing a major back pain for 
Vegeta. Yajirobe declares himself the winner, until Vegeta gets up, and kicks 
the crap out of him. Krillin comes over to Goku, seeing if he can help. </font> </span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 7: Save the World and 
Throw the Genki Dama </font> </span></u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Goku gives Krillin the Genki Dama that he tried to build up, but didn't make it. 
Krillin cannot believe how much power he was holding in his hand, and, was told 
by Kaio Sama to throw it at the moment he felt it was right, not at the moment 
that it seemed perfect. After following his orders, Krillin finally knew it was 
time to throw it. Vegeta saw the energy coming to him, and dodged it. Gohan was 
in its path now. Goku told him to bounce it back, so it would not hurt him. 
Gohan does so, and, it goes straight for an unsuspecting Vegeta. Vegeta then is 
blasted into the air, leaving nothing but screaming behind him. </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 8: At Last! Vegeta is 
Retreating </font> </span></u><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
The trio begins to celebrate, until Vegeta comes back down. Everyone panics as 
they see him get back on his feet. Vegeta then uses the last of his energy to 
blow up everything around him. Everyone is knocked out, or crippled. Vegeta then 
walks over to Gohan, starting the final blow, until Vegeta sees Gohan's tail 
come out. Vegeta cannot believe it, and, begins to try and stop it, but, is too 
late. Gohan transforms and starts his rampage on Vegeta. Vegeta can only run, 
until, he finds an opening to cut Gohan's tail off. After successfully doing so, 
Gohan de-transforms, but, right on top of Vegeta. Vegeta is then crushed on the 
ground, almost paralyzed. He then tries to make his way to his ship, when, 
Krillin stops him, with Yajirboes's sword, demanding that he doesn't move. Goku 
asks him to let him go, so he can fight him again another time. Krillin obeys 
and Vegeta tells him he will live to regret it, as his planet will not be spared 
with him comes back to destroy it.</font></span>
