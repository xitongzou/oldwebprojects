<EM>Author's Notes</EM>

<P>This story takes place somewhere between the Garlic Jr. Saga and the Android Saga. 
This story is about Gohan. Please note that Goku is not back on Earth yet.

<P>This is my first fanfic, so please go easy on me. This story isn't going to be as 
good as The Kakkarot Saga, or Centa's journey, but I still think most people will enjoy this.
If you think that in the second chapter I should include something, please e-mail
me. If you would like to make an alternate ending for this, be my guest.

<P>But anyway, I've bored you enough, so I'll start my story now.

<P>I call this, "Yungzabitz Heights". Enjoy!

Chapter 1</H3>

 <P>Once upon a time, there was a child named Gohan. Gohan was different from 
 everybody else, because He was very powerful. Gohan's father, Goku, was off on 
 another planet somewhere.

 <P>Gohan's Mom, Chi-Chi, wanted Gohan to be a scholar. She was very hard on him, 
 and didn't want him to train.

 <P>One day, Gohan was doing his homework. He looked up in the sky and thought to 
 himself, "I wish Dad were here." He sighed, and continued on his school work. 
 He heard a strange noise outside, but he really didn't think it was anything 
 because he had a noisy pet dragon, "Icarus" always making noise.

 <P>He hopped off his desk chair and went downstairs. He thought to himself, "I 
 wanna snack." When he got downstairs his Mom scolded him. "Gohan! What are you 
 doing down here? You're supposed to be upstairs. Go back up stairs this instant." 
 Chi-Chi yelled. "But Mom....."
 
<P>"No buts. Move it mister. NOW!" 

 <P>Gohan hung his head and walked back upstairs. He heard the noise again, but this 
 time it was different. It was a creepy noise. He still didn't think it was anything 
 to worry about, so he continued on his school work. 

<P>After a few minutes, he heard the noise again. This time louder, and creepier. He 
finally sighed, and got off his chair. "Icarus.....shut up you stupid dragon!" He 
looked around and Icarus was nowhere in sight.

<P>"Stupid dragon." Gohan said to himself. He continued on his math problems, and 
something bothered him. He started sweating. He suddenly started panting, and he 
broke his pencil. 

 <P>Now he was sweating more than ever, and he started gasping for air. He fell off 
 the chair, and choking. He was making a lot of noise, and Chi-Chi heard him downstairs.

 <P>"What on earth could that child be doing now?" She thougt. "He better not have that 
 monster of a pet in the house." "I better go upstairs and tell him to keep the racket 
 down."

 <P>She walked upstairs, then to Gohan's bedroom. She knocked on the door. "Gohan, what 
 are you doing in there?"

 <P>No answer.

 <P>"Gohan?"

 <P>No answer.

 <P>She twisted the door knob and opened the door. "Gohan what are you do- 
 ...........AAAAAAHHHH!!!!" 

 <P>There in Gohan's bedroom floor was Icarus, dead, and slaughtered.

  <P>Chi-Chi ran down stairs and looked around the house. She looked into the backyard.

 <P>No Gohan.

 <P>She looked into the nearby forest.

 <P>No Gohan.

 <P>But when she looked into the forest she saw a fresh path.

 <P>She put on her shoes and followed the path. 30 minutes later, she came to an open 
 clearing. She scanned the meadow, and there was still no sign of Gohan.

 <P>She looked farther into the trees, and she saw a green figure.

 <P>She thought at first it might be Piccolo. She gazed even harder and she saw that 
 green figure carrying a huge Kane.

 <P>"That must be Kami!" She thought. 

  <P>She ran towards Kami, and half way there, she started to feel dizzy. Very dizzy.

  <P>Chi-Chi tried to stay up. But she couldn't.

  <P>She knew something, or somebody was trying to keep her away from Kami.

  <P>Chi-Chi collapsed to the ground, and with her last moments of consciousness, she saw 
  Kami, protecter of the earth, and Gohan, her only son, flying away.

 <P>"I don't think it was really nessessary to do that to Mom." Gohan said. "And where's 
 Icarus?" 

 <P>"Gohan, Icarus is dead." Kami replied. "There is a monster, from a place that I grew 
 up in. It is called, "Yungzabitz Heights." "It is on the edge of earth, and is very 
 cold and windy. The monster from there, called "Kenzan", by many, feeds on ki."

  <P>"You are now the most powerful being on the planet, Gohan. Vegita was, Kenzan sensed 
  him first. Vegita was easily killed. There is nothing you can do to stop it, it lives 
  forever."

  <P>"It chokes you to death, then it feeds on your ki. I sensed it moving toward you, and 
  I got there as quick as I could. I pulled you out of there, and the closest thing with 
  ki that it could feed on was your pet, Icarus."

  <P>"YOU MEAN THAT WE LEFT ME MOM WITH SOMETHING THAT KILLED VEGITA!? ARE YOU NUTS! TURN 
  AROUND!"

  <P>"Relax, Gohan. Kenzan can't sense someone's ki if their unconscious. Chi-Chi will 
  remain unconscious until I will wake her up. I didn't want to do that, I would have 
  taken her, too. It would have taken more explaining, and more time. We didn't have 
  that much time."

  <P>"Oh. I see. But where are we going?" Gohan asked.

  <P>"We are going to Yungzabitz Heights. The only way to destroy Kenzan is to keep it from 
  getting ki. Once it starves from ki, it is no longer immortal. Then you and the rest 
  of the Z team will fight it. But for now we must wait, and pray that the others will 
  make it here in time."

<EM>Author's Notes</EM>

<P>Well I figured it was about time to write the second part to my story(although, 
there will be more than 2 chapters). 

<P>I thought I would see the story from the Z fighter who would fight Kenzan. 
Although none of the fighters will fight him this time, I will see it through the 
eyes of Gohan, since he's the main character anyway. 

<P>Well enough about that, here is chapter 2.......

Chapter 2</H3>


<P>"Kami, I have a a few questions." I said. 

<P>"Yes, I thought you would Gohan."

<P>"Well number 1, you said that I was the strongest on Earth. I thought since Dad isn't here and Vegeta is dead, shouldn't Piccolo be the strongest?"

<P>"Good question. Piccolo is the strongest indeed. But you have an incredible hidden power in you that Guru didn't unlock. Enough power to become a Super Saiyan."

<P>"But why didn't Guru unlock all of my power? Wouldn't that have helped us against Freeza?"

<P>"That is a question I do not have the answer to. It is strange, I know, but maybe Guru did it for a reason. Now what was you other question?

<P>"Yes. Why are we going to Yungzabitz Heights? Shouldn't we be going to your lookout?"

<P>"That I cannot tell you. For right now at least."

<P>"Okay. So how are we to beat this, "Kenzan"?

<P>"He is fully charged right now. After a month or so, He will start to get weaker and try to absorb anything that has a ki level of over 200. That is all I can tell you for right now. We have to wait for Krillen, Yamcha, Tien, Chaoutzu, and Piccolo to arrive. Wait there is something I forgot to tell you. Kenzan in his ki-absorbing form has no mind of it's own. It is sort of like an animal. Once it weakens his outer shell will come off and his brain will be activated. You and the others will then fight him like you would fight any other warrior."

<P>"But how could he possibly fight, since he would have no ki? I asked.

<P>"Undeneath his shell he has a power even greater than Freeza's"

<P>Me and Kami waited for the others to arrive one by one, and Kami told them the same story as he told me, and they all pretty much asked them the same questions as I did.

<P>The next day I went to get my mom, and we brought her to Roshi's(Kenzan won't go there, he can't swim, or so Kami said.)

<P>Kami kept a lot of things unexplained. It seemed to me like he was afraid to even talk about it. I decided it was best not to question Kami.

<P>Me and Piccolo went off to train for that month that while we waited for Kenzan to drain. That was actually pretty easy. In that form Kenzan moved very slowly, and because it had a ki as high as Vegeta's we could all sense it coming within a 1,000 miles.

<P>When it was time to quit training, We all returned to Yungzabitz Heights. We waited for an hour for Kenzan to get there, and he seemed to be going very slowly, since he was kinda runnin on empty.

<P>Yajirobe came to drop off the senzu beans, then jumped back into his air car figuring he was going to get the heck out of there.

<P>We waited impatiently, and were ready to just fo and find him and get this over with.

<P>Just then, far off in the horizon, we could see kenzan flying slowly towards us.

<P>Kenzan sure was a weird looking creature. I felt a cold shiver come up my spine. I don't think I could describe him. I guess he looked kinda like Guldo from the Ginyu Force. 

<P>"Look at him" Yamchu shouted. "What a shrimp! IS THIS A JOKE!!!!???"

<P>"QUIET YOU IDIOT!!!!" yelled Mr. Piccolo

<P>Yamcha shut up then. I guess he didn't want to mess with Mr. Piccolo(WHO WOULD?)

<P>I tried to concentrate on his ki. Very low. It was about the power that of Radditz's.

<P>The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. The wind was blowing, but it started to gust. Some nearby debri flew around, getting into my eyes.

<P>I squinted. I held my hands infront of my eyes as a shield. 

<P>The wind started to pick up even more. I started to fall back, losing my balance. I landed straight on my rear.

<P>"Oof!" I said

<P>"Get up Gohan. Concentrate and study his power." said Krillen

<P>I got back up, and I saw that Kenzan was starting to shake. His "shell" was starting to crack, and I saw beams of light coming from within. He started making these weird grunting noises. 

<P>The wind picked up even more. I felt it harder to stand up staight. I saw him spread out his arms and he let out this long, loud yell, sort of like Vegeta when he's powering up. His shell started to crack even more, and mountains started exploding!

<P>I heard one of us yell, "Let's get the Hell out of here, he's about to blow his shell!"

<P>I guess things were pretty frantic at that moment, because we all high tailed it out of there!

<P>We landed about a mile away, and back were we were we saw a huge explosion, enough to shake the planet, and it did too.

<P>We flew back, and Kenzan looked like a whole different creature. Imagine Freeza with Green, Scaly skin. That's as best as I could put it. His ki was enormous. Far greater than that of Freeza's.

<P>(change of scenery)

<P>"Oh, No!" I yelled.

<P>"King Kai, what's wrong?" yelled Gregory.

<P>"It seems that a new creature, the evil Kenzan has returned. With a much greater ki. He is probably 10 times the power of Freeza!"

<P>"Boogaboogabooga!" yelled bubbles.

<P>"Shut up Bubbles! This is no time to be goofing off!"

<P>"Do the earthlings stand a chance King Kai?" asked Gregory.

<P>"No. even with Goku they have no chance at all"

<P>(back to earth)

<P>"Well, it seems that you 6 warriors want a fight." Kenzan said.

<P>None of us said anything. We were to scared to speak. Even Mr. Piccolo. I saw him clenching his fist and gringing his teeth, but I knew he was scared.

<P>"Very Well. If none of you want to attack me, then I will decide for you who get's to die first!" Kenzan said.

<P>He spoke with a funny accent, sounded kinda British to me.

<P>Some Green energy waves appeared around him. Then he shot a green beam at us.

<P>The waves wrapped around us, and I felt like I was parayled from the neck down. I guess it happened to all of us, because none of use were moving.

<P>He stuck out his hand, then closed it. He opened it again, and there was our bag of senzu beans.

<P>I could still talk but I didn't say anything. I knew it would do no good. I didn't like the predicament we were in.

<P>I couldn't turn my head to I used my peripheral vision to scan to see what everyone was doing. I looked at Krillen, and I saw that he was free.

<P>Kenzan shot him with another green beam, and teleported him to where Kenzan was standing.

<P>"Now watch your friend die." Kenzan said with a smile

<P>"Krillen," I whispered over and over again in my mind. I couldn't see the future, but something kept playing in my head. The vision of Kenzan killing him.

<P>I looked at Krillen with sorrow, knowing I was going to lose one of my best friends. And there was nothing I could do about it. Nothing.

<h3 align=center>To be continued........</H3>

<P>Keep an eye out for part 3, "Krillen's demise"</P>
