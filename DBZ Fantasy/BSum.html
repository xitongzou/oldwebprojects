<FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#FFFFFF" FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven years passed since the Cell Game. Much has changed during this era of peace. Gohan is a student of Orange Star High School, and became the boyfriend of Videl (Beederu), Satan's daughter. Trunks is now eight years old. His best friend is Goten, Gohan's little brother who is one year younger than Trunks. Krillin married Android #18 and became the father of Marron. Vegeta settled down after Goku's death. The peace will now last long... Goku is competing in a fighting tournament of the dead. His meets a stalemate with his new friend and opponent, Paiku-han. The tournament is to decide whom the Master of all Kaious will train. Goku loses on a technicality (Goku feet touches the edge of the heavens before Paiku-hans does), but the Master Kaiou trains Goku anyway (he feels that Goku has a good heart and is worthy of training). On Earth, Gohan is training Goten and Vegeta is training Trunks. Throughout all this Gohan dresses up and becomes Saiyan-man (the Dragonball version of superman). This is how he meets Beederu (Videl). Gohan and Vegeta become shocked at the fact that Goten and Trunks can reach Super Saiyan stage at such young ages. There is another Tenkaichi Budoukai on Earth. Goten and Trunks want to attend in the competition, but are banned because they are too young. However, they steal a competitor's costume and wear it. They battle Android 18 and their disguise is revealed. Piccolo faces someone known as Kaiou-shin, but freezes upon sensing his opponent's power. Goku is granted a single day of life to fight at the tournament so he is also present. It is Gohan's turn to compete. He has assumed the identity as the Saiyan-man. Videl is in the tournament and faces of against Supopobiitchi, who toys with her at first but then begins to beat her up to almost death. Just before Supopobiitchi stomps on her, Gohan, who has feelings for her, becomes enraged and powers up turning Super Saiyan. This blows off his disguise and the audience learns that the Great Saiyan-Man is really the nerd Gohan. Supopobiitchi and Yamu, two competitors with a &quot;M&quot; on their foreheads, fly out to the battle ring and approach Gohan. Then, the two mysterious men take out a lamp and use it to absorb Gohan's energy. Gohan falls unconscious, Supopobitchi and Yamu fly away and everyone else become shocked and wonder what just happened. Kaiou-shin and his partner approach the Z warriors and revive Gohan. Then, they tell their story. They are really godly beings beyond Kaiou and are here to stop the plot of Babi-di and Darbura. Babi-di is an ugly little being who wants to destroy all life just for the fun of it. Darbura is the Prince of Darkness. Babi-di and Darbura are allied at the task of reviving someone called BUU. To do so, a lot of energy is needed. Everyone learns that Supopobitchi and Yamu are zombies of Babi-di. That is why they absorbed Gohan's energy. Allowing Sopopobitchi and Yamu to attack Gohan was part of the plan to follow them to Babi-di's lair. A new terror breaches over the Earth. The Z warriors decide to help Kaiou-shin for the sake of their planet, and follow Supopobitchi and Yamu to Babi-di and Darbura's lair. Vegeta is enraged with Goku for leaving the tournament (Vegeta wants to beat Goku once and for all). Babi-di and Darbura's minions are killed in the battles to come. Our heroes face Darbura now. Unaware of Darbura's ability to &quot;stone&quot;, Krillin and Piccolo are turned into stone. The only remedy to the curse would be Darbura's death. Darbura is eventually killed and Krillin and Piccolo are restored to normal. Learning that becoming Babi-di's slave will make him stronger, Vegeta volunteers to become Babi-di's slave. A &quot;M&quot; appears on Vegeta's forehead and he turns evil once again. Majin-Vegeta looks forward for another battle against Goku and hopes to defeat him once and for all. Vegeta's power donation to Babi-di grants enough energy to revive the fat being known as Buu or FAT-BUU. Buu is reawakened and Babi-di rides around the city on top of him. Cities begin to get terrorized. Majin-Vegeta battles with Goku and knocks him out, but realizes that good triumphs over evil. He regains his sanity and truly becomes good. Majin-Vegeta goes off for Buu and fights him. Buu is a lot stronger and has the advantage. In a final effort to defeat Buu, Vegeta self-destructs, hoping that his sacrifice will take Buu down with him. To his dismay, Buu survives. Even in Super Saiyan level 2, Goku is unable to defeat Buu. Rage increases, the Earth shakes and new lighting surrounds Goku and it happens, Goku reaches Super Saiyan level 3 for the first time! Meanwhile, Bulma gathers the Dragonballs to revive all the civilians killed by the Majins since the Tenkaichi Budoukai. Buu grows tired of being Babi-di's slave and kills him. He then makes friends with Mr. Satan and his puppy. Buu likes the puppy. The puppy gets hurt and Buu creates a little Buu to kill the person who hurts the puppy. One is pure good (Fat-Buu), and the other is pure evil (little-Buu). The two Buu's fight and the evil one turns the good Buu into a cookie. The cookie is eaten, and Boo powers up in a body transformation. The fat Buu is now leaner and more muscular and is now called Ultimate-Buu. Meanwhile, Gohan heads to Kaiou-shin's planet to receive training. As a sign of respect, he wears the Kaiou-shin suit. Gohan pulls out the legendary Z Sword and begins to train under Dai Kaiou-shin, the Elder Kaiou-shin. Gohan is learning how to use his hidden powers without getting angry to go Super Saiyan mode. Kaiou-shin reflects at his past. When he was young, he lived in peace with his family at his home planet. Then, an evil sorcerer, Babi-di's ancestor, used Buu to terrorize. (At the time, Buu was smaller than how he appears during the current section of the series.) Buu killed all of Kaiou-shin's family members. One of the Kaiou-shins merged into Buu to try and use his good ki to control Buu, this is how Buu was turned into his fat form and it also gave the Kaiou-shin the chance to make him dormant. Kaiou-shin, his bodyguard Kibits, and Dai Kaiou-shin are the only Kaiou-shins left. Now, years later, Buu has been revived. Everyone is at Sky Palace (Dende and PoPo's palace) except Gohan, who is still training under the Kaiou-shins. Goku taught Goten and Trunks the art of fusion. Goten and Trunks fuse and become Gotenks! Then, he teleports to Kaiou-shin's planet and watches everything through Kaiou-shin's crystal ball. Ultimate-Buu heads for Sky Palace to look for the &quot;strong&quot; being he sensed. He needs to absorb more powerful beings to be restored to his original form; the stronger form that he was in before the dying Kaiou-shins cursed him. The &quot;strong&quot; being in which Ultimate-Buu searches for is Gotenks. Goten and Trunks are training in a room called the spirit and time room inside Sky Palace. Piccolo tricks Ultimate-Buu into waiting for the boys to come out. Time passes by slower in the room, so it will buy some time for the boys to train more. Chi-Chi, seeing Ultimate-Buu, goes up to him to scold him for killing so many innocent people. Ultimate-Buu turns Chi-Chi into an egg and squashes it. Ultimate-Buu grows tired of waiting and threatens to be taken into the room in which Goten and Trunks are in, or else he will kill everyone at Sky Palace. Piccolo, knowing that he is too weak to fight Ultimate-Buu, takes Ultimate-Buu to Goten and Trunks with the hope that the boys have become strong enough to fight Ultimate-Buu. Goten and Trunks fuse into Gotenks and fight Ultimate-Buu. Gotenks is able to stand up to Ultimate-Buu, but neither side is winning. Piccolo blasts the doorway in the room. Then, he tells that without the exit, everyone will remain trapped in it forever so Ultimate-Buu can no longer kill any more people. Gotenks argues with Piccolo that they too have become trapped. Ultimate-Buu creates a fireball that produces a portal exit. He exits the room and returns Sky Palace. Gotenks and Piccolo look at each other in grief; they are not trapped and Ultimate-Buu is free. Super Saiyan Gotenks tries to create the same fireball that Boo created, but is too weak to. He powers up and reaches Super Saiyan level 3. Now much stronger, he is able to produce the portal. Piccolo and Gotenks exit the room and face Ultimate-Buu once again. In the battle followed, Sky Palace is destroyed. Super Saiyan level 3 Gotenks is overwhelming Ultimate-Buu and winning. Ultimate-Buu is thrown back to Earth. Gotenks and Piccolo return to Earth to search for Ultimate-Buu 's body. Ultimate-Buu survived the attack and reappears. Gotenks prepares to fight again, but the fusion wears off. Goten and Trunks unfused are too weak to fight Ultimate-Buu. Gohan completes his training with Dai Kaiou-shin. He chooses a change in clothes to wearing his father's suit and wishes everyone goodbye. Goku wishes his son luck, but envies that he cannot help because he is dead. Kaiou-shin's partner teleports Gohan to Earth. Gohan appears in time to save Goten, Trunks, and Piccolo. Gohan beats Ultimate-Buu and Ultimate-Buu self-destructs. Thinking they won the battle, Gohan, Goten, Piccolo and Trunks fly off. They see Satan and Dende on their journey and take them with them. A being flies towards them. It is Ultimate-Buu! Goten and Trunks fuse again and are in Super Saiyan level 3. Eagerly wanting to fight again, Gotenks boasts about beating Ultimate-Buu. Taking advantage of the distraction, Ultimate-Buu absorbs Super Saiyan level 3 Gotenks (for the power) and Ultimate-Buu undergoes another body change. Now a lot stronger, Ultimate-Buu overwhelms Gohan. Ultimate-Buu throws a fireball at Gohan. Gohan tries to block, but another fireball pushes Ultimate-Buu 's fireball away from Gohan. The ally is Tenshi-han. However, Ultimate-Buu prepares another fireball In the judgment court, King Yama grants Vegeta life so that he could help save the planet. Goku has an idea, he wants to perform Fusion with Gohan but has 2 problems 1-they would not have enough time to do the fusion techniques and 2-Goku is still dead. In Kaiou-shin's planet, the Kaiou-shins tell Goku about fusion earrings. Kaiou-shin and his bodyguard known as Kibits demonstrate. Each partner wears one of the earrings on opposite ears and the two permanently fuses to form Kaiou-shin and Kibits formed what is later known as Kaiobit. The earrings are given to Goku. He is to give one to Gohan so that he and Gohan could fuse to beat Ultimate-Buu. To bring Goku back to life, Dai Kaiou-shin exchanges his life for Goku. Goku&#146;s halo disappears, and Dai Kaiou-shin falls dead. Then, he reawakens with a halo on top of his head. Goku thanks everyone and teleports to help save Earth. Ultimate-Buu is about to throw a huge fireball at Gohan. Goku teleports to the scene and throws a fireball at Ultimate-Buu. Ultimate-Buu is sliced and his legs and lower part of his antennae are cut off. Goku tells Gohan about the fusion earrings and throws one to Gohan. Gohan catches it and prepares to wear it. The cut off part of Ultimate-Buu 's antennae engulfs Piccolo (for his strategic attacks) and Ultimate-Buu changes into a stronger form again. The cut off lower body of Ultimate-Buu walks and kicks Tenshi-han unconscious. Then, it engulfs Gohan (for more power) and Ultimate-Buu powers up again. Goku feels despair again. Vegeta appears and aids Goku. Goku tells Vegeta about the fusion earrings and Vegeta finds the earring dropped by Gohan when Gohan got absorbed. Vegeta at first refuses not liking the Idea of being fused with Goku FOREVER. Vegeta finally agrees, Goku and Vegeta are pulled together and become VEGETTO! Vegetto beats Ultimate-Buu, but purposely gets absorbed by Ultimate-Buu to save their comrades. The absorption canceled out the effect of the permanent fusion and Vegetto splits back into Goku and Vegeta. They find and rescue Goten, Trunks, Gohan, and Piccolo by carrying the bodies and escaping through one of Ultimate-Buu 's pores. Good Buu is also still in Ultimate-Buu 's body. As the characters left Ultimate-Buu 's pores, they returned to their original size. Now that Fat-Buu (good-Buu) is no longer attached to Ultimate-Buu&#146;s membrane sack, but is still inside of the Ultimate-Buu. The real Buu is revealed this Buu is called Majin-Buu (evil-Buu). Majin-Buu does a giant fireball and blows up the Earth. The newly fused Kaiobit teleports to help Goku teleport Vegeta, Trunks, Goten, Gohan, Piccolo, Dende, and Satan to safety in Kaiou-shin's planet. But Goku can only save Vegeta, Dende and Mr. Satan. Majin-Buu teleports and follows Goku. Goku and Majin-Buu battle. Goku gets beaten and is weak, so Vegeta joins the fight. Vegeta, finally seeing Goku in his SSJ3 form, admits that Goku is better than him for the first time and realizes why Goku will always be more powerful than he can because Goku's power comes from fighting for the people he loves. Vegeta then thinks of his family and attacks Majin-Buu to try and give Goku time to power-up to SSJ3 again. Majin-Buu beats Vegeta and is about to kill him, but Satan pops up and threatens Majin-Buu. Majin-Buu attacks Satan but Satan dodges the punch. All of a sudden, Majin-Buu goes in pain and spits the good fat-Buu out. The two Buu's fight and Fat-Buu gets beat unconscious. Goku and Vegeta continue to face Majin-Buu. Vegeta tells Dende to gather the Namek Dragonballs. He does so, and makes the first wish to restore the Earth. The second wish revives all the civilians that Buu killed. The third wish is saved for later. Everyone is back on Earth except Goku, Vegeta, and Majin-Buu. Goku begins to create a spirit-bomb while Vegeta distracts Majin-Buu. Our heroes on Earth tell people to raise their hands. Doing so will donate energy to Goku's fireball. However, no one listens. Vegeta tries, but really doesn't know how to be polite. Finally Satan, still famous after the Cell Game, tells the people of earth (with the help of King-Kai) to raise their hands. Recognizing the voice of their idol, everyone on Earth raises their hands. Goku gets enough energy for his fireball and he fires it. Majin-Buu is too strong to get blasted and holds the fireball back. Dende makes the last wish from the Dragonballs to restore Goku's energy. Goku's power restores from his weakened state and he uses his revived strength to strengthen his fireball. Before killing Majin-Buu, Goku, loving the challenge Buu gave him, wished for Buu to be reincarnated as a Boy. After that Goku powers-up and kills Majin-Buu. . Our heroes&#146; debate on whether or not to kill Fat-Buu, Vegeta wants Buu killed, but Satan pleads that this Buu saved his life and Goku agrees with Satan. The Z warriors use a wish to make the people of earth forget about the Buu's and the Fat-Buu joins the Z warriors. 10yrs pass and Goten and Trunks are teenagers. Gohan married Videl (Beederu), and the two became parents of five-year old Pan. Remember Goku's&#146; wish, well his wish was granted and at the last Budokai a boy named Uubu (Buu spelled backwards) was in the Budokai to try and win money for his mother and father....Goku, sensing it was Buu reincarnated with all evil cleansed, had the Fat-Buu fix the fight so Goku would square off with Uubu, Goku needed to be sure it was the right boy, turns out it was, Goku had to go SSJ2 to hurt Uubu, so Goku stopped fighting and told Uubu he can make him a great fighter, Uubu agreed and the last seen is of Uubu riding on Goku's back Flying to a remote Island to train; There is peace on Earth. Now begins the GT series....</FONT></div>
