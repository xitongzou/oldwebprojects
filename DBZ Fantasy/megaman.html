===============================================================================


-[1.01]-----------------------WHAT IS MEGAMAN X?-------------------------------

 MEGAMAN X (CAPCOM 1993) was the first 16bit game to feature the ever popular
 Blue Bomber - but there was more that just a few extra "console bits" to
 distance this from his previous game (MEGAMAN 6 on the NES). Possibly scared
 that they were running out of respectable numbers, CAPCOM gave this game a
 much needed change of direction - set in the distant future, with an overly
 darker tone and all-new characters.

 This game would begin the "X" spin-off series - hence the next SNES Megaman
 game was called MEGAMAN 7, and did feature a return to the original series
 for the first time in 16bit. Although the two Megaman characters might appear
 similar, our hero in this game is simply known as X, and has learned a few
 new tricks too.

 The general format of the game remains the same - as before there are eight
 adversaries to defeat, each at the end of their own level, and which can be
 chosen in any order. When you defeat each boss you obtain its special weapon
 (sound familiar), and which helps you greatly when playing the rest of the
 game. Apart from a few other slight differences there was nothing that anyone
 who had played a previous MEGAMAN game wouldn't quickly pick up.

 Within two years this new series had spawned two sequels, with a 32bit fourth
 instalment predictably arriving in 1997. Each game introduced many new
 friends and adversaries for our hero, but it was the psychotic super-robot
 SIGMA who provided the final challenge in each. Two more recent 32bit
 instalments have bought the series up to its 6th episode(!), but Megaman X4
 was the last to be released here in the UK.

                                   WARNING:

        "X" IS THE FIRST OF A NEW GENERATION OF ROBOTS WHICH CONTAIN AN
        INNOVATIVE NEW FEATURE - THE ABILITY TO THINK, FEEL AND MAKE
        THEIR OWN DECISIONS. HOWEVER THIS ABILITY COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS.
        IF "X" WERE TO BREAK THE FIRST RULE OF ROBOTICS, "A ROBOT MUST
        NEVER HARM A HUMAN BEING", THE RESULTS WOULD BE DISASTROUS AND
        I FEAR THAT NO FORCE ON EARTH COULD STOP HIM.
        APPROXIMATELY 30 YEARS WILL BE REQUIRED BEFORE WE CAN SAFELY
        CONFIRM HIS RELIABILITY. UNFORTUNATELY I WILL NOT LIVE TO SEE THAT
        DAY, NOR DO I HAVE ANYONE TO CARRY ON MY WORK. THEREFORE, I HAVE
        DECIDED TO SEAL HIM IN THIS CAPSULE, WHICH WILL TEST HIS INTERNAL
        SYSTEMS UNTIL HIS RELIABILITY HAS BEEN CONFIRMED. PLEASE DO NO
        DISTURB THE CAPSULE UNTIL THAT TIME.
        "X" POSSESSES GREAT RISKS AS WELL AS GREAT POSSIBILITIES. I CAN
        HOPE FOR THE BEST.

                                 SEPTEMBER 18, 20XX
                                                         T. LIGHT

 You have to read the game manual to get a better idea of the actual story,
 which centres around an archaeologist named Dr. CAIN who stumbles upon the
 remains of what was Dr. Thomas LIGHTS Laboratory (Dr. LIGHT Invented the
 original MEGAMAN). Inside he discovered a capsule containing a robot simply
 named X - and the warning shown above, but all the lengthy system checks
 seemed to have been completed on him. Realising Dr. LIGHTS genius, Dr. CAIN
 witnessed a robot that could think and make its own decisions in an almost
 human way. With Dr. LIGHT'S knowledge, Dr. CAIN hoped to create a new era of
 robotics.

 X helped Dr. CAIN create a replica, from now on know as a "REPLOID", and it
 seemed to function ok. Within months the REPLOIDS where running off the
 assembly line, and most people seemed to accept them and the jobs they
 performed. After a while, it was clear that all was not well - certain robots
 were going MAVERICK and harming people before they could be shut down. The
 people's reaction was mixed simply because of the dependency on REPLOIDS, and
 so instead a new group of REPLOIDS were assigned to stop these malfunctioning
 machines - known as the MAVERICK HUNTERS and led by the incredibly
 intelligent SIGMA!
 
 All went well for a while, with only X's constant wondering about his role in
 life seeming to disturb him. Eventually though, SIGMA also went MAVERICK, and
 took most of the HUNTERS with him. In the thinking that REPLOIDS are more
 intelligent than humans, they are preventing their development - and so must
 be eradicated! With the terrified humans fleeing the city, X is very
 distressed by these events and decides to join the MAVERICK HUNTERS and their
 new leader, ZERO...


-[2.02]---------------------------GAMEPLAY-------------------------------------

SET-UP:

 PASSWORDS:
 This game uses a password system to save your progress, so remember to write
 this down as you progress through the game - you get one whenever you leave
 a stage regardless of the circumstances. You can re-enter your password from
 the title screen later, which will restore your exact status to the stage
 select screen. In some cases, certain special events WILL NOT be saved, and
 this includes your progress through the four final SIGMA stages.

 OPTION MODE:
 From the title screen you can also choose the options menu, offering a nice
 sound test and the ability to reconfig your buttons (I find it easier to
 switch the dash button to R on the top of the pad) - but unfortunately there
 is no difficulty option.


SKILLS:

 CHARGING:
 You standard weapon is the trusty X-Buster, for which you can rely on to
 defeat any enemy in the game, albeit with varying levels of ease. It will
 never run out of ammo, and can be charged up to 2 higher damaging levels.
 Simply hold the fire button down, and as soon as you see X begin to absorb
 energy then he is ready to fire the medium shot (1 second approx.). Hold the
 fire button down slightly longer (2 seconds approx.) and the energy absorbed
 will turn yellow, enabling you to fire the larger shot.

 Later in the game you will acquire the ability to charge up to an even higher
 level - hold down the button for even longer and the energy absorbed will
 turn pink (3 seconds approx.), which releases an awesome pink wave of energy.

 STATUS SCREEN:
 Pressing the START button during the game will immediately bring up the
 STATUS SCREEN - displaying the number of lives, various energy levels for any
 weapons or SUB TANKS you have obtained (see below), and also providing an
 EXIT function if you are returning to an already completed stage (taking you
 back to the stage select). From here the game is effectively paused, allowing
 you to choose your weapon or use a SUB TANK without hindrance.

 WEAPON SELECT:
 In this game you can cycle through the special weapons you have obtained by
 pressing buttons L or R (L or A if you change them like I do), although it is
 probably still easier just to press start and choose one from the status
 screen. Pressing R will cycle forward, while pressing L will cycle through in
 reverse order - you can also revert immediately back to the X-Buster by
 pressing both buttons simultaneously.

 WALL CLIMB:
 The wall climb is a new skill unique to Megaman X, and is an invaluable
 tactic for avoiding death on many occasions. When X is falling or jumping
 next to a wall, press the jump button and he will propel from it - this is
 made slightly easier if you hold the joypad towards the wall, which makes X
 slide slowly down it. This tactic allows easy navigation of vertical walls
 right from the start, and is something that you will need to do a lot of
 (this is something that the original MEGAMAN still cannot do).


REGULAR ITEMS:

 ENERGY CAPSULES:
 When you start the game you will see your LIFE BAR in the top left, which
 provides 16 easily lost bars of energy - so you need to be careful and
 constantly on the look out for energy capsules. There are two types of these
 - small and large, both of which can be found scattered all over the levels,
 but most often appear randomly from destroyed enemies.

 WEAPON CAPSULES:
 Two similar items that you will come across are the blue weapon capsules,
 which recharge the energy of any special weapons you might have obtained.
 Weapons gained from each defeated MAVERICK will drain WEAPON ENERGY as you
 use them - which is denoted by a separate bar that appears to the right of
 your LIFE BAR when you select one. If the current weapon is at full energy,
 then the power will automatically be transferred to the weapon in your
 inventory which has the lowest energy.

 EXTRA LIFE:
 There is also a less common item that can be found scattered around a few of
 the levels, or possibly dropped by destroyed enemies - a Megaman head,
 providing you with a much needed EXTRA LIFE.


SPECIAL ITEMS:

 The Special items can only be found hidden throughout the eight regular
 stages, and usually require a lot of skill to locate or obtain.

 HEART TANK:
 The HEART TANK extends your maximum LIFE BAR by two small bars, of which
 there are Eight in the game - one on each MAVERICK stage (collect them all to
 effectively double your LIFE BAR).

 SUB TANK:
 The SUB TANK (of which there are four) allows you to store surplus energy,
 meaning that any energy capsules collected when you are at full power will
 instead be stored and not wasted. When you run low of energy, simply select
 a SUB TANK from the status screen and press Y - it will then completely empty
 into your LIFE BAR (filling up to 14 bars).


UPGRADES:

 Megaman X's final surprise is the new UPGRADE system. There are five capsules
 hidden throughout the eight regular stages, and each provides X with an
 enhancement that not only makes the character look cooler, but provides
 abilities that are invaluable for your survival later on.

 DASH UPGRADE (Found on CHILL PENGUIN'S stage):
 This is the easiest to obtain, and also the MOST important. Without this you
 will not be able to obtain any of the other upgrades, or many of the special
 items - not to mention the fact that most bosses are considerably more
 difficult without it! You cannot avoid picking up this upgrade during CHILL
 PENGUIN'S stage, but you should still aim to get it as early as possible.

 Simply press the assigned dash button (or double tap in the direction you're
 facing) and X will boost forward - best used in conjunction with the jump
 button. With good timing you can also use this to jump further off of the
 walls, and just by having this upgrade you can break certain bricks by
 jumping against them.

 ARMOUR UPGRADE (Found on STING CHAMELEON'S stage):
 This is the second most important upgrade, which simply halves all of the
 damage you receive, but you still need to be wary of Instant Death
 situations!

 HELMET UPGRADE (Found on STORM EAGLE'S stage):
 This is the least most useful upgrade, which simply allows X to destroy
 breakable bricks by bashing them with his head. It only has one positive use
 in the game, which is to obtain the.....

 X-BUSTER UPGRADE (Found on FLAME MAMMOTH'S STAGE):
 You will eventually obtain this upgrade during the course of the game even if
 you fail to gain it on FLAME MAMMOTH'S stage - but at a much later point in
 SIGMA'S fortress. It allows you to charge your normal X-Buster to a higher
 level, but more importantly is the added ability to charge the weapons you
 gain from each MAVERICK.

 HADOUKEN UPGRADE (Found on ARMORED ARMADILLO'S STAGE):
 The hardest Upgrade to find, and one which provides the most amazing power to
 wield. Press the Joypad DOWN, then FORWARD, then FIRE to perform RYU'S
 trademark move from STREET FIGHTER 2. It can only be performed when you have
 a full LIFE BAR, but defeats enemies and MAVERICKS (including SIGMA!) with
 just one hit!!!


MAVERICK WEAPONS:

 SHOTGUN ICE (S.ICE):
 Fires a fast shot which rebounds and sprays into 5 smaller (but equally
 damaging) shots when it hits a wall. Charge it up to create an ice platform
 that will slide forward along any flat surface and can be stood on - it will
 only break against strong enemies or if it hits a wall.
 
 ELECTRIC SPARK (E.SPARK):
 Fires a medium speed shot that splits into two sparks that hug the walls on
 contact. Charged up will create a powerful electric wall that fires both back
 and forward.

 ROLLING SHIELD (R.SHIELD):
 Fires a slow moving forcefield that rolls forward, rebounding once from a
 wall and rolling indefinitely before crashing into a second wall or enemy.
 Charged up will create a permanent force field around X which can destroy all
 weak enemies, but will be absorbed by anything stronger.

 HOMING TORPEDO (HOMING.T):
 Fires a slow moving missile that will seek and follow an enemy - a maximum of
 2 can be fired at once. Charged up will create 5 fish missiles that will also
 home in on enemies, but are much more damaging.

 BOOMERANG CUTTER (B.CUTTER):
 Fires a medium speed boomerang that circles a short range in an upwards arc
 (occasionally a downwards arc while jumping). You can fire a maximum of 3 at
 a time, and they will all return to you unless they leave the screen or hit
 an enemy (WEAPON ENERGY will increase when reclaimed). Another benefit from
 this useful weapon is the way it grabs onto both regular and special items,
 and then brings them to you - which is the only way to obtain some of them.
 Charged up this will produce 4 large green boomerangs that will circle the
 screen in all directions before leaving (you will not get the energy back).

 CHAMELEON STING (C.STING):
 Sprays 3 fast green laser beams forward, but charged up will make you
 transparent (invincible) for just under 10 seconds - during which for can
 move through enemies and even over spikes. You can also fire the CHAMELEON
 STING while transparent.

 STORM TORNADO (STORM.T):
 This creates a long stream of air in front of you that hovers briefly before
 shooting forward - excellent against enemies that require multiple hits to
 destroy. Charged up will create a huge tornado around you, severely damaging
 anything close, above or below you.

 FIRE WAVE (FIRE.W)
 You can hold the button down for a short-range but constant stream of fire.
 This flame-thrower attack will charge up automatically if you have the
 X-BUSTER UPGRADE, so you might want to tap the button instead. Charge it up
 to shoot a flame into the ground - creating a wall of fire that travels
 forward along flat surfaces. This weapon is also excellent against stronger
 enemies but remember that it will not work while you are underwater, so be
 careful!


===============================================================================
 [3]                            WALKTHROUGH
===============================================================================

-[3.01]------------------------Highway Stage-----------------------------------

 The first MEGAMAN game to feature the now customary introduction level, which
 takes place on a collapsing highway, and populated with all sorts of robotic
 enemies as well as cosmetic vehicles fleeing the Reploid overrun city. You
 just need to head right, constantly charging the X-Buster helps because the
 largest shot can destroy many enemies at once. Small flying enemies attempt
 to destroy the floor, but pose little worry, but a few larger enemies tend to
 take many hits. There is a section where you have to fight a large robotic
 wasp-like flying enemy, and you will need to use the new wall climb after it.

 There is an identical situation right after, with another giant wasp like
 thing - just keep blasting it while avoiding its missiles. Shortly after a
 few collapsing platforms you will see enemy cars driving towards you - just
 keep shooting to slow them down. If you don't kill the driver and attempt to
 jump over them, then the car will turn around and chase you.

|----------------------------|
|---------| Boss |-----------| A large spaceship will drop a few more car
|----------------------------| enemies onto the ground before VILE appears.
|                            | VILE is the small purple guy in the giant
| Name:                 VILE | Ride-Armour, and no matter how much you avoid
| Difficulty:      Very Easy | him or fight back, he will eventually pummel
| Normal X Shots:         NA | you into submission. Just before you are dead,
| Large X Shots:          NA | he will stop running into you and try to hit
| Weakness:               NA | you with a paralysing weapon (so you can't beat
|                            | him, but it is possible to actually die on him
|----------------------------| - albeit unlikely).

 After a mocking speech, a red robot called ZERO shows up and blasts the arm
 off of VILE'S Ride-Armour, after which VILE makes a hasty retreat. X is
 reassured by ZERO that he will soon get stronger, possibly even as strong as
 him one day! ZERO then departs for SIGMA'S fortress, while X goes on a quest
 to build his strength and abilities up.


-[3.02]-------------------------Stage Select-----------------------------------

 A new twist this time, no longer do we have humanoid robots all ending in
 ***man, but all of X's adversaries now resemble various animal like forms
 (which is also hinted in their name). You can click on SPEC/STAGE/MAP on this
 screen before highlighting each MAVERICK to get an idea of each ones stage
 and abilities, although this is mostly cosmetic and helps little. While it is
 possible to defeat a number of the MAVERICKS from the start, it is only
 something that the best players should attempt, and even then - some of these
 are nigh on impossible at this stage.

 Each of the eight MAVERICKS possess an obtainable weapon that badly damages
 another Maverick, so in theory it is best to tackle them in the same order
 regardless of who you start with, but this often means returning to previous
 levels to obtain important items - and so it is less efficient. Below is a
 guide to help you decide the order in which to tackle each stage.

BOSS ORDER (Clockwise):

 By using the first order (starting with Chill Penguin) you will always have
 the correct SPECIAL WEAPON to defeat the next boss. By using the second order
 (again starting with CHILL PENGUIN) you will only have to return to a stage
 once - so it is by far the most efficient (and only slightly more taxing). 

 (1) EASIEST:                            (2) OPTIMAL:

             CHILL PENGUIN                            CHILL PENGUIN
             /           \                            /           \
    FLAME MAMMOTH    SPARK MANDRILL         STING CHAMELEON   STORM EAGLE
           /               \                        /               \
    STORM EAGLE        ARMORED ARMADILLO   LAUNCH OCTOPUS       FLAME MAMMOTH
           \               /                        \               /
  STING CHAMELEON    LAUNCH OCTOPUS       ARMORED ARMADILLO   BOOMER KUWANGER
             \           /                            \           /
            BOOMER KUWANGER                           SPARK MANDRILL


 When using the OPTIMAL order, note that it is actually possible to place
 either LAUNCH OCTOPUS' or ARMORED ARMADILLO'S stage at any point in the ring
 - this is simply because neither stage requires any items or upgrades to
 obtain every item on the level. The only exception to this rule is that STING
 CHAMELEON *MUST* be chosen *AFTER* LAUNCH OCTOPUS so that the level will
 flood - allowing you to reach a vital SPECIAL ITEM. All of the other other
 levels must be done in the order stated, leaving you needing only to revisit
 CHILL PENGUIN'S stage to collect the HEART TANK.

BOSS AND STAGE DIFFICULTY (When chosen first):

 The BOSS table assumes you will collect any possible power-ups from the level
 before fighting the boss (e.g. if you select ARMORED ARMADILLO first, you can
 still easily obtain both the HEART TANK and the SUB TANK - whereas if
 choosing STING CHAMELEON first you will be unable to pick up any of the
 levels special items).

 The STAGE difficulty table in mainly ranked on aspects such as the overall
 size and the number of instant death situations - although to be honest, none
 of the level can really be classed as difficult.

-[3.03]---------------Snow Mountain Stage: CHILL PENGUIN-----------------------

 This stage is the obvious first choice because not only is it an easy level,
 but you will obtain the DASH UPGRADE at no real effort. Just head right and
 then up (remember to use the wall climb jump), and you will easily find the
 capsule blocking your path. The accelerator system (DASH UPGRADE) is a must
 at this early stage, giving you a longer jump when used together, and which
 can also be used when jumping from the wall (very helpful against the
 bosses).

 Shortly after, you will find a Ride-Armour suit similar to the one used by
 VILE on the Highway Stage. While using this armour you can smash the ice
 covered houses, and if you jump out of it while it is also jumping, you can
 get some extra height. Right after the Ride-Armour is a situation like this,
 you can either go through the cave, or jump up and then out of the armour and
 go across the top. It is slightly easier to go over, although you might want
 to muck around in the Ride-Armour for a while (remember to jump out of the
 armour if you fall into a hole inside the cave - you can easily wall climb
 out).

 Over the top of the cave are more of those small iced buildings, but you are
 unable to destroy these unless you have the FIRE WAVE from FLAME MAMMOTH.
 Inside the first small building is the HEART TANK for this level (come back
 here later). As you continue on you suddenly find snow balls being thrown at
 you, these are pretty easy to avoid, and when you reach the boss-door, keep
 destroying the robots that throw them to get energy capsules (full energy is
 a must for any boss battle). Then enter the door to face CHILL PENGUIN...


|----------------------------|
|---------| Boss |-----------| CHILL PENGUIN is small compared to some of the
|----------------------------| others, giving a large area to avoid him. He
|                            | often jumps across the screen in an attempt
| Name:        CHILL PENGUIN | to hit you (contact is very damaging), but
| Height:             5.34ft | you should easily be able to avoid it. When
| Weight:              237lb | he lands he sometimes breathes icy breath,
| Difficulty:           Easy | creating two ice statures that remain on the
| Normal X Shots:         32 | level until destroyed (and also damage on
| Large X Shots:          10 | contact), his breath can also freezes you
| Weakness:        FIRE WAVE | temporarily if you are close enough, giving
|                  (11 Hits) | him a damaging free hit. Sometimes while
|----------------------------| jumping he might grab the hook in the middle 
                               on the ceiling instead, summoning an icy wind
 that blows you either left or right, also sending any statues smashing into
 the wall. He can also shoot slow or fast ice rocks at you, although these
 stop if they hit an ice statue (so you can hide behind them). His final
 attack is the Slide, where he shoots forward on his stomach - also very
 damaging.

 As long as you hit him with Charged shots, and remain on the walls (just
 watch for him jumping when he is near to the wall you are climbing), you can
 defeat him quite easily. Just hit him constantly, the easiest time being
 when he jumps, lands or finishes a slide attack.

 Using the FIRE WAVE doesn't really make him much easier, although you can now
 destroy the ice statues almost immediately. He will still jump around and
 slide on his stomach, so you still need to be careful while on the ground.
 The charged up FIRE WAVE is completely useless because it is so hard to hit
 him with and will run out after about 4 or 5 hits. Because the Fire Wave
 requires you to hold down the fire button, it will charge up automatically
 anyway - which is more of a hindrance during the battle.


-[3.04]---------------Power Plant Stage: SPARK MANDRILL------------------------

 This stage is one of the more difficult ones, so you need to watch out for
 the constant sparks shooting across parts of the floor. These sparks will
 disappear after you defeat STORM EAGLE (looks like the remains of his plane
 at the start?), but this will cause some areas to plunge into darkness -
 making a few sections more difficult.

 Shortly from the start you have two ladders, the one going down leads to a
 SUB TANK, but you cannot get it until you have defeated BOOMER KUWANGER so
 just go up (use his BOOMERANG CUTTER to snatch the SUB TANK later). It will
 soon get dark, and fast flying enemies will try to knock you off platforms to
 your death - so remember to wall climb back up if you can't avoid them (just
 stop and wait if this part goes completely dark).

 The mid level boss is quite tough, so try not to get stuck to the floor when
 it starts bouncing around (move the d-pad left and right if you do get
 stuck). Just shoot it as much as you can when it lands on the floor and you
 can get it over with quite quickly. You can use the wall climb to hit it
 while it is high up, which is useful for when it shoots sparks downwards (if
 you had defeated STORM EAGLE then it can no longer shoot these sparks).

 After this you can then continue right - avoiding the wall turrets is easy,
 but the giant turtle enemies take many hits, so you will need to avoid the
 missiles they shoot back. When you come to a ladder going down, you can see
 the HEART TANK for this level - this can be obtained by dash-jumping from
 the right wall and then trying to just touch the ledge (needs good judgement
 as well as the DASH UPGRADE), or you can use the BOOMERANG CUTTER if you have
 it. Keep going and it will get dark like before, so watch out for those fast
 birds (try and anticipate when they fly across the screen to shoot them)
 before reaching the door.

|----------------------------|
|---------| Boss |-----------| SPARK MANDRILL is huuuge, but not impossible to
|----------------------------| beat even without the DASH UPGRADE. He only
|                            | has a few different attacks, his most damaging
| Name:       SPARK MANDRILL | being the dash punch - which takes off lots of
| Height:             10.0ft | energy, and tends to knock you off the wall
| Weight:              646lb | that he bashes (so you might land on him if you
| Difficulty:           Hard | climbed the wall to avoid it). The dash punch
| Normal X Shots:         32 | is a good move to counter however, so if you
| Large X Shots:          11 | anticipate it and hit him with a charged shot
| Weakness:      SHOTGUN ICE | - you will knock him back. Watch out if he
|                  (11 Hits) | repeats the punch however, you wont have enough 
|        Charged SHOTGUN ICE | time to charge up another shot, so its a good
|                   (8 Hits) | idea to prepare to jump against the wall and
|----------------------------| vault him afterwards. He also tries to jumps 
                               on you, but sometimes grabs the ceiling instead
 - slowly swinging across (also a good time to hit him with a charged shot).
 His special attack is when he punches the floor, sending two pink sparks (the
 ELECTRIC SPARK) each way hugging the arena wall (jump them and you can hit
 him with a charged shot).

 He is easy to hit, and charged shots damage him severely - so always have one
 ready and try to make them count. Hit him from the start because he usually
 does the dash punch, and prepare for his follow up because you can only take
 a few hits early on. When he hangs on the ceiling you can hit him at least
 twice, and he is particularly vulnerable during the ELECTRIC SPARK. As long
 as you avoid his contact and anticipate the Dash punch, you should be able to
 beat him first with practice.

 His weakness is the SHOTGUN ICE, with which you can just keep on hitting him
 over and over to freeze him, making him a doddle (shoot again just as he
 breaks free).


-[3.05]----------------Gallery Stage: ARMORED ARMADILLO------------------------

 The customary mine cart level is another tough stage - so jump on the cart at
 the beginning and shoot like crazy (enemies hit by the cart are killed
 instantly). If you jump off after the first downward slope you should see a
 bat that is considerably larger than the normal ones - blast this for an
 almost certain EXTRA LIFE, and then keep walking forward and back to refresh
 the enemies for more lives from it! If you stayed on the cart you will hit
 the wall at the end, so remember to jump off - the momentum throws you off a
 bit so be careful.

 When you reach the wall going down, slide down slowly until the rock-crusher
 goes past underneath, just behind it is a SUB TANK. This level is good for
 filling your SUB TANKS, so boss fights from now on will be slightly fairer.
 Just follow the rock-crusher until it destroys itself, and carry on until you
 reach the next mine cart.

 When you jump off you have another vertical wall to slide down, but this time
 you want to get in front of the rock-crusher - so stay to the right as you
 descend (touching its front is instant death). Go on ahead until you see the
 HEART TANK above (you cannot reach this if the rock-crusher went in front),
 and then wait for the rock-crusher to go past below and destroy itself again.
 It is possible to destroy the rock-crusher using the X-Buster, and before it
 reaches the HEART TANK - but unless you are quick on the buttons you will
 need either the STORM TORNADO or the FIRE WAVE. Right after this is the final
 mine cart ride, so shoot like crazy and remember to jump off at the end -
 just before the door to ARMORED ARMADILLO.

|----------------------------|
|---------| Boss |-----------| This small Boss is annoying because he will
|----------------------------| almost always block your shots, and even when
|                            | you hit him you don't do much damage (charged
| Name:    ARMORED ARMADILLO | hits do no extra damage). His main attack is
| Height:             6.36ft | to roll up into a ball and bounce around the
| Weight:              510lb | screen at 45 degree angles (you need to judge
| Difficulty:   Intermediate | where he will hit regardless of where you are
| Normal X Shots:         32 | on  the screen) - this is very damaging and you
| Large X Shots:          32 | will probably need that SUB TANK from earlier
| Weakness:   ELECTRIC SPARK | after a few hits. You can usually get a hit in
|                  (11 Hits) | just as he comes out of the roll, and just as
|     Charged ELECTRIC SPARK | he enters it if you are quick. When he stands
|                   (5 Hits) | still he will begin shooting small shots at
|----------------------------| you, this is easiest time hit him even though 
                               he will still block some of your shots. If he
 blocks a charged shot he will absorb it and release a blast of energy in many
 directions (very damaging).

 I prefer to remain on the left side for the entire battle, where you should
 eventually notice a pattern in his roll attack (knowing when to be either up
 the left wall, or on the ground to avoid it). When he jumps out of his roll
 attack you want to shoot him constantly - hitting him a few times while
 avoiding the small laser beams he fires back. Because of the high number of
 hits he takes to kill, this battle will last quite a while - so your only
 real worry is the occasional lack of judgement...

 If you have the ENERGY SPARK you just need to hit him properly once - he can
 block this as before, but as soon as you DO hit him he will lose his armour,
 allowing you to keep hitting him no matter what he does. Without his armour
 he cannot even block X-Buster shots, but try and hit him as often as possible
 with the ENERGY SPARK because he still has a lot of vitality.


-[3.06]------------------Ocean Stage: LAUNCH OCTOPUS---------------------------

 This level takes place mostly underwater, allowing you to jump higher but
 very slowly (hold the jump button to jump really high). Keep going across the
 seabed until you stop to fight a large fish, this will shoot eels at you that
 are annoying to avoid, he also tries to draw you in - not too difficult. You
 will then come across many fish that will try to suck you inside them, these
 do not appear to damage you but actually drain you energy quite rapidly after
 a few seconds if you do nothing - so shoot to escape from their stomach. The
 second pause is another of those giant fish's, except this time parts of the
 ground have spikes, and so you need to be extra careful when he draws you
 towards him (jumping high helps you land back on the small floor section).

 Soon after you will find whirlpool machines that you can use to climb to the
 water surface, the second of which allows you to jump onto a Whale like boat
 which can be sunk after a pummelling (shoot the orb on the top). When the
 Whale sinks it destroys the spiked ground on the seabed, revealing a large
 fighting area and a serpent like mini-boss. You can stand on is back as it
 weaves around the area, making it easier to hit its head and tail weakpoints.
 If you have the STORM TORNADO you can defeat it in just a few hits, but
 always be wary of the spike patches below. When you destroy it, a small cave
 appears to the right which contains the HEART TANK.

 Head back left and up to the main path and continue to another pause, here
 you fight another of those serpents, although the shallower water means you
 can't stay on its back for as long. Destroy it and walk up to the boss door
 (there are no enemies to obtain energy capsules from so you might not be in a
 good position to do him first time).

|----------------------------|
|---------| Boss |-----------| This underwater boss is a really tough one, but
|----------------------------| still possible to defeat very early on. He will
|                            | mainly stand or hop forward while firing three
| Name:       LAUNCH OCTOPUS | missiles at you, so keep your distance and
| Height:             7.80ft | continuously fire normal shots - by standing
| Weight:              348lb | your ground you can destroy these missiles and
| Difficulty:      Very Hard | hit him in-between (so don't bother to charge).
| Normal X Shots:         32 | He less frequently fires 4 fish like homing
| Large X Shots:          11 | missiles (you can prepare because he waves his
| Weakness:   ROLLING SHIELD | arms before firing them), which are harder to
|                  (11 Hits) | avoid and more damaging. His last attack is to
|           BOOMERANG CUTTER | jump up and create a whirlpool that tries to
|   (3 Hits to cut off arms) | draw you inside - so watch out for this if you
|----------------------------| do not have the DASH UPGRADE because you will
                               not be able to escape from it. If you do have
 the DASH UPGRADE then you can easily avoid this and even escape if you do
 get caught in it - allowing you more time to charge up your X-Buster and hit
 him when he stops spinning. If you do get caught, he will move down and suck
 your energy (healing himself too), so wiggle the joypad to escape with
 minimum damage.

 The best tactic is just stay away from him and shoot - only hitting him with
 charged shots when he is in the air. This battle is only difficult because
 the fish missiles are so hard to avoid, and you will almost certainly need a
 lucky match if you don't have the DASH UPGRADE or a SUB TANK.

 LAUNCH OCTOPUS' weakness is the ROLLING SHIELD, which damages him badly, but
 will be used up quickly because you need to use it to destroy the missiles
 too. From the start just walk towards him and unload the ROLLING SHIELD
 continuously, he will have about a third of his energy left when it runs out,
 so revert to the X-Buster and you should beat him comfortably (hopefully).

 Strangely this boss has a second weakness which is overall more effective
 than his true weakness. If you have the BOOMERANG CUTTER, you just need to
 hit him with it three times (normal or charged) to remove his arms. Without
 his arms he loses the ability to fire the homing fish missiles or use his
 whirlpool attack. All he is left with is those easily countered rockets,
 making him one of the easiest battles!


-[3.07]------------------Tower Stage: BOOMER KUWANGER--------------------------

 This level takes place inside a tower, and the direction you travel most is
 up - so be prepared to climb. Various ladders help you most of the time, but
 make use of the wall climb to quickly reach the top of the short first
 section. You soon have to go right past laser detectors turning on and off -
 break any of theses beams and the guns will shoot you. Its difficult not to
 get hit a few times and so the best tactic here is to just sprint dash (using
 the DASH UPGRADE) all the way through regardless - proving too quick for the
 guns to hit you before you reach the end. Continue up and you will soon come
 to a fast moving lift taking you even higher, here you have to avoid instant
 death spikes as well as flying enemies - the walls on the side also kill
 instantly. You then move outside, here you need to use the wall climb
 ability, made slightly harder by the presence of gun turrets popping out of
 the wall.
 
 At the top you can clearly see the HEART TANK for this level, which you can
 easily grab later on with the weapon from this levels boss (use the BOOMERANG
 CUTTER). If you already have both the SHOTGUN ICE and the X-BUSTER UPGRADE
 however, it is possible ride the charged up ice platform off the edge and
 jump up onto the ledge (needs good timing). Continue up afterwards,
 destroying the enemies on the platforms so you can ride them up to entrance
 to the boss room.

|----------------------------|
|---------| Boss |-----------| I have no idea what this thing is supposed to
|----------------------------| be, but this quick boss is more difficult to 
|                            | defeat unless you have the either the DASH 
| Name:      BOOMER KUWANGER | UPGRADE or the HOMING TORPEDO weapon (or just 
| Height:             7.93ft | lots of energy). His main attack either way is 
| Weight:              206lb | the teleport, and he seems to make a nasty 
| Difficulty:   Intermediate | habit of appearing in front of you regardless 
| Normal X Shots:         32 | of which way you move (often making contact for 
| Large X Shots:          11 | big damage). He can also charge into you, and 
| Weakness:   HOMING TORPEDO | likes following up both these attacks with the 
|                  (11 hits) | damaging "Dead Lift" - where he lifts you up 
|     Charged HOMING TORPEDO | with his horns and throws you into the ceiling. 
|                   (8 Hits) | If you face him Without the DASH UPGRADE, then
|----------------------------| these two attacks are quite hard to avoid 
                               unless you stay high up the walls. His final
 move is the BOOMERANG CUTTER, where he removes his horns a throws them
 towards you, but this often misses and is not particularly damaging anyway -
 usually done if you are up a wall when he stops.

 My best tactic is to just keep wall climbing on either side, and then jumping
 over him when he appears below - usually pausing to get a charged shot in
 before jumping up the other wall. By doing this he almost constantly
 teleports, pausing only to throw the BOOMERANG CUTTER which as also a good
 time to hit him - he cannot teleport while the boomerang is travelling
 through the air, so make use of this vulnerability.

 If you have the HOMING TORPEDOES then BOOMER KUWANGER is very easy indeed -
 just shoot them one at a time and they will always hit him. Because he can
 still teleport next to you, you cannot just stand still and fire away, so the
 best place to be is either of the top corners - here you can just shoot
 continuously.


-[3.08]------------------Forest Stage: STING CHAMELEON-------------------------

 This Stage is a poor first choice because none of the cool bonuses can be
 obtained without the DASH UPGRADE. At the start are more of those annoying
 wood cutting robots, so have the charged shot ready to destroy the tree's
 they hide behind. Not far from the start is a vertical cliff face at the
 entrance to a cave (where rock-robots fall inside) - dash jump and climb this
 cliff face instead of going inside the cave. At the top you will be caved-in
 to face a giant green robot with pincer claws - this is Dr. Light's test for
 the second most-important upgrade, the ARMOUR UPGRADE.

 This mini boss is not too hard, and his moves are not particularly damaging
 either, but he does take a lot of hits. He will jump to where you are
 standing most of the time, so always move when he jumps. His other attack is
 to extend his claw about 2 thirds a screen in length, sometimes grabbing and
 smashing you into the wall - but this is also pretty weak. Just keep dashing
 from wall to wall, and concentrate on shooting his head with charged shots
 (he takes 64 regular hits and 32 of the larger shot!!!!). Afterwards take
 the ARMOUR UPGRADE, which will help you considerably from now on (all damage
 is halved). Also, by destroying this secret boss, there will be no more rocks
 falling in the cave below.

 Go back and slide down the cliff face, right at the bottom is a small hole in
 the floor - slide down here to find a secret area leading to the HEART TANK.
 If you have defeated LAUNCH OCTOPUS, this area will be filled with water,
 which is vital to reaching the HEART TANK. If you have the DASH UPGRADE you
 can destroy the wall by jumping against it, and now its a leap of faith as
 far to the right as you can. When you reach the small ledge, grab the HEART
 TANK and attempt to jump all the way back - easier if you slide down the
 ledge before jumping. Now climb back up and continue through the level. There
 is an EXTRA LIFE in plain view shortly before a suit of Ride-Armour. Grab
 this and head right, jumping to avoid the swamp that slows you down. Shortly
 ahead is the door to the boss.

|----------------------------|
|---------| Boss |-----------| The Chameleon boss is a very difficult foe to
|----------------------------| beat early on, but if you had the DASH UPGRADE
|                            | and then acquired the ARMOUR UPGRADE from this
| Name:      STING CHAMELEON | level, he becomes quite easy. The top of the
| Height:             5.80ft | arena is covered in spikes that are incredibly
| Weight:              169lb | damaging (even with the ARMOUR UPGRADE), so be
| Difficulty:           Hard | careful when climbing up the walls. His main
| Normal X Shots:         20 | manoeuvre is the invisibility (being a
| Large X Shots:          16 | Chameleon he blends in with the background),
| Weakness: BOOMERANG CUTTER | crawling across the arena and re-appearing
|                  (11 hits) | either high or low. You can usually make out
|   Charged BOOMERANG CUTTER | where he crawling, giving a split second to
|                   (8 Hits) | react before he reappears, and which is vital
|----------------------------| to avoiding the devastating tongue attack he
                               usually does when he appears low (but this is
 still hard to avoid without the DASH UPGRADE). If he appears high, he can
 use his special weapon - the CHAMELEON STING, where he sprays three green
 spikes multiple times (not too damaging). Wherever he appears, he can also
 drop to the ground before jumping up to the ceiling and swinging from his
 tongue - this shakes spikes from the ceiling that are hard to avoid but also
 not very damaging.

 Because he disappears quite quickly you need to move fast if you want to hit
 him after avoiding his attacks. He is vulnerable during all his attacks,
 particularly when he sprays the CHAMELEON STING. When he swings from the
 ceiling you don't need to jump off the walls to hit him, he is low enough to
 hit with charged jump shots. If you see him about to reappear low, its really
 best to just concentrate on avoiding his tongue attack.

 If you have the BOOMERANG CUTTER then he is very easy even without any of the
 upgrades - and because the Boomerang goes in a high loop you can hit him even
 when he is high up. Every time you hit him he will fall down and jump up to
 the opposite side (almost always starting the tongue swing) - where you can
 knock him down again and repeat. Just watch out for him falling onto you if
 you knock him down from high above you.


-[3.09]--------------------Sky Stage: STORM EAGLE------------------------------

 A different stage compared to those so far, with good jumping and judgement
 required from the start. Head up from the beginning, carefully jumping from
 the small platforms while avoiding those annoying enemies that pick you up.
 You can destroy parts of the right wall where you can see platforms (only
 hiding large energy capsules), and when you reach the very top you should
 dash jump as far to the left as you can (need the DASH UPGRADE), to obtain
 the HEART TANK for this level. Drop down after and make your way all the way
 back to the top to carry on.

 Back at the top you will soon come to more platforms to navigate (destroy the
 turrets on each platform), but from here you can instead head up and left to
 reach the control tower. Just shoot the glass to easily obtain a SUB TANK,
 and then drop back down and head right. Without the DASH UPGRADE you will
 have to wait for the next platform to be lower than the one you are on before
 jumping to it, so you might have to judge where it is if you can't see it
 below you. At the end of this section is another wall to destroy, and inside
 is an EXTRA LIFE.

 Right after this is a tall mast to climb, taking you even higher, so climb it
 but slide down the other side instead of jumping to the higher Platform - and
 from here you can dash jump (need the DASH UPGRADE) to a right platform with
 another of those destroyable walls. Inside here is the HELMET UPGRADE, which
 allows you to destroy certain bricks in a "Super Mario Bros" style. Apart
 from looking pretty cool it does little else. Return back up to the main
 path and continue right (you can easily see another easy EXTRA LIFE). Just
 before the boss is a section where you have to jump onto a plane using
 platforms that fall when you land on them - needless to say be quick to jump
 off. Walk off the right edge of the plane instead of going through the door
 find a large weapon and energy capsule - then jump on the platform to face
 STORM EAGLE.

|----------------------------|
|---------| Boss |-----------| STORM EAGLE flaps his wings, blowing you back 
|----------------------------| from the start (ultimately trying to push you 
|                            | off the edge) - so without the DASH UPGRADE you 
| Name:          STORM EAGLE | need to run desperately against it to make back 
| Height:             8.20ft | some ground. He might fly upwards and hover 
| Weight:              275lb | before splitting out an egg that 4 robot birds
| Difficulty:   Intermediate | hatch from and chase you - but if you time a 
| Normal X Shots:         32 | charged blast right, you can destroy all four 
| Large X Shots:          16 | with one hit. While hovering he will either 
| Weakness:  CHAMELEON STING | land again, or disappear upwards - and begin to 
|                  (11 hits) | dive-bomb you. This is his most damaging
|----------------------------| attack, and unless you take action to evade it
                               he will always hit you - so move constantly. He
 will later fly down from the top of the screen and hover once more, before
 possibly landing or disappearing upwards again and dive-bombing. If he lands
 he will try to blow you off the edge again, sometimes using his special
 weapon instead - the STORM TORNADO, which pushes you back with much more
 force than his wings but can be jumped to gain more ground, and also doesn't
 damage.

 You can easily hit him when he hovers or lands with a charged shot, and if
 you are quick also when he dive-bombs (although just evading this attack is
 more important). If you have the DASH UPGRADE you can nail him constantly by
 shooting and dashing as he blows you back. As long as you concentrate on
 avoiding him you can beat this boss quite early in the game, just watch for
 him blowing you off the edge if you do not have the DASH UPGRADE.

 Using the CHAMELEON STING only makes it easier to hit him, but charging it up
 to turn yourself invincible will prevent him from hitting you with the
 dive-bomb or the STORM TORNADO - very helpful.


-[3.10]------------------Factory Stage: FLAME MAMMOTH--------------------------

 This shortish stage is a melting factory, so watch out for the robotic junk
 on the conveyer belts that can knock you into the very damaging lava (some
 shoot laser beams, so be careful). By defeating CHILL PENGUIN you can freeze
 all the lava at the bottom, allowing you to avoid the conveyer belts by
 running underneath.

 After this you will fall down to a lower section, where you should notice
 smashable bricks above you, which is just before a large area. Remember that
 you need the HELMET UPGRADE and DASH UPGRADE beforehand - to reach this you
 need to dash jump from the higher right platform as far as you can, then just
 press the jump button rapidly and you should find yourself climbing up to a
 small hidden chamber (need good jump timing). If you fall down after smashing
 some bricks then you cannot get the upgrade without exiting the level. Inside
 the capsule is the X-BUSTER UPGRADE, which allows you to charge your normal
 X-Buster to a higher level (the energy will turn pink when it is ready), but
 more importantly is the new ability to charge the weapons you gain from each
 MAVERICK.

 Continue Right until you come to more platforms over lava, except these fire
 flames upwards, destroying parts of the floor (not if it was frozen though).
 This area is quite high and contains both the HEART TANK and SUB TANK for
 this level. To the far bottom right is the HEART TANK, which you can get even
 without having freezed the lava, but you will take serious damage so make
 sure you can take a few hits. After this head up to the top left to find an
 EXTRA LIFE, and from here you can dash jump left (need DASH UPGRADE) to find
 a small room behind smashable blocks. Get this and head back to the right
 where you will soon come to another conveyer section except this one has
 crushers (not an instant kill). Carry on and you will soon arrive at the
 boss door.

|----------------------------|
|---------| Boss |-----------| You fight this boss in an unusually long arena,
|----------------------------| with a conveyer belt floor which FLAME MAMMOTH
|                            | can change the direction of by calling out. He
| Name:        FLAME MAMMOTH | is pretty agile for an Mammoth, with his main
| Height:             10.5ft | attack simply trying to squash you by jumping
| Weight:              719lb | forward over a screens length - and even if he
| Difficulty:   Intermediate | misses, you will be stunned by the ground
| Normal X Shots:         32 | shaking (but not damaged). He will stop
| Large X Shots:          16 | in-between jumps to either spit tar from his
| Weakness:    STORM TORNADO | trunk (which slows you slightly if walked in),
|                  (11 Hits) | or shooting far reaching flames from his arm
|      Charged STORM TORNADO | gun. If he hits a blob of tar with his flame -
|                   (8 Hits) | it will ignite and burn away shortly, causing
|----------------------------| you damage if you touch it.

 Because the arena is so long it is very easy to just keep your distance and
 shoot him. It is a good idea to be on a wall if you can, which will prevent
 you from being stunned when he shakes the ground, although you can also avoid
 this by jumping just before he lands. When he gets close it is possible to
 stand right next to him and shoot continuously - as long as he just stands
 and shoots, his flames will simply fly over your head, but watch out for the
 conveyer belt trapping you between him and the wall. It's generally best to
 be on the side which is taking him backwards, so climb the wall behind if you
 cannot run underneath him - then jump over him when he comes close, and hit
 him again before moving to the far side. If you have the DASH UPGRADE then
 you will have a much easier time avoiding him, and should beat him in no
 time.

 If you have the STORM TORNADO you can just stand in front of him and fire
 away - you should hit him every time (just watch out for the conveyer drawing
 you towards him). He will probably fire back and still try to jump on you, so
 if you are low on energy or just don't want to get hit, just keep you
 distance when shooting as before.

 Similar to the tactic against LAUNCH OCTOPUS, you can use the BOOMERANG
 CUTTER to remove his trunk (just hit him 3 times). Without his trunk he is
 unable to drop blobs of tar, and is also unable to change the direction of
 the conveyer belt - but overall this doesn't effect the difficulty of the
 battle.


-[3.11]-----------------------HADOUKEN UPGRADE---------------------------------

 After defeating all eight MAVERICKS you will join ZERO at the entrance to
 SIGMA'S fortress, and after a short conversation you will return to the stage
 select. You can select SIGMA'S stage by choosing the bottom right box, but
 first you should return to some of the MAVERICK'S stages to pick up any
 missed items (although you can do this in-between SIGMA stages if you want
 - but I don't recommend it).

 The final upgrade can now be found at the end of ARMORED ARMADILLO'S stage
 after you have obtained all eight HEART TANKS, all four SUB TANKS, and the
 other four upgrades. Just make your way to the final mine cart ride, and when
 you jump off at the end just before the boss's door, jump up and get the
 energy capsule before jumping into the ravine to your death. Repeat this
 strange requirement four more times, making sure you have Full Energy and all
 full SUB TANKS on the fifth time - and you should see the final capsule on
 the cliff. You need a lot of lives for this, so make sure you get a maximum
 of nine from the "Fat Bat" at the start of this level (see ARMORED ARMADILLO
 stage guide above).

 With the HADOUKEN UPGRADE in your possession it's time to take on SIGMA!


-[3.12]-------------------------SIGMA STAGE 1----------------------------------

 SIGMA'S fortress is divided into 4 incredibly difficult stage's which must
 all be completed in one sitting - so passwords from now on will only remember
 special items collected from the regular stages (apart from the HADOUKEN
 UPGRADE).

 You will have another conversation with Zero at the start of the first stage,
 and he will then run off ahead and create a diversion allowing you to sneak
 in! Shortly after the start you will come to a very difficult section where
 you must make your way up the screen using moving platforms over a bottomless
 pit, and made all the more difficult by the quick flying enemies. If you have
 the X-BUSTER UPGRADE then you can charge up the ROLLING SHIELD to create a
 force field, preventing the enemies from knocking you to your death. If you
 missed that upgrade then you will have to be really careful jumping, and try
 and shoot each enemy before you jump because they keep coming back!

 Inside the base you will soon come face to face with VILE, who will then be
 chased through a boss door by ZERO. As you follow you will hear the battle
 in the room ahead, and soon discover ZERO captured by VILE who is now riding
 his Ride-Armour.

|----------------------------|
|---------| Boss |-----------| You will have to fight against his Ride-Armour
|----------------------------| first of all, and just as with your previous
|                            | meeting you will not be able to harm him (so
| Name:                 VILE | don't waste any SUB TANKS on him). After he has
| Difficulty:           Easy | given you a beating, he will paralyse you like
| Normal X Shots:         32 | before - except this time ZERO will sacrifice
| Large X Shots:           8 | himself, and the last of his power to destroy
| Weakness:   ROLLING SHIELD | VILE'S Ride-Armour. You will kindly be given a
|                   (8 Hits) | full LIFE BAR to fight him now, and this should
|        Charged SHOTGUN ICE | be enough to beat him with unless you have a
|                   (4 Hits) | short LIFE BAR or missed some of the upgrades
|----------------------------| (but don't be afraid to use a SUB TANK if you
                               need one).

 He will run or fly from left to right, pausing only to shoot yellow 
 paralysing plasma balls (which don't damage, but give him a free hit). When
 he flies overhead he drops two bombs that send sparks across the floor - but
 contact with either is pretty weak. He is sometimes unpredictable in
 movement, and very damaging to make contact with - so avoid him at all costs.

 Vault the paralysing Plasma balls he shoots, and either jump over or run
 under him as he crosses the screen. You will have a hard time avoiding the
 bombs he drops if you are close to him, but you can easily hit him at any
 point during the battle, and as long as you use charged shots then he wont
 last long.

 His weakness is the ROLLING SHIELD, although the charged-up SHOTGUN ICE
 actually kills him in just 4 hits(!!!), but you will probably have a harder
 time hitting him with it. Of course you could always just use the HADOUKEN
 UPGRADE if you can pull it off at the right time.
 
 After beating VILE, you will find ZERO close to death, and If you didn't
 obtain the X-BUSTER UPGRADE on FLAME MAMMOTH'S stage, then you will receive
 it now from ZERO before he dies. Make your way right and then up a long and
 annoying vertical section (you can make use of the charged up CHAMELEON STING
 here), and at the top you will face BOOMER KUWANGER for the second time. He
 will be a lot easier now you definitely have the HOMING TORPEDO, which you
 can now charge up for an even quicker dispatch. After these two easy bosses
 you will soon come to the real boss for this level.

|----------------------------|
|---------| Boss |-----------| You will notice the four web-track in the
|----------------------------| background that this large spider boss will
|                            | travel downwards on. Every time he pauses at
| Name:             BOSPIDER | the top of the screen, eight random connectors
| Difficulty:      Very Hard | will appear between these tracks, and which he
| Normal X Shots:         32 | will always use to switch between them. The 
| Large X Shots:          11 | trick here is work out where he will end up at
| Weakness:      SHOTGUN ICE | the bottom of the the screen so that can get a
|                  (11 Hits) | quick shot in when he opens his eye. Although
|        Charged SHOTGUN ICE | shooting him is the main objective, you will
|                   (7 Hits) | also have to judge where he will finish up so
|----------------------------| that you can avoid his damaging contact. He
                               also speeds up as you reduce his energy, and if
 he uses the outer tracks he can hit you even when you are right against the
 wall - very irritating.

 He will only open the eye for a split second before quickly retreating
 upwards, so unless you are close to him you will need to shoot just before he
 reaches the bottom. During the pause at the top, he sometimes drops four
 smaller robot spiders that are too low to hit with Normal X-Buster shots, and 
 which will walk along the floor and up the walls unless you destroy them. He
 will also stop and drop these spiders if you become level with him while he
 descends (such as you jumping or wall climbing).

 This boss can be really annoying, and sometimes always seems go the way you
 do - constantly damaging you really badly. The smaller spiders are also
 annoying to avoid, so try not to make him drop extra ones if you can help it.
 The charged up X-Buster is effective, but takes too long to recharge if you
 use it to destroy the smaller spiders. The SHOTGUN ICE is not only his
 weakness, but destroys the smaller spiders too, but you are likely to run out
 unless you can manage to hit consistently. If you ever miss your shot, then
 you will not get another chance to hit him unless you are using the X-Buster
 - so try to make them all count. Use a SUB TANK if you need one, and don't
 bother to charge up the SHOTGUN ICE - it is too difficult to get close enough
 for it to hit him. You can also use the HADOUKEN if you get lucky...


-[3.13]-------------------------SIGMA STAGE 2----------------------------------

 A short distance into this level and you will face CHILL PENGUIN for the
 second time, but you should have even less problems this time around. Shortly
 on and you fight STORM EAGLE again - also easy, but you may want to save the
 CHAMELEON STING for the real Boss. You should soon come to the boss door of
 this easier stage - but its not a particularly easy boss.

|----------------------------|
|---------| Boss |-----------| This boss consists of three different parts
|----------------------------| that must all be destroyed separately. The two
|                            | eyes can only be hit after they open - where
| Name:        RANGDA BANGDA | they will either be green, blue or red. The
|    LEFT EYE/RIGHT EYE/NOSE | green eye shoots 1 bullet, the blue one will
| Difficulty:   Intermediate | fly towards you, and the red one can do both
| Normal X Shots:   10/10/12 | and fire 3 bullets. The bottom of the screen
| Large X Shots:       5/5/6 | has instant death spikes in the middle, and
| Weakness:  CHAMELEON STING | every so often the walls will close together
|               (4/4/4 Hits) | and the nose will come to life - so you need
|                            | to cling on to the wall and watch out for it
|----------------------------| knocking you onto them. It will repeat this
                               over and over unless you either destroy the
 nose, or both of the eyes - in which case the walls will close in for good,
 and you will have to destroy the rest while desperately clinging on the wall.

 Not too difficult as long as you can competently remain on the walls when
 they close together. By using the CHAMELEON STING you can destroy all three
 parts quite easily, but if you used it up earlier then you will have to hang
 on for slightly longer. The best tactic either way is to hit all three in
 equal measures - just to make sure the last part when you have to remain on
 the wall indefinitely, is as short as possible.


-[3.14]-------------------------SIGMA STAGE 3----------------------------------

 This level is basically the rematch against all the remaining MAVERICKS.
 Right at the Start you will have to fight ARMORED ARMADILLO before coming up
 against STING CHAMELEON again. SPARK MANDRILL, LAUNCH OCTOPUS, and finally
 FLAME MAMMOTH completes the order, but you really shouldn't be having trouble
 against them this time around. Just use the correct weapon for each, charging
 it up for a quicker kill (but you may want to save the BOOMERANG CUTTER for
 the proper boss of this level) - or even using the HADOUKEN if you have full
 energy.

 When you leave the water after beating LAUNCH OCTOPUS but before FLAME
 MAMMOTH, you will see a platform of instant death spikes above you which
 holds a large energy capsule, a large weapon capsule, and an Extra Life.
 Simply charge up the CHAMELEON STING and run across the spikes to get all
 three items - and if you are quick you can even make it to the boss door
 while still invincible, thus evading the many enemies outside.

|----------------------------|
|---------| Boss |-----------| A very strange looking boss that is in two
|----------------------------| separate parts, but only the top one will take
|                            | damage. It will split up and the two parts
| Name:                D-REX | will move independently across the screen, with
| Difficulty:           Hard | the bottom half knocking you off any wall by
| Normal X Shots:         32 | crashing against either - very annoying. The
| Large X Shots:          16 | bottom part can only actually damage you by
| Weakness: BOOMERANG CUTTER | crushing you against the wall, so you can
|                  (11 Hits) | stand on it to avoid its charge, but watch out
|   Charged BOOMERANG CUTTER | for the top half trying to crush you when you
|                   (8 Hits) | do. Both parts will occasionally pause on the
|----------------------------| right side of the screen before charging up
                               and then firing a huge plasma ball, which is
 best avoided by being in the top left corner and jumping forward when it
 fires - this is its most damaging attack.

 You will have to be quick to avoid contact with this unpredictable boss, who
 will speed up as its energy decreases. Dash jump between the two halves -
 towards the right when it comes towards you, and back to the left as it
 returns. It is risky to shoot while both parts are moving because you might
 be knocked off the wall you need to jump from (and then stunned), so try to
 hit it with charged shots while it is charging up the plasma ball. You will
 almost certainly need a SUB TANK if you are relying on the X-Buster, but you
 can fill them up to the max easily on the final level.

 If you are using the BOOMERANG CUTTER then you just need to watch out for the
 bottom half of the boss, which will simply cancel the boomerangs on contact.


-[3.15]-------------------------SIGMA STAGE 4----------------------------------

 You just need to climb upwards to finally face SIGMA, but first charge up the
 ROLLING SHIELD, and destroy the caterpillars that emerge from the holes in
 the wall to fill your SUB TANKS. With everything full, make your way to the
 top - and the start of a sequence of battles that will give you nightmares?

|----------------------------|
|---------| Boss |-----------| SIGMA will teleport into the arena and give you
|----------------------------| the usual bad-guy speech before setting his pet
|                            | dog onto you. It is not a hard battle, and
| Name:            VELGUADER | possible to do without getting hit - but you
| Difficulty:           Easy | should aim for at least half a LIFE BAR
| Normal X Shots:         32 | remaining. SIGMA'S PET is quite agile, and can
| Large X Shots:          11 | leap towards you from distance (which he will
| Weakness:      SHOTGUN ICE | always do at the start - so don't move 
|                  (11 Hits) | forward!). He can also jump from the walls as
|        Charged SHOTGUN ICE | well, and if you are hiding high up one, then
|                   (8 Hits) | he can vault from wall you wall to reach you.
|----------------------------| His final attack is to stop and breath either a
                               stream of fire or balls of ice - both deadly in
 their own right. The ice will spray in a rainbow arc, and is very hard to
 avoid when standing on the floor, but it cannot reach you high up the walls.
 The fire shoots in an upwards arc, and can hit you high up the walls at
 distance, he can also sneakily fire it vertically if he is right below you.

 His biggest weakness is the push-back effect from either the yellow or pink
 X-Buster charged shots. So if you constantly charge and hide up the walls,
 you can knock him back to the ground every time with a well timed charged
 shot. He will probably do the vertical fire move at least once, so you need
 to jump across the arena and quickly up the other wall if he does - then
 repeat. You can use this weakness successfully from the ground too if you
 cannot bear to hide like a coward, just move from side to side, quickly
 jumping over him by using the walls. And remember to try the HADOUKEN UPGRADE
 right at the start.

 Because the SHOTGUN ICE shatters into smaller shots when it hits the wall,
 you can fire it while hiding high up and hit him while he is on the ground.
 Unfortunately it doesn't push him back after a hit so it cannot prevent him
 from chasing you up the walls - and therefore it's not as useful as the
 charged X-Buster.
 
|----------------------------|
|---------| Boss |-----------| After a second speech, SIGMA ditches his cloak
|----------------------------| and faces you himself - with his light Sabre!
|                            | Using his Light Sabre he can block anything you
| Name:                SIGMA | throw at him, including the HADOUKEN UPGRADE.
| Difficulty:   Intermediate | His main method of attack is to simply zig-zag
| Normal X Shots:         32 | from wall to wall climbing up the screen - done
| Large X Shots:          32 | to chase you if you hide in the top corners
| Weakness:   ELECTRIC SPARK | (which is where you should be). He will damage
|                  (16 Hits) | you most often simply by crashing into you, but
|     Charged ELECTRIC SPARK | while you are on the floor he has two other
|                  (11 Hits) | attacks. He sometimes shoots fast laser shots
|----------------------------| from his forehead, which are hard to avoid from
                               close range, but not much threat at distance.
 His final attack is to shoot forward and slash you with his light sabre -
 taking off almost a quarter of the maximum LIFE BAR, but you should see it
 coming unless you are really close (which you shouldn't ever be).

 He doesn't really have a pattern, but by staying high up the walls he will
 always zig-zag up and down the screen - over and over. Just wait in a top
 corner until he is just below you, then prepare to jump down and shoot him as
 you fall. He will then zig-zag down, so you need to judge and then dash away
 from where he will land - and then get in another shot before climbing up
 again. You can sometimes get him into a (kind of) pattern, where you can
 safely remain in the same place whenever you fall - but this is risky because
 he will eventually come out of it. You can also use the HADOUKEN UPGRADE, but
 unless you have full energy, don't waste a SUB TANK.

 He takes too many regular hits, and so you should always use the ELECTRIC
 SPARK against him. The ELECTRIC SPARK splits into two when it hits a wall,
 which is really useful for hitting him while he climbs them. The ELECTRIC
 SPARK is a rapid fire weapon, and easy to get carried away with - so unless
 you time your shots right then you are almost certain to run out of it during
 the battle. Just try to get his energy down significantly before you are
 forced to use something else (use anything else except the ROLLING SHIELD)
 - try the charged CHAMELEON STING (temporary invincible) for the safest time,
 and its worth noting that the HOMING TORPEDO will not home onto him.

 You should ultimately aim not to use any SUB TANKS on either of these battles
 because the final boss is very tough, and drains energy at a frightening
 rate.

|----------------------------|
|---------| Boss |-----------| SIGMA'S head will rise and attach itself onto 
|----------------------------| the head of a giant machine that appears in the 
|                            | background. He is so high up that the only way 
| Name:          FINAL SIGMA | to hit him is to stand on either of his two 
| Difficulty: Very Very Hard | moving claws which unfortunately shoot 
| Normal X Shots:         NA | lightning out of their top and bottom. This
| Large X Shots:   (PINK) 32 | lighting is very damaging, as is contact with
| Weakness:   ROLLING SHIELD | the spikes underneath the claws - which he will 
|                  (16 Hits) | occasionally send downwards to hit you. His 
|                            | other move is to breath fast laser beams, which 
|----------------------------| will sweep either left or right, but can be 
                               avoided by dashing through when they get close.
 His final move is to breath fire, but will miss if you are standing against
 either wall. All these moves are very damaging, and take skill to avoid - so
 you will probably need "at least" 3 SUB TANKS to defeat him, which you should
 use whenever you fall below half energy.

 You should try to get onto one of the claws as early as possible rather than
 wait for him to send one down. Just do all you can to remain on it for as
 long as possible, and hit him at every opportunity. Stand on its very edge or
 try jumping onto the wall when it shoots lighting upwards, and also watch out
 for the other claw occasionally moving across. Whenever you jump always try
 to land back onto the claw - this is very tough in its own right, but from up
 here you will avoid the laser and fire it breathes. You will need to jump to
 fire the ROLLING SHIELD into his head, but you can hit him with the largest
 charged X-BUSTER shot (pink energy) just by remaining standing (it takes a
 long time to charge this remember).

 There is not really much more advice to give, but with practice and luck you
 will beat him, and finish the game...

 When the credits finish, wait for a few moments to see a message from SIGMA -
 he will be back!
