<P>„Shut Up!!‰  Bardock yelled to his servant.  Bardock throws his cup he was holding at his general.  „I don‚t 
care if Planet Yudo can‚t be occupied till later!‰  The general bows and knees down to the floor.  „Sire, 
Commander Vageta, ordered us to not make any actions till the full moon.‰  Bardock angrily slams his fist 
on his throne chair.  „Dang‰  (Since when does a commander‚s order take over a king‚s order)  He thought. 
„Fine, wait until the full moon.  Then Planet Yudo is ours.‰  Just then a pink, small character pops out from 
the shadows, covered in Sayjin armor.  „Lord Buu!!‰  Bardock yelled, sounding surprised.  „Why hello, 
King Bardock.  How is the Planet Yudo Operation going?‰ He asked questionably.  „Well‰, said Bardock, 
nervously, „We will have to wait till the full moon is out due to the high concentrate of power there.‰  As 
Bardock announced the Yudo Operation, he stood and bowed to Lord Buu.  „Why wait so long?‰  He 
sounded awful annoyed ,which isn‚t good.  „Sir, it‚s just 3 extra days.‰  He stammered.  „Do you need my 
men to interfere?  They can easily handle the job.  Even my rookies could handle this job.‰  Buu asked.  
Bardock waves his hand no.  „Sire, our men can take control of Planet Yudo, you have my word.‰  Lord 
Buu then looks up at Bardock.  „When shall I pick up Prince Kakoratte?‰  Bardock then narrows his eyes 
and grits his teeth.  „Pick him up tomorrow!‰  Buu jokefully says  „That‚s a date.‰  He softly knocks 
Bardock in the arm and leaves.  Bardock holds where Lord Buu punch him to show it hurt.  „Are we going 
to give up Prince Kakoratte?‰  Questioned his right-hand man, Lord Tora.  „I‚d rather give up Planet Sayja 
then give him the prince!!‰  Bardock, angrily yelled.  „Sire‰  Said Lord Tora.  We then see a battle field and 
we see a man with tall hair and beard on the ground, bloody with two beings kicking him.  „Ugh!!!‰  
Grunted the man.  „Why don‚t you die, Vageta.  It‚s no hope.  You are weak, while we are strong!!‰  Stated 
the man with black hair and Sayjin armor.  „Should we just blast him.  Lord Buu will destroy Planet Sayja 
within the hour.  I don‚t want to be late for the fireworks.‰  Commented the girl with blond hair and Sayjin 
armor.  „What∑.do∑.you∑.mean?!?!‰  Vageta asked weakly.  The man with the black hair turned to him.  
„Lord Buu is planning on destroying the Sayjin race of course.‰  Vageta‚s eyes widen and he attempts to 
get up, but instead to be beat down by the pair.  Vageta isn‚t moving or showing any signs of life.  Just 
then, the man with black hair‚s scouter beeped.  „Come in Sergeant 17 and 18, Lord Buu request you meet 
with him immediately!!‰  17 looks at 18.  „Vageta‚s dead.  Let‚s go.‰  The two fly off and we see Vageta 
struggling to get up.  Vageta gets up and weakly says „At least my son is alive, he was sent to the Planet 
Earth.‰  His eyes roll to the back of his head and he dies.   

<H3 align=center>-Chapter 1-</H3>

<P>Twenty years have passed and we see a car.  The man driving has a suit and tie, with large black hair.  With 
him is a women with shoulder-length blue hair, a green dress, and with them is a boy with light-purple hair 
and a neatly tucked in shirt with khaki pants.  „When will Gokou, Chi-Chi, and Goten arrive?‰  Asked the 
women to the man next to him.  „Gokou said about nineish.‰  Answered the man.  „This is so cool we could 
all get together with the rest of the gang at King Kai‚s Island.‰  The women said gleefully and the man 
nodded.  (I wish I didn‚t have to come) The boy thought.  We then see a home with and a man, with a suit 
and tie, and unique black hair carrying presents to the car, a women with black hair tied in a bun and a long 
dress, and a boy with the same unique hair style with a coat and khaki pants.  „Chi-Chi, were do you want 
these presents to go?‰  The man asked.  „Put them in the trunk of the car, Gokou‰  Chi-Chi answered.  Just 
then, the women felt a tug at the end of her dress, and the little boy was there.  „What do you want, Goten?‰  
Chi-Chi asked.  „Where are we going?‰  He asked.  Gokou walks up and puts his hand on top of Goten‚s 
head.  „We‚re going to a old friend of ours named King Kai.‰  Gokou informed Goten.  Goten thought for a 
minute and then asked „Will food and Trunks be there?‰  He asked thoughtfully.  „Vageta and his family is 
probably there already and there will be lots of food, Goten.‰  Gokou answered to Goten.  Goten gets all 
excited.  „YIPPEE!!!!‰  Goten starts running to the car.  We then see outer space and a two pods shooting 
towards Earth.  Inside pod number two is a man with a scouter, Sayjin armor, and hair just like Gokou‚s.  
Inside pod number 2 is a man with a scouter, Sayjin armor, and long thick black hair.  They rush towards 
Earth.  We then see a small house on a island in the middle of the sea with party balloons.  In it, we see a 
man with three eyes, a small, little guy with white skin and red patches on his face, a man with two scars 
and long thick black  hair, a guy with long, blond hair and muscular, and a green, pointy eared guy with a 
turban standing in the corner.  In the middle of a few is a small, pudgy insect-,man thing with shades and 
two antenna, cracking jokes.  „Then the man said .  That‚s not my wife, it‚s my pet Salamander!!!‰  The 
person laughs hysterically while the others hang in utter silence while the green guy turns away in disgust.  
All of a sudden, there‚s a loud knock at the door.  „Come in!!‰  The man with antenna cheerfully answered.  
The door opens and the guy we saw with large black hair, suit and tie and his family.  „Vageta and Bulma.  
Nice to see you guys again!!‰  The man said happily.  He then notices the small boy near Bulma‚s knee.  
(What is this insect guy.  I think I should stomp on it)  Thought the small boy.  „And who do we have 
here?‰  Said the bug-guy.  „My names King Kai‰,  stretches his arm, „Put it here!‰  The boy takes King 
Kai‚s hand and shakes it, throwing King Kai on the floor, hard.  Vageta, seeing this scene, starts laughing.  
„Finally, King Kai made a joke!!‰  He pats his son on the head.  „My son, Trunks, is too strong for his own 
good.‰  The place erupts with laughter.  Vageta and Bulma mingle a little, talking to some of the people in 
the room.  (Is this place a circus or what?)  Trunks thinks.  He then sees Piccolo and can‚t help but stare.  
Piccolo notices Trunks staring at him and smiles.  Just then, another knocking at the door and King Kai 
comes to the door and opens it.  Gokou, Chi-Chi, and Goten arrive at the house.  „Gokou, Chi-Chi.  So glad 
to see you again!!‰  King Kai shouted.  He looks at Goten and looks up at Gokou and Chi-Chi.  „You too?‰  
He asked.  „What do you mean, King Kai?‰  Gokou asked.  „What I mean is‰, touching his two fingers 
together, „You both a have a son.‰  Gokou is surprised.  „Uh∑yeah.‰  Gokou looks at Trunks.  „Oh, you 
meet Trunks?‰  King Kai holds up his red, throbbing hand without explanation.  Just then.  „Hey Gokou!!‰  
Came a high-pitched voice.  Gokou turns his head.  „Krillen!!‰  A bald headed, small man walks up to 
Gokou and shakes his hand.  „How‚s it going, Gokou?‰  Gokou shakes his.  „Fine Krillen.  And you?‰
„I‚m doing o.k.  I guess.‰  Krillen answered back to Gokou.  Everyone is talking until they feel a little 
shake.  „What was that?‰  Everyone was asking.  We then see the two pods made contact with Earth.  
„What the heck was that?‰ The policemen in the police car asked as they turned around and headed for the 
sound.  Two big impact craters were formed from the pods and smoke rises up from the crater.  The police 
car stops right next to the crater and the police men carefully and nervously get out to investigate.  „Is this 
one of them „space junk‰?‰  The officer asked nervously.  „I have no idea Officer Bob.  Whatever it 
is∑..it‚s not from around here!‰  Said the other officer.  Suddenly, light begins to flow from the ship and 
the hatches open.  The officers men show true terror as two figures emerge from the pods and walk onto 
Earth‚s soil.  „Be∑..ready∑.(gulp)∑.Officer Bob!!‰  The police men said.  „Yea∑..I will∑∑Officer 
Mike‰  Officer Bob said.  We can see the faces of the beings and one has hair resembling Gokou‚s while 
the other has long, thick black hair.  „FREEZE!!!!!‰  Officer Mike boldly announced.  „We have you 
surrounded!!‰  Just then Officer Bob fled but only to be taken down by a small energy beam type attack 
that the thick haired man shot from his palms.  „Officer Bob!!‰  Officer Mike yelled.  He raises his gun to 
the two men and fires two shots at both but the two just catch the bullets with his two fingers, chop-stick 
style.  „Excuse me.  Is this yours?‰  The thick-haired man calmly asked.  „Do you want it back?‰  The man 
with Gokou‚s hair politely asked.  At that moment, the two fling their hands and we see the officer fly back 
into the car and the car is exploded.  The man is limp and the car is in ashes.  Their high-tech eye-patches 
bleep and show some numbers and arrows.  „From what I see, Turlis, I sense 5 more then normal 
powerlevels.  Clearly over the 300‚s range.‰  The thick haired man said.  „No doubt that one is Kakoratte 
and one is Vageta.  There are others but they are not to worry about.‰  Turlis announced.  The two fly off in 
that direction.  The scene cuts back to King Island and the cheerful mood turns to a stale mood.  Gokou 
turns to Vageta.  „Hey Vageta, should we go investigate what that was?‰  Gokou asked.  Vageta answered 
with a nod and they took off.  Piccolo, the green guy, Krillen, Yamcha, the man with long hair and scars, 
Olibu, the blond hair man, and Tien, three ˆeyed man take off to.  „C-mon Trunks!!‰  Goten yelled and he 
quickly powers-up.  Trunks does the following and they take off before Bulma and Chi-Chi can catch them.  
„If you don‚t get back her mister.  You will be grounded for a whole month.  You here me!!!!‰  Chi-chi 
angrily yelled and Goten.  „Chi-chi, they are out of hearing range already.‰  Bulma told Chi-chi and Chi-chi 
could only look up and stare  We then see Gokou and Vageta in the lead with Piccolo, Krillen, Tien, and 
Yamcha following and Goten and Trunks in the way distance.  „Hey Vageta, what do you think that was?‰  
Gokou asked Vageta while looking forward.  „Have no idea, Gokou.‰  Vageta pauses to think.  „I can feel 
their power, there‚s two.  A evil dark power but one I faintly remember.‰  Vageta takes another pause.  
„Like in a dream.‰  Gokou nods his head.  „I feel like I do to know this power.‰  They rush with the others 
closely following.  We see a green view of the scouter and yellow numbers and letters of a different 
language.  „Raditz, they are coming this way.‰  Turlis answered nervously.  „Sure they outnumber us in 
people but we are clearly more powerful then any of them, Turlis.‰  Raditz assured Turlis.  (I‚ve been 
looking forward of finding you brother.  Vageta, last time I saw you was when you were a young baby.  
The day before I was sent by dad∑.and before he died.)  Raditz thought.  „Hey Raditz, I‚m itching to face 
my brother Kakoratte, let‚s go!!‰  Turlis asked his comrade.  „Same here.  Let‚s go.‰  The two power-up 
and have white-aura circling around them.  They then take off with great speeds.  We then see Gokou, 
Vageta, and the others racing until Gokou and Vageta stop suddenly.  The 4 others go up to where they are 
standing.  „Hey Gokou, why are you standing here?‰  Krillen asked.  Gokou turns to Krillen.  „Vageta and I 
have been sensing a evil, dark power right when it landed.  The two great powers are coming right at us at 
great speeds!‰  Gokou informed Krillen, still looking straight.  Goten and Trunks stop to keep a safe 
distance so they won‚t be discovered.  „Hey Trunks, why did they just stop?‰  Goten asked.  „Beats me, 
Goten.‰  Trunks answered Goten but knew very well something was up.  Just then before Gokou and 
company.  The two mysterious fighters stopped right in front of them and stared at them.  „I‚ve felt your 
power before.‰  Gokou calmly commented.  „Who∑.who are you guys?‰  The two evilly smiled.  Turlis 
looked at Gokou. „I‚m Turlis.  I‚m your big brother, Kakoratte.‰  Gokou‚s mouth dropped and he was 
shocked.  Raditz looked at Vageta.  „I‚m Raditz.  I‚m too your big brother, Vageta‰  Vageta gritted his 
teeth and looked mad.  We then see the four of then staring at each other.  

<P>This is the end of Dragon Ball XL:  Chapter 1.  Chapter 1 is part of the Sayjin Saga.  All characters were 
not created by me but the creators of the Dragon Ball series.  I do take credit for the plot of Dragon Ball XL 
and the development.  I did take the idea of this story by William Proctor .  Author of Another Dimension 
but twisted the idea a little.

- Chapter 2 -</H3>

<P>„Last time on Dragon Ball XL:  Chapter 1.  Gokou, Vageta, and friends get a rude awakening when they 
find two very powerful beings they have visited the world.  There whereabouts were unknown until they 
announced they are brothers of our heroes, Gokou and Vageta.  What will be the outcome of this?‰

<P>„Yeah. that‚s right.‰  Raditz points to him and Turlis.  „We are your big brothers!‰  Vageta raises his fists 
and becomes angry.  „Yeah, right!!   I don‚t even remember you!!‰  Vageta is about to lose his temper.  
„Vageta, have you forgotten your mission?‰  Vageta is surprised and calm down.  „What mission?  I don‚t 
remember any mission.‰  Raditz ponders on this thought until Turlis speaks up.  „Hey Raditz, maybe 
Vageta lost his memory or something.‰  Turlis returns to Gokou.  „Kakoratte, does this make any sense to 
you?‰  Gokou scratches his head and looks surprised.  „This is all new to me.‰  Raditz gets all mad.  
„Great!!  The prince of Planet Sayja and 1st class warrior, Vageta Senior‚s son lost their memories.‰  Gokou 
looks at them.  „Say what?‰  Raditz looks at Gokou.  „You and Turlis are both royalty.  Your father, King 
Bardock was king of the Planet Sayja.  Vageta and you are a warrior race called the Sayjins.‰  Turlis then 
looks over Gokou‚s head and sees Goten and Trunks.  „I‚m guessing those are yours and Vegeta‚s 
children.‰  Vageta and Gokou quickly turn around and finally notice them.  „TRUNKS!!!!!  RUN AWAY 
AS FA∑∑∑!!!!!‰  Vageta yells at trunks but Raditz knees Vageta in the stomach without anyone 
knowing.  „DAD!!!!!!‰  Trunks yells and powers up.  Vageta is slowly floating down and then Raditz gives 
him a two handed fist slam into the back sending him into the salty water below.  „VAGETA!!!!!‰  Gokou 
yells and he turns around and stares coldly at Turlis and Raditz.  „You guys aren‚t our brothers.  You guys 
are bullies.  Thugs!!‰  Gokou charges at them and Turlis dodges Gokou‚s punch and kicks him into the 
stomach and sends Gokou flying way up.  Turlis them appears above Gokou and punches Gokou in the face 
sending him into a near-by island.  By then Raditz came back up with a near-dead Vageta and Turlis 
appears with a near-dead Gokou.  „Vageta, Kakoratte.  We will be taking your sons.  If you want them 
back, destroy half of Planet Earth‚s inhabitants within the next two hours or we will kill your sons and 
destroy this miserable dust ball of a planet.‰  Raditz told them evilly.  „Goten∑∑.‰  Gokou barely 
managed to say.  Raditz and turlis throws Vageta and Gokou to Piccolo and Yamcha and they quickly 
disappear to Goten and Trunks and disappear again.  Krillen rushes to them with Senzui beans.  „Here 
Gokou, take this.‰  Krillen pushes a Senzui bean into Gokou‚s mouth and Gokou swallows it.  He then 
gives one to Vageta and they both awaken, renewed and 100% healed.  „Ahhhh∑ This feels better!!‰  
Gokou said while twirling his arm around, cracking it.  „Gokou, what should we do about this?  They have 
both of our sons and I don‚t want to destroy half of the inhabitants.‰  Vageta asked Gokou.  „I don‚t either.  
You and me alone can‚t defeat Raditz and Turlis.  The two strongest should come with us.  Piccolo and 
Olibu.  Come with us.‰  Gokou said.  „Can you, Vageta, Olibu, and Me beat those guys?‰  Asked Piccolo.  
„I‚m not sure.‰  Gokou answered.  „Well.  I want Trunks back so lets go!!‰  Vageta yelled and he powered 
up and so did Gokou, Piccolo, and Olibu.  „There they go.‰  Krillen said.  We see Gokou, Vageta, Piccolo, 
and Olibu flying towards the two men who have their sons.  (GOKOU!!!)  Came a voice inside Gokou‚s 
mind.  (Yeah King Kai?)  Answered Gokou.  (Just wanted to see how you are doing and I bet your 
wondering what all this means.)  King Kai said,  (This is all to confusing.  Do you know about it King 
Kai?)  Asked Gokou.  (As a matter of fact I do.  I knew you and Vageta‚s grandfather.  The person who 
took care of you guys.  Here‚s what happened.  Vageta came to Earth as a small child inside a metal like 
pod.  Grandpa Gotenks found Vageta when Vageta landed and adopted him.  Two days later, another ship 
can crashing to earth and contained another small child which was you and showed a crown, telling your 
royalty.  Grandpa Gotenks then called you Gokou.  Vageta‚s name was readable but yours wasn‚t for some 
odd reason.  You two were a handful and you two always fought, always rivaled until you two knocked 
each other in the head so hard.  You gave yourselves amnesia and forgot your mission that Raditz and 
Turlis is telling you about.)  Explained King Kai.  (Oh,  I see now.)  Gokou replied.  (Hey Vageta, getting 
all this?)  Gokou though to Vageta.  (It‚s all clear to me now.)  Thought Vageta.  (Vageta!!  You were 
listening?!?)  Thought-yelled King Kai.  (Ha, Ha Ha, Ha.  Is this some kind of private conversation.  I 
deserved to know that.)  Vageta thought.  (I guess so)  Thought King Kai.  (We are getting near Raditz and 
Turlis, King Kai.  I have to hang up now.)  Though Gokou.  (Good luck Gokou and Vageta.  Come back 
alive.)  Though king Kai.  (We will)  Vageta thought.  (We promise)  Gokou added.  Vageta and Gokou 
nod at each other and flew faster with Piccolo and Olibu following them.  We see Raditz and Turlis sitting 
in a clearing with Trunks and Goten in there spaceships, crying and throwing fits.   „Beep, Beep, Beep‰  
The scouter sounded and Raditz and Turlis narrowed there eyes to the scouters numbers.  „What the heck.  
Is this blasted thing going haywire?‰  Asked Turlis, quite angry at the gadget.  „It must be broken.‰  Raditz 
replied.  They both turned there scouters on snooze.  „Hey Turlis, go look at the kids.‰  Commanded 
Raditz.  „Yeah. Sure‰  Grumbled Turlis and he floated over there and looked at the pods and floated down 
looking into the pod where Trunks is.  „Hey kid, don‚t worry.  You have an hour left before you die.  We 
haven‚t sensed any power fading yet.‰  Trunks started yelling at Turlis and pounding the glass.  Turlis then 
goes to Goten‚s pod and peers in.  „Hey fella, you have an hour to go before you die.  If your father doesn‚t 
obeys us.‰  Turlis teased.  „MY FATHER WILL COME TO SAVE ME AND DESTROY YOU GUYS!!!‰  
Goten yelled, cracking some of the glass.  „Whoa.  Kid, settle down.  Your father wouldn‚t dare think come 
to save you guys.  If he did, he will die.‰  Turlis told Goten.  Turlis then floated out of the crater and joined 
Raditz.  „Well?‰  Raditz asked.  „Throwing fits as usual.‰  Turlis told him.  „I can‚t be believe Vageta and 
Kakoratte didn‚t train these kids right.  They are Sayjins.  Warriors.  They‚re acting like babies.‰  
Grumbled Raditz.  Just then, Turlis and Raditz‚s scouters bleeped and showed numbers.  „Darn it, these 
things are broken!!‰  Raditz said with a annoyed sounding in his voice.  He took of his scouter and fried it 
with a energy beam and so did Turlis.  We see the group flying.  „Gokou, what‚s the plan?‰  Olibu asked 
Gokou.  „I‚m not sure Olibu.  I was thinking, since they have those scouters, we attack at 4 different sides.‰  
Gokou answered.  „I think that sounds like a plan.‰  Vageta announced.  They all then split up in 4 different 
sides.  Raditz and turlis show up again.  „Hey Raditz, what is Vageta and Kakoratte do decide to try to 
rescue their sons?‰  Asked Turlis.  „It would be a foolish act on there part and it would mean certain death.‰  
Raditz answered Turlis.  Just then a bright light fills the area and 4 energy beams collide at Raditz and 
Turlis.  „What the∑∑.!!!!‰  Raditz shouted.  „AHHHHHH∑∑..!!!!‰  Turlis yelled.  The 4 energy beams 
collide together creating a ground shattering explosion.  Gokou, Vageta, Olibu, and Piccolo come together 
above the blast.  „We did it, Gokou!!‰  Olibu shouted.  „Wait∑‰  Gokou said.  As the dust settled, there 
stood Raditz and Turlis, with just a few scratches.  „What!!  We gave it all we got.‰  Piccolo yelled in 
anguish.  „Is that you got.  Huh?‰  Asked Raditz.  Gokou then came flying down and tried to punch Turlis, 
but Turlis dodged the punch and punched Gokou in the face sending him 50 feet away.  Vageta then tried to 
kick Raditz but Raditz held out his arm to block the kick, then uppercuts Vageta in the jaw sending him 
several feet in the air.  Piccolo and Olibu rush towards Gokou and Vageta but Raditz grabs Olibu‚s leg and 
slams him into the ground and Turlis kicks Piccolo‚s back, sending him into the dirt.  Gokou then comes 
racing towards Turlis and punches Turlis hard in the face sending Turlis into a tree, breaking it into a 
million pieces.  Raditz then looks up and Vageta lands a two-foot smash in Raditz‚s face and smashes 
Raditz into the dirt.  Gokou then fires a Kamehameha at Turlis and Vageta sends a Kamehameha at Raditz.  
„Do you think we got them?‰  Vageta asked Gokou.  „Sorry Vageta but I‚m not sure.‰  Soon enough, Turlis 
and Raditz slowly gets up, bruised, beaten, and bloody.  Just then Olibu flies at Raditz and kicks him hard 
in the gut sending Raditz into the air and Olibu shoots a energy blast at Raditz sending him into the ground.  
Piccolo uses his Mystic Attack and grabs Turlis and slams him into a large rock, crushing it, and throws 
him high into the air.  Piccolo then shoots a Masenko-Ha at Turlis and Turlis crashes head first into the 
ground.  Piccolo and Olibu lands next to Gokou and Vageta and waits out it out.  Raditz and Turlis‚s bodies 
lay there for about a minute.  „Did we get them?‰  Asked Piccolo.  Just then Raditz and Turlis jump up 
really fast and both outstretch their arms and cup there hands and straighten out their fingers.  „Hyper 
Destruction Blast!!!!‰  A rainbow colored blast comes charging at our heroes.  A quick flash and we see the 
blast collide into the mountain, exploding it.  In front of Gokou, Vageta, Piccolo, and Olibu is Goten and 
Trunks, enraged.  „T∑T∑T∑Trunks?‰  Vageta stammered.  „Goten?‰  Was all Gokou could say.  The 
two children then flew at Raditz and Turlis and punched them in the gut and both fired a ki blast in there 
faces.  Then they charged at Turlis and Raditz and headbutted them in the chest, cracking there armor.  
Turlis and Raditz then picked them up and formed a energy blast but them Gokou and Vageta went behind 
them and grabbed there tails.  „AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!‰  Turlis cried out in pain and same with Raditz.  
„Vageta,  I (grunt) think we should (grunt) self-destruct.‰  Gokou told Vageta.  „It‚s the (grunt) only way.
„What!!!‰  Turlis and Raditz both yell and struggled to escape.  Gokou and Vageta then let go of their tails 
and quickly grab them around the sides.  Vageta and Gokou then start to glow and sparkle.  
„KAKORATTE!!!!‰  Turlis shouted in terror.  „VAGETA!!!!!!!‰  Raditz shouted in terror too.  „Bye 
Vageta‰  Gokou says weakly.  „Bye Gokou‰  Vageta weakly answers.  Vageta and Gokou then explode and 
catapults Turlis and Raditz high in the air.  „Grab the kids!!!‰  Piccolo yells. Olibu and Piccolo rushes and 
saves Trunks and Goten, and then shields themselves and the children.  After the shockwave, dust settles 
and Gokou and Vageta have disintegrated.  Piccolo and Olibu look up and see Raditz and Turlis come 
falling down and hit the ground, hard, really hard.  „Are they dead?‰  Piccolo asked and Olibu shrugged.  
They walked over there to check.  Piccolo shakes Raditz‚s arm and Raditz‚s eyes open.  „Your not 
dead?!?!?‰  Raditz then weakly smiles.  „Not yet.  You think you have gotten rid of us?  There will be two 
more powerful Sayjins on there way!‰  Raditz weakly tells them.  „Nappa and Brolly.  They are far stronger 
then us.  Your battle was all for not.‰  Turlis weakly commented.  „Ha.  We can just revive Gokou and 
Vageta with the dragon balls.‰  Piccolo informed them.  „Dragon what?‰  Raditz asked confusingly.  
„Dragon Balls.  I magical ball that can grant any wish that‚s within the power of the Internal Dragon.‰  
Olibu informed Raditz.  „I see.‰  Raditz said.  „Getting all that?‰  Raditz asked someone else.  „What!?‰  
Piccolo asked Raditz.  „We both have a secret headphone recorder gadget in our ears and the people on the 
other line know what you said.‰  Turlis said.  Just then the life drained out from Turlis and Raditz and they 
died.  
„Dang!!‰  Piccolo said and fell to the ground and slammed his fist.  Olibu came up and placed his hands on 
his shoulders.  „We can beat them.‰  Olibu assured Piccolo.  „And how is that?  Huh?!?  Two pair of 
Sayjins, stronger then Raditz and Turlis, are on their way to collect the dragon balls.‰  Piccolo yelled 
angrily.  „We have these guys.‰  Olibu told Piccolo and lifted Goten and Trunks up.  Piccolo then has a 
flash-back of Trunks and Goten saving them.  „They have hidden powers that if awaken, could be the 
strongest fighters in the universe.‰  Piccolo said to Olibu.  Olibu nodded to Piccolo.  „Yeah.‰  Just then a 
hover copter comes into view containing King Kai, Bulma, Chi-Chi, Krillen, Tien, Yamcha, Choazu, 
Gregory, the grasshopper, and Bubbles, the monkey.  „Well, well.‰  Piccolo commented.

<P>„Last time on Dragon Ball X:  Chapter 2.  What a noble sacrifice Gokou and Vageta made to save Planet 
Earth. Gokou and Vageta meet their brothers and after  a quick scuffle, Turlis and Raditz takes young 
Goten and Trunks.  Gokou and Vageta can have them back if they destroy half of earth‚s population by an 
hour.  Gokou, Vageta, Piccolo, and Olibu go off to rescue them.  During the fight, we see Goten and 
Trunks enraged at their fathers beatings and badly injure Raditz and Turlis.  Gokou and Vageta then self-
destruct and die but Turlis and Raditz still live but will die.  They say two new Sayjins will come:  Nappa 
and Brolly.‰

<P>„Oh no!‰  King Kai exclaimed as they neared the battle field and couldn‚t see Gokou nor Vageta.  As soon 
the plane landed, Bulma and Chi-Chi runs at Goten and Trunks giving them hugs and kisses.  „Goten, I‚m 
so glad your alive!!‰  Chi-Chi said.  „I thought you were gone for ever, Trunks!!‰  Bulma exclaimed.  Chi-
Chi and Bulma then looked around for Gokou and Vageta.  „Where‚s Gokou and Vageta?‰  Asked Chi-Chi.  
Piccolo then stepped forward.  „Chi-Chi, Bulma.  Gokou and Vageta sacrificed themselves to save Planet 
Earth.  They self-destructed and killed their evil brothers:  Turlis and Raditz.  „Oh‰  Was all Bulma and 
Chi-Chi could say and their eyes rolled to the back of their heads and fainted.  „Gokou‰  Krillen muttered.  
Piccolo then stood forward with Olibu.  „Within a year, two new Sayjins will becoming to Earth to collect 
the Dragon Balls.  After that, they will most likely destroy Earth.  We must all train very hard for these 
upcoming Sayjins because Raditz and Turlis said.  During the battle, Olibu and I noticed that Goten and 
Trunks have a mysterious power and once awaken, they could be the strongest fighters in the universe.  I 
will be training Goten and Olibu will train Trunks.‰  Piccolo calmly explained.  By this time, Chi-Chi and 
Bulma have awakened.  „WHAT!!!‰  Chi-Chi yelled angrily.  „YOU WILL NOT BE TAKING MY SON 
TO FIGHT!!!!‰  She shouted at Piccolo.  „Chi-Chi, I must.  Gokou would want it that way.‰  Piccolo told 
Chi-Chi.  „Chi-Chi, I don‚t want Trunks to fight but if it will save Earth.  They should.‰  Bulma told Chi-
Chi.  „Fine.‰  Chi-Chi said with a wave of a hand.  Piccolo and Olibu grabs Goten and Trunks and fly off in 
separate directions.  „Well, I guess we should go train you guys.‰  Krillen announced and flew off and so 
did Yamcha, Tien, and Choazu.  We then see a gigantic palace and a giant, red faced man sat with a desk 
and a tag on his desk said  „King Yamma.‰  Before the great desk and man, stoop Vageta and Gokou and a 
old, wrinkly, large man that looked like Piccolo.  „Guru!!!‰  King Yamma exclaimed.  „Hello, King 
Yamma.  It‚s a pleasure to meet you again.‰ Guru greeted.   „How are things going on Earth?‰  King 
Yamma asked Guru.  „Well, King Yamma.  Not so good as a matter a fact.  That‚s what I came here to ask 
you.‰  Answered Guru.  While this conversation is going on Gokou and Vageta are looking around.  
„What‚s your request?‰  King Yamma asked.  „The two strongest warriors:  Gokou and Vageta be trained 
by Master Roshi.‰  Guru told King Yamma.  „You want these two be trained by the great, the excellent 
Master Roshi?‰  King Yamma asked.  „If it‚s not a burden on Master Roshi but it‚s very important you see.  
Two very, very strong beings are approaching earth in 1 earth year and we need all the training we need.  
„Let me contact Master Roshi.‰  King Yamma told Guru.  King Yamma then closed his eyes as if in a 
trance.  „Pssst∑Guru, what is that guy doing?‰  Asked Gokou in a whisper.  „Shush!‰  Guru told Gokou.  
„He‚s contacting Master Roshi.‰  Gokou still looked confused.  King Yamma then opened his eyes and 
looked through his papers.  „Well?‰  Guru asked.  „It seems here no one has scheduled to meet with the 
great Master Roshi and he seems free.  He is very intrigued by Gokou and Vageta here and would like to 
meet them.‰  King Yamma told them.  „Well, isn‚t that something.‰  Guru said.  Guru then turns to Gokou 
and Vageta.  „Ok, in order to go see Master Roshi, you must make your way through the long Snake Way.  
Personal will guide you to the entrance.‰  Guru explained.  „Ok‰  Gokou and Vageta said.  Back on Earth, 
Piccolo has Goten near the Panton Mountain region while Olibu has Trunks near the Youkuzan Valley 
Region.  „Stop that inferno crying!!‰  Piccolo angrily yelled at the crying Goten.  
„WAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!‰  Goten cried constantly.  „Don‚t you realize the power you have inside 
of you?‰  Piccolo asked Goten.  „What power?‰  Asked Goten which was pretty confused at the whole 
power business.  Piccolo slaps his hand in his face in disbelief.  „You don‚t even know it?‰  Piccolo asked 
Goten.  Goten just shakes his head.  „Here let me just show you.‰  Piccolo said and at that, he raises his 
hand in front of Goten.  „Masenko-Ha!!!‰  Piccolo yelled and a yellow, purple beam shot from his hand and 
it‚s heading straight for Goten.  „Whaaaa!!!!‰  Goten screamed as the deadly energy ball streaked towards 
Goten.  Just then, Goten exploded in anger and swatted the energy ball away, directing it into a mountain 
exploding it and sending debris all over.  „That‚s it.‰  Piccolo muttered to himself.  Goten‚s power then 
faded and he collapsed and fell asleep.  „What we need to do now is trigger that power.‰  Piccolo said.  The 
scene changes and we see Trunks laying around and Olibu standing over Trunks.  „O.K.  Go time.‰  Olibu 
says to Trunks.  „Yeah.  Whatever.‰  Trunks answers Olibu.  „Are you just going to lay there?‰  Olibu 
asked.  „Hey, your blocking the sun.  I‚m tanning here.‰  Trunks rudely told Olibu.  Olibu with disgust, 
picked up Trunks.  „Hey.  Leggo!!  I‚m getting up!!  Ouch!!‰  Yells Trunks.  „Here let me show you the 
power you have.‰  Olibu informed Trunks and Olibu threw Trunks far into the distance.  
„AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!‰  Trunks screamed as he is sent careening to the nearby mountain.  
Just then, a white aura surrounds Trunks and Trunks scream.  He shoots a energy blast, exploding the 
mountain.  Olibu flies over to were Trunks is falling and grabs him.  „There we go.‰  Olibu said to the un-
conscience Trunks.  We then see Sky Palace and Yamcha and Tien sparring it.  „Yaahh, Yahhh. Hut, 
Yeah.‰  Tien and Yamcha scream as they train extensively and Krillen and Choazu train hard in the 
background.  „Guru, will the Earth‚s Special Forces be enough to defeat the upcoming Sayjins‰  Asked a 
white cat with a walking stick.  „I have no idea Korin.  Piccolo and Goten are training and same with Olibu 
and Trunks.  Krillen, Tien, Choazu, and Yamcha are training here.  They will prove to be some resistance 
to the Sayjins but the true power lies with Gokou and Vageta.  King Kai should of collected the Dragon 
Balls by now.‰  Guru answered Karin.  „COME FORTH PORUNGA!!!  I WANT YOU TO GRANT US A 
WISH!!!‰  King Kai commanded.  Seven spherical balls before King Kai begin to glow and light shoots up 
to the clouds.  When the light vanishes, a giant Dragon-Toad like creature emerges.  „Who has summoned 
thee by thy enternal sleep.  What is thy desire?‰  Porunga asked King Kai.  „PORUNGA, CAN YOU 
BRING BACK VAGETA AND GOKOU FROM THE DEAD?‰  King Kai asked.  A short pause while the 
dragon seeks the wish.  „I am sorry.  The ones you call Vageta and Gokou can not brought back to life.  
They are pupils of the great, Master Roshi.  They must stay in the other realm for at least a year.‰  
Answered Porunga.  „Then, Porunga, can you bring them back a year from now?‰  King Kai asked.  „That 
can be done.  A year from now, the ones you call Vageta and Gokou will come back to life.‰  The dragon 
answered and he then, in a brilliant, blinding light, disappears into the balls and the balls shoot out in 
different directions so they can be found by another explorer.  We now see two familiar heroes riding in the 
back of a beat up jalopy.  „So how long will it take?‰  Gokou asked the driver.  „Oh, it‚s not that far to the 
entrance.  A couple more miles or so.  I‚ve been doing this path for∑gosh how long.  Hundred years?  The 
heavenly being said.  „A hundred years?!?  Gokou exclaimed in astonishment.  „Oh yeah.  I‚m still 
considered a new employee.  You achieve a veteran employee after you work here for about∑a thousand 
years.  Vageta‚s and Gokou‚s eyes widen at what they heard.  The jalopy screeches to a halt.  „Well, we‚re 
here.  The entrance to snake way and the starting point to Master Roshi‚s Planet.‰  Vageta and Gokou walk 
of out of the car.  „Thanks a lot.‰  Gokou told the man.  „How far is it to Master Roshi‚s Planet?‰  Vageta 
asked.  „Well, I‚ve never even set foot on snake way but I heard it‚s about 1,000,000,000 miles.‰  The man 
said intelligently.  „1,000,000,000 MILES?!?!?‰  Gokou and Vageta roared.  „How will we get there before 
those darn Sayjins get here?!?  Hollered Vageta.  „What Sayjins?‰  The man asked bewildered at what 
Vageta was hollering about.  „Never mind.‰  Gokou told him with a pat on the shoulder.  „Vageta, we 
should get there pretty soon though since we can fly.‰  Gokou informed Vageta.  „Oh yeah.  I never thought 
of that.  We should get there in 2 days then.‰  Vageta said.  It was the mans turn for his jaw to drop.  „2 
DAYS?!?!  He yelled.  „That‚s if we don‚t make any stops.‰  Gokou added.  The man turns around and gets 
into his jalopy still bewildered.  „Yeah.  O.k.  Have a nice trip.‰  He says.  „Thanks.  Gokou and Vageta say 
together and they turn around and start to walk towards to the entrance of Snake Way.  (I wonder how the 
guys back on Earth are doing?)  Gokou wonders.  (I hope they are training as much as we will once we get 
to Snake Way.)  He thinks.  „Come on Vageta.  Let‚s hit the road.‰  Gokou tells Vageta and takes of in a 
trail of white energy.  „Yeah.  Gokou, lets.‰  Vageta answers back and takes off after Gokou.  On Earth, 
Krillen and the others are taking a break.  „I wonder what training Gokou and Vageta are getting in the 
other dimension?‰  Krillen asks.  „Krillen, they were sent to be trained by the great Master Roshi.  One of 
the greatest martial arts master of this side of the galaxy.  He overseas the East Side of this galaxy.  There 
are three other martial arts masters that oversea their own galaxy which is South, East, and West.‰  Guru 
explained.  „If I remember right, West is Master Tsuru, Master Roshi‚s  rival.  The North is Master Baba, 
who is very powerful in the arcane magic and the South is Master Mutaito, who is strong in the martial arts 
too .  I‚ve never met none of the Master‚s.  I haven‚t even met Master Roshi.‰  Guru finished telling his 
story.  (I just hope their strong enough!)  Krillen thought.  „O.K.  Guy‚s get back to training!‰  Guru 
announced and walked into his palace.  We see Goten carrying fish and lumber.  „Hum, dee, dum, hum, 
dee, dum, dum, dum, dee, hum.‰  Goten happily hummed and dummed as we walked.  „This should be 
enough for me and Mister Piccolo.‰  Goten happily said.  Goten then looks up at the sky.  „The sky is 
getting darker.‰  Goten said.  „WOW!!  It looks like a picture with all those purple, orange, blues and reds.‰  
Goten exclaimed and he got on his way.  Further on, Piccolo is in deep meditation.  (Gokou, Vageta.  I 
hope the strength your receiving from Master Roshi will be enough.  I have a bad feeling about this.)  Just 
then Piccolo opens his eyes.  „AHHHHHHHHH!!!‰  Piccolo screams and grows a light blue.  Just then, a 
Piccolo steps from the original Piccolo and stands besides him and another Piccolo comes out and stands on 
the opposite side of the other fake Piccolo.  Piccolo raises both his arms and two form a „X‰ with their 
arms as their blocking for whatever Piccolo is going to dish out.  „Cannon Beam!!!!‰  Piccolo screams as 
he shoots energy beams from his two hands.  The two beams collide creating a big explosion.   The first 
fake flies threw the smoke and nails Piccolo right in the stomach causing Piccolo to bend over with great 
pain.  Then Piccolo Fake 2 comes up and elbows Piccolo in the back sending him into the ground.  Piccolo 
Fake 1 then appears before Piccolo thinking that Piccolo is out.  But Piccolo‚s eyes open and he fires a 
energy beam knocking Fake 1 in the ground.  „Rest time.‰  Piccolo says and the fakes merge with the 
original.  That‚s when Gohan comes in.

- Chapter 4 -</H3>

<P>„Last time Dragon Ball XL:  Chapter 3.  Gokou and Vageta were accepted by Master Roshi to be trained 
for a year for the upcoming Sayjins.  Vageta makes a astounding announcement they can make it their 
within two days.  While on Earth, Krillen, Yamcha, Tien, and Choazu are training under the supervision of 
Guru and Korin.  Piccolo is also training Goten and Olibu is training Trunks for the upcoming Sayjins.  
They believe Trunks and Goten, once their powers are awaken, can be the strongest fighters in the universe.

<P>„I‚m hungry.  I wish their was a McDonalds or something.‰  Gokou tells Vageta as they are cruising along 
snake way.  „Gokou, your always hungry.  When aren‚t you hungry?‰  Vageta asks angrily.  „When I‚m not 
hungry.‰  Gokou answers Vageta.  Vageta puts his hand in front of his face and sighs.  „That seems 
logical.‰  Vageta admits.  Back on Earth, Goten and Piccolo are fighting.  „C-mon, Goten.  Is that all you 
got.  The Sayjins will turn you into mush with this kind of fighting.‰  Piccolo says, teasing Goten.  „That‚s 
all I can do.‰  Goten says in deep breaths.  „Your father must be the cause of this.  Always laid back.  Your 
father is good for nothing.  You hear me?  GOOD FOR NOTHING!!!‰  Piccolo yells but knows by doing 
this.  Goten will get angry revealing his power.  „No he‚s not!!‰  Goten shouts.  „YOUR FATHER IS A 
WEAKLING!!  A WASTE!!‰  Piccolo shouts.  „Stop insulting him, Mr. Piccolo.‰  Goten says.  „I can‚t 
here you, Goten.  You must be as dim and a weakling like your father.‰  Piccolo teases.  „My father is not 
a∑. WEAKLING!!!!‰  Goten yells in rage and powers up.  „Finally.‰  Piccolo says to himself and prepares 
for the power.  Goten flies at Piccolo and kicks Piccolo in the head, sending Piccolo swirling and then gets 
underneath him and punches him in the gut sending Piccolo high in the air.  Goten then appears in front of 
Piccolo and double-fist slams Piccolo sending him to the ground.  Piccolo hits the ground hard, creating a 
crater and Goten lands far from him and as soon as he hits the ground,  he comes streaking towards Piccolo 
who managed to get up.  „MY FATHER IS NOT A GOOD FOR NOTHING!!‰  Goten yells as he streaks 
at Piccolo and he slams his fist right in Piccolo‚s arm and as we see Goten fly past, we Piccolo‚s arm 
getting shot out from his body and blood flying up.  „AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!‰  Piccolo yells in agony as his 
arm separates from his body and he collapses.  As soon as Goten lands from the attack, he looks back and 
to his horror, he sees that he knocked of Piccolo‚s arm clear off from his body.  „M∑M∑.Mr. P.. 
Piccolo?‰  Goten stumbles.  Piccolo then weakly stands up and turns to Goten and smiles.  „Don‚t worry 
Goten.‰  Piccolo assures Goten and he yells. From where his old arm used to be, a new arm emerges from 
the wound.  „Much better.‰  Piccolo says.  Goten‚s face turns to terror and stutters.  „H∑H∑.H∑.How did 
you∑do that?‰  Goten asks Piccolo in horror.  „It‚s a trait.‰  Piccolo answers Goten while stretching and 
exercising his new arm.  „All Namekians can grow new limbs if they lose one.‰  Piccolo tells Goten.  
„What‚s a Namekia∑.whatever you call it?‰  Goten asks Piccolo.  „It‚s what I am.  I‚m actually a alien, the 
green skin, the weird arm and legs patches, the pointy ears, and the two antenna give it away, I guess.‰  
Piccolo answers Goten.  Goten thinks for a little bit and asks.  „What‚s a alien?‰  Piccolo sighs and rolls his 
eyes.  „It‚s a different being that doesn‚t live on Earth.  My ancestors were from Planet namek.  I was born 
on Planet Earth but my parent was from Namek.‰  Piccolo explains thoroughly to Goten.  „Got it?‰ Piccolo 
asks.  „I think so.‰  Goten answers Piccolo.  We then see Olibu and Trunks fighting and it looks like they 
are gaining more ground then Piccolo and Goten.  „Your good Trunks.‰  Olibu comments Trunks.  „You 
are too.  I wish I was strong as you and Mr. Piccolo.‰  Trunks exclaims as they are exchanging blows.  
Olibu changes the subject.  „I want to see your power.‰  Olibu tells trunks.  Trunks stops fighting.  „What 
power?‰ Trunks asks.  „I guess I‚ll have to drive it out of ya.‰  Olibu tells trunks and he runs at trunks and 
knees him in the gut and then grabs Trunks arm and punches Trunks hard in the face, sending Trunks to the 
ground.  Olibu then steps in Trunk‚s foot and starts to twist and turn his foot so he will inflict pain.  „Mr. 
Olibu.  What are you doing?‰  Trunks weakly asks.  Olibu keeps on twisting his foot.  (Come on trunks.  I 
don‚t want to inflict more pain.  This is tearing me up inside.)  Olibu thinks.  Olibu then grabs Trunks head 
and throws him high in the air and flies up at him.  Olibu then comes in front of Trunks and flip kicks him, 
sending him ground wards.  Olibu then catches Trunks foot and slams him into a mountain wall and drags 
him down the wall causing great pain to trunks but great discomfort to Olibu.  Olibu pulls Trunks from the 
wall and slams him hard into the ground.  After a while,  there is a shake in the ground.  Just then, rocks 
begin to lift up and the place explodes with energy flinging Olibu high in the air.  A blur sends him into the 
ground.  Trunks then appears on Olibu‚s back and starts to punch him repeatedly.  Olibu reaches a hand and 
grabs trunks by the head.  „Hey.  What are you doing.  Ow.  Leggo!!‰  Trunks yells trying to get off Olibu‚s 
massive hand.  Olibu stands up and brings Olibu face to face with trunks and smiles.  „That‚s the power 
I‚m talking about.‰   Olibu tells Trunks.  Trunks raises his hands and looks at them.  Back on Sky Palace, 
Krillen, Yamcha, Choazu, and Tien are training vigorously.  „Yah, yah, heh!!‰  Krillen shouts as he is 
sparring Yamcha.  „Good going, Krillen!!‰  Yamcha says while blocking Krillen‚s punches and kicks.  
Guru and Korin then step out of Sky Palace and witness the training.  „Guru, maybe they should use the 
Pendulum Room?  It would be a fast way to get power.‰  Korin asked Guru.  „I think your right, Korin.‰  
Guru answered.  He turns to them.  „Krillen, Yamcha, Tien, and Choazu!!‰  Guru shouts and the group 
walks over.  „What‚s up, Guru?‰  Tien asks.  „To have you gain more power.  I will be sending you in the 
Pendulum Room.‰  Guru answered Tien‚s question.  „What‚s a Pendulum Room?‰  Krillen confusedly 
asks.  „It‚s a room where you can go back in time.  I will be sending you to where the Sayjin‚s once reign 
to have you practice on.  You can‚t die which is good but you will feel pain.  „Well, count me in.‰  Yamcha 
tells Guru and rest agrees and they start to walk into the palace.  After a while, they come to a golden door 
and Guru‚s lifts his hand and touches the door.  His hand shakes and trembles and then the latch on the 
door unlocks and the door swings open.  The group walks into a room with a huge, giant pendulum swing 
back and forth, creating powerful winds that almost knocks Choazu over.  „This my friends, is the 
Pendulum Room.  Step on the small red circle.‰  Guru tells the group.  The group obeys and they all crowd 
on the small circle.  „Hatcchedemudum - laddefundum ˆ penterauenumidea ˆ reah!!!‰  Guru shouts and the 
room blacks out.  „Where are we?‰  Comes Yamcha‚s voice.  „And why is so dark?‰  Krillens voice sounds 
out.  Just then light restores itself and we see Krillen, Yamcha, Tien, and Choazu standing on a rusted, beat 
up platform surrounded by rubbles and dead bodies.  „What happened here?‰  Tien asked.  „It looks like a 
genocide.‰  Choazu comments.  Just then a large, deafening explosion rocks the ground and the fighters get 
into their fighting stance.  Four figures appear from the smoke and fire.  A chubby, fat man with a mustache 
and bull cut.  A small, women with short hair, a very large man with a weird hairstyle, and a man with 
spikes hair and a mustache.  „Who goes there?‰  Yells the man with the spiked hair and mustache.  „We‚re 
not from around here!‰  Krillen shouts.  „What‚s going on here?‰  Krillen asks.  „This planet is about to be 
sold to Lord Buu!‰  The fat one shouts.  „Lord Buu?‰  Yamcha asks.  „Anyway, who are you guys?‰  Tien 
asks.  „I am Paragus.‰ The spiked hair guy with mustaches.  Tells them.  „I‚m Serpia.‰  The women says.  
„I‚m Panbukin.‰  The fat one says.  „And I‚m Totepo.‰  The big one says.  „And who Lord Buu is.  He‚s 
the most powerful fighter in the universe.  No force can match his greatness.‰  Paragus answers the crew. 
„But why do you have to destroy this planet?‰  Yamcha asks angrily.  „It‚s for Lord Buu.‰  Panbukin tells 
them.  „Hey boss, it sounds like they want a fight.‰  Totepo tells Paragus.  Paragus then flies at Krillen and 
tries to punch him but Krillen dodges at the nick of time.  Serpia flies after Yamcha and tries to kick 
Yamcha but Yamcha blocks it.  Totepo attacks Tien and tries to punch Tien but Tien matches the blow.  
Panbukin attacks Choazu but Choazu uses his kinetic energy and stops him in mid-air.  The fights 
continues and the Z Fighters actually seem to be losing.  Paragus slams Krillen into a concrete wall leaving 
a face impression on the wall and they flings him into a transportation vehicle.  Krillen lays there, gasping 
for air while Paragus walks over to where he lays.  Serpia smacks Yamcha in the face sending him flying to 
the ground and as soon as Yamcha gets up, she flies down and lands her feet on his face, slamming him 
back down again.  She jumps of and kicks Yamcha in the spine sending him through a building and on to 
the roof.  She then flies up there.  Totepo head butts Tien in the chest knocking him into a plant like thing.  
Totepo then double-fist slams Tien in the stomach sending him into the pavement.  He then garbs Tien by 
the head and punches Tien in the face, sending him into a far away building and he lays there.  Totepo flies 
over to Tien.  Panbukin punches Choazu into the ground and falls down and squishes him.  He gets up and 
grabs Choazu and knees him in the face and then he flies up and throws him into the ground.  Panbukin 
continues his assault by flying at him.  Paragus stands over Krillen.  „It‚s been a good work out for me.‰  
Paragus says as he chuckles.  He then raises his hand.  Serpia gets to Yamcha finally.  „Your such a jerk.  I 
only ask strong men out.‰  Serpia says and she raises her hand.  Totepo stops in front of Tien.  „Good 
riddance.‰  Totepo says and raises his hand.  Panbukin reaches Choazu and lands over him.  „You‚ve been 
a naughty boy.  I‚m going to report you to your parents.‰  Panbukin teases Choazu and he raises his hands.  
Krillen, Yamcha, Tien, and Choazu look in terror as they all fire a energy blast at the same time.  
„What!?!?!‰  Krillen yells as he wakes up suddenly.  Krillen looks around and sees the dim shapes of Tien, 
Yamcha, and Choazu talking to Korin and Guru.  „Whew!‰  Krillen says as he wipes his forehead.  He 
stands up and walks over to the group.  „Was that a dream?‰  Krillen asks.  „No, that was real.  You 
experienced it in your conscience.‰  Guru told Krillen.  Then he addressed everybody.  „You guys did great 
in there.  Better then I ever would expect.‰  Guru told them.  „But we died.‰  Krillen sadly said.  „Yes, you 
did.  But you should much courage in the fight.  You kept your heads in there and buckled down and I‚m 
proud of that.  Any normal man would of died instantly after the first punch was thrown.‰  Guru told them 
but then his happy grin turns to a frown.  „But those Sayjins aren‚t nothing compared to these two Sayjins 
now.  I suggest we train hard non-stop.  They all nod there heads.  Back on Snake way, Gokou and Vageta 
are flying really fast towards Master Roshi‚s Planet.  „Gokou, it‚s been about a day.  Wanna take a short 
rest?‰  Vageta asks Gokou.  „Sure, some R and R sounds great!‰  Gokou cheerfully says as Vageta and him 
slowly float to the ground and walk a ways.

<P>„Last time on Dragon Ball XL:  Chapter 4.  Piccolo and Olibu have been able to harness Goten and Trunks 
incredible Sayjin power.  While, Gokou and Vageta are flying towards Master Roshi‚s planet, Tien, 
Krillen, Yamcha, and Choazu travel back in time and face 4 powerful Sayjins.  The Sayjins defeat them 
rather easily and they make a startling discovery that the up-coming Sayjins are stronger then that.‰

<P>Back on Snake Way, Gokou and Vageta are well on their way to Master Roshi‚s planet.  „I wonder what 
Master Roshi is like?‰  Gokou asks Vageta.  „Don‚t know.‰  Vageta answers.  „Maybe he‚s strong.  He 
must be since they talk about him so∑..so∑..respectfully.‰  Vageta says, searching for words.  „Yeah.  
The great Master Roshi.‰  Gokou mocks.  They speed on their way.  On Planet Earth, Goten and Piccolo 
are training extensively.  „Goten, your doing it.‰  Piccolo tells Goten.  „Thanks.‰  Goten answers Piccolo 
back.  Goten and Piccolo are punching back and forth.  Olibu and Trunks are also training quite hard.  
„Hey, you got it!!‰  Olibu tells Trunks while they are fighting.  Trunks gives him a nod.  On Sky Palace, 
Krillen and Yamcha are sparring and Choazu and Tien are sparring.  „Kamehameha!!‰  Krillen yells  and a 
bright-bluish energy beam shoots towards Yamcha.  Yamcha yells and energy explodes around him, 
sending a gush of wind sending the Kamehameha upwards.  „Whoa!!‰  Krillen says as he watches the 
Kamehameha disappearing out of site.  Yamcha then flies at Krillen and punches him in the face and they 
start going again.  „Tri-beam!!‰  Tien yells as he shoots a small energy beam from his triangular-formed 
hands.  Choazu holds up his hands and stops the beam and the beam explodes.  Tien exits from the light 
and kicks Choazu into the ground and then Choazu gets up and punches Tien in the jaw and they start 
fighting.  „Guru, will this be enough?‰  Korin asks Guru.  „Yamcha, Krillen, Tien, Choazu, Piccolo, and 
Olibu may prove some resistance against them.  But our true strength lies in the hands of Gokou, Goten, 
Vageta, and Trunks.‰  The fighters continue sparring. 
 In space, two pods streak though the emptiness.  Inside is a burly, bald-headed man with a Sayjin Scouter 
and Armor and a mustache.  In the second spacepod, is a man with long hair in a pony tail, Sayjin Scouter 
and Armor.  „General Brolly, we are enclosing on the Planet Konat.  Would you like to make a rest stop.‰  
Brolly slowly opens his eyes and turns his head.  „Hey Nappa, do you want to make a pit stop.  Theirs a 
planet called Konat?‰  Brolly asks through the speaker.  Brolly waits for a response.  „Sure Brolly. That 
sounds good.‰  A crackled voice comes in.  The two spacepods speed towards Planet Konat.  The two 
spacepods gently land on a dusty surface, surrounded by weird trees.  The Sayjins step out and looks 
around.  Nappa presses the red button on his Scouter.  „General Brolly, I‚m picking up some powerlevels 
around the 200 range.‰  Nappa informs Brolly.  „That shouldn‚t be a problem.‰  Brolly says, stretching his 
arms.  „Sir, theirs 4 250 power levels coming towards here fast.‰  Nappa tells Brolly.  „That‚s fine.‰  Brolly 
says.  Four amphibian looking creatures come streaking towards them in high-tech speeders that looks like 
flies.  „Freeze, your under-arrest.  You have the right to remain silent!!‰  The police-thing yells into his 
speaker.  Brolly looks at Nappa and gives him a smile.  They both put up their arms.  „We have no 
weapons.‰  Brolly informs them.  The 4 policemen come over a slap high-tech handcuffs and lead them 
into their speeders.  They speed of and Brolly gives Nappa a quick glance and Nappa nods his head.  They 
then reach, a very tall palace with small, flying, lizard things circling around.  They enter through the 
palace and Nappa and Brolly are lead to a prison.  Inside their, theirs a man that just looks like one of the 
police cop.  „Why are you in here for?‰  The man asks the two.  „I guess trespassing.‰  Nappa says.  „Yeah.  
I see.  Let me you in a secret.‰  The man covers the side of mouth and talks quietly.  „I‚m the former owner 
of this planet.‰  He looks for any signs of surprise in the faces of the strangers but they show none.  „I was 
overthrown by a rebel and he took the queen, my wife.  He threw me in jail and soon enough will kill me.‰  
The former king said.  „What a shame.‰  Brolly said without caring.  Just then, two Egyptian-dressed 
guards walk over and unlocked the gate.  „You two.  You have the privilege of participating in the 
„games‰.‰  The guard evilly says.  „I‚m honored.‰  Nappa said.  The guard gives him a sneer.  Brolly and 
Nappa are lead though a dark, damp hallway into a bright, lighted room with stands full of the race, 
cheering and booing.  On a throne, a royal dressed creature sits, high above everyone else.  Next to him is 
the queen, dressed richly and luxuriously.  The king stands up.  „ I am proud to present you the „Games‰!!‰  
The king shouts and the place erupts in applause.  „Our challengers were captured this mourning by our 
royal cops.  They will be facing the Royal Army!!‰  The king shouts and a gate opens up with the 
amphibious-fish looking creatures dressed up in armor riding on weird looking bird like animals.  They are 
carrying great spears with electricity flowing through them.  They charge at the Sayjins and with a big, 
bright light.  They all disappear.  Nappa puts down his hand that‚s flowing with energy.  The crowd gasps 
and the king falls of his seat.  Enraged, the king stands up and gives a signal.  On the west side of the ring, a 
giant door opens up and huge creature, of the same race, emerges.  The crowd cheers and the thing raises 
up his hands and roars.  Brolly then flies up and kicks him in the head sending him in the ground.  The 
thing grabs Nappa and slams him into the crowd.  The place erupts in cheers.  Just then, the creature is 
lifted high above Nappa‚s head as he lifts the thing up, he throws it into a section of the ring, killing several 
spectators.  Brolly then sends a blast killing the monster and the room starts to fall apart.  Brolly sees the 
king run away and he follow him.  Brolly reaches him, grabs him by the neck, and lifts him high.  „Please 
don‚t kill me.  You can be king.‰  The king nervously screams.  Brolly smiles and he closes his hands and 
throws the king aside.  We see Brolly broke the kings neck.  Brolly and Nappa call for their spaceships and 
they take of.  The planet then explodes into tiny pieces while the two pods take off.  On Snake Way,  
Gokou and Vageta are still flying.  Gokou‚s eyes then widen and points ahead.  „Look a small, planet!  
That must be Master Roshi‚s planet!!‰  Vageta puts his hands over his eyes so he can see.  „I think your 
right for once, Gokou!!‰  Vageta exclaims.  Gokou and Vageta then power up and head for the small 
planet.  After a while, they reach it and float a mile above it.  Just then, Vageta and Gokou are pulled down 
into the small planet and they hit the ground hard.  „I guess this planet has a stronger gravity pull then 
Earth‚s.‰  Vageta says.  „Yeah‰  Gokou adds.  They struggle to get up.  Just then, a old looking man in a 
white beard with a weird jacket with a insignia on it, steps in front of them.  „Need any help?‰  The man 
asks.  Gokou looks up and his eyes widen. „How can you handle this much gravity?!?‰  Gokou yells.  „You 
must be Gokou.‰  The old man says and he looks at Vageta.  „And you must be Vageta.‰  The old man 
adds.  „How do you know our names?‰  Vageta asks, face down on the ground.  „Hi, I‚m Master Roshi.‰  
Master Roshi says.  Gokou and Vageta then try to get up as quickly as they can but struggle.  They do 
maintain their balance though.  Master Roshi inspects them, looking at every detail and then nods.  „Yep, 
you two are defiantly full-blooded Sayjins.‰  Roshi says.  „What do you mean by that?‰  Vageta asks 
Master Roshi.  „Gokou and you are both hundred percent, full-blooded Sayjins.  Both your father and 
mother were Sayjins.  Have that down?‰  Master Roshi asks.  „Yeah.  We do.‰  They both said, shaking 
their heads in agreement.  Master Roshi then turns their back to them.  „So I suppose I‚m have to train to 
two then?‰  Master Roshi asks them.  „Well, the Sayjins∑..‰  Gokou was interrupted by Master Roshi.  „I 
know, I know.  Brolly and Nappa are on their way to Earth.  They are already half-way their.  „Their 
what?!?!‰  Gokou exclaimed.  „It‚s been about.‰  Master Roshi thinks a moment.  „6 months since you 
died.  Everyone on Earth is becoming quite strong.‰  Master Roshi explained.  „We have no time to spare 
then.  Master Roshi, train us!‰  Vageta ordered Roshi.  Master Roshi turns around to Vageta and puts up his 
finger.  „Vageta, Gokou and you must pass a qualifying test before I train you.‰  Roshi informs them.  „A 
qualifying test?‰  Gokou asks Master Roshi.  „Yes, a qualifying test.  You can‚t train with the great Master 
Roshi if your not worthy and not strong enough.‰  Master Roshi answers Gokou.  „Well, what are the 
tests?‰  Vageta asks Roshi.  „You have to pass 3 tests.  These will help you get use to the planets gravity.  
The first test is to fight and beat Oolong, the pig.‰  Master Roshi tells them and he then puts his two fingers 
to his mouth, and whistles and a small pig walks up wearing a white-t shirt and black pants.  „How stupid!  
We have to catch a pig?!‰  Vageta exclaims.  „I‚m not just any ordinary pig.‰  Oolong  He jumps up and in 
a poof of smoke, turns into a 70 foot giant.  „How are we supposed to beat him?‰  Gokou exclaims as he 
stares at Oolong.  „I see your wise.‰  Oolong teases.  He lifts up his hand and smacks it at Gokou.  Gokou 
dodges and does a roll.  „Gokou, remember what King Kai told us.  Size doesn‚t matter.  I can clearly see 
this Oolong isn‚t that strong.‰  Vageta explains to Gokou.  Gokou stares at Oolong and then shows a big 
grin on his face.  He cups his hands around his mouth.  „Hey Oolong!‰  You know you‚re not that strong?!‰  
Gokou shouts.  The fighting between Gokou and Vageta Vs Oolong stops shortly with Gokou and Vageta 
being the victor.  They then have to race the shape-shifting cat, Puar who turned itself into a rocket.  After 
several tries, Vageta and Gokou both out race Puar.  Now for the final test.  „You have defeated Oolong 
and Puar.  Now comes the hardest test.  You must eat more then I can in a eating contest.‰  Master Roshi 
tells them.  before Roshi could finish though.  Vageta and Gokou were already at the table, fork and knife 
in hands, and napkins neatly tucked into their shirts.  (Maybe the eating contest wasn‚t a good idea.)  Roshi 
thought.  Master Roshi enters the house followed closely by Oolong and Puar.  Master Roshi sits down and 
Puar turns into a gun and sounds the contest and before Roshi could even start.  Vageta and Gokou were on 
seconds that quickly turned into thirds that then turned into fourths and so on and so forth.  By the time 
Master Roshi could finish his first helping, Vageta and Gokou were done with their tenth and the contest 
was over.  „My stars.  You guys sure are incredible and after passing the 3 contest, with flying colors, I will 
train you guys.‰  Master Roshi tells Gokou and Vageta and they smile and nod.  Some time goes by and 
Vageta and Gokou finally learned the gods powerup, the Kaio-ken and the devastating, Spirit Bomb and 
almost a year has passed.  „You guys certainly ranks #1 on Master Roshi‚s hall of fame!‰  Master Roshi 
says to Gokou and Vageta.  They thank him and with the power of the dragon balls, they fade to living 
realm.  We see the two spacepods and Earth in it‚s view.

-Chapter 6-</H3>

<P>„Last time on Dragon Ball XL:  Chapter 5.  The Z Fighters on Earth are training really hard as the evil 
Sayjins approached.  The Sayjins, Nappa and Brolly decide to make a pit stop on Planet Konat and leave 
with a bang.  Literally.  Gokou an Vageta must pass 3 test to be trained by Master Roshi.  They pass the 
tests with flying colors and they learn the Kaio-ken and the Spirit Bomb.  By the power of the Dragon balls, 
they disappear to go home.‰

<P>„General Brolly, Planet Earth is directly in front of us.  We will reach their in approximately 3 minutes.‰  
Comes a voice.  „Hey Nappa.  wake up.  you might want to see this.‰  Brolly yells at Nappa though the 
intercom.  Nappa slowly blinks his eyes, yawns and stretch.  He then smiles.  „We‚re their, huh?‰  Nappa 
asks Brolly.  „Yeah.  Hey Nappa, does Earth look like a giant blueberry?‰  Brolly sarcastically asks Nappa.  
„Yeah.  I like blueberries.‰  Nappa answers Brolly as he licks his lips.  „Just be on your toes, Nappa.  We 
don‚t know what we are in for.  By all we know, those guys could be a thousand times stronger then us.‰  
Brolly informs Nappa.  Theirs silence.  Three minutes has passed and they enter Earth‚s atmosphere.  In a 
busy metropolis, their cars and people crowding the streets and side walks.  A little boy, holding on to a 
balloon, looks up into the blue sky with a cloudy forecast.  We see two white sparkles coming straight 
down.  The boys eyes widen and pulls on his fathers jacket.  The father looks down at his son and the boys 
finger points up.  The man looks up and sees, larger before, items coming straight down.  
„AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!‰  The man screams alerting everyone to look up.  Panic erupts as people run in fear.  
We see the spacepods clearly as they descend onto the city.  They crash though the city, knocking some sky 
scrapers down and then land into a busy highway.  Smoke and dust settle and Brolly and Nappa emerge 
from the spacepods and float onto the pavement.  They look around and Nappa presses his beeper.  „I‚m 
picking up several high powerlevels but I‚m not picking up Vageta and Prince Kakoratte‚s powerlevel 
anywhere.‰  Nappa informs Brolly and Brolly swats him on the head.  „You fool.  Vageta and Prince 
Kakoratte were killed in the battle of Turlis and Raditz.  Don‚t you remember.‰  Brolly asks sounding 
annoyed at Nappa‚s utter stupidly.  Nappa rubs his bald head where Brolly smacked it.  „I think so.‰  Nappa 
answers Brolly.  „No what are we going to do with all these bystanders?‰  Brolly asks himself, changing 
the subject.  Brolly lifts up his finger and Nappa also lifts his finger.  „Seeker Shot!!‰  They both yell and 
hundreds of energy beams shoot from their fingers and everybody around them all fall down.  After a 
while, they are done and Brolly pushes the red button.  „Everyone in this city is eradicated.‰  Brolly says 
with a smirk.  Piccolo, Olibu, Goten, Trunks, Tien, Choazu, Yamcha, and Krillen flying towards where 
they sensed the big drop of energy and then a sudden boost of energy.  „Man, are those the Sayjins?‰  
Krillen asks in despair.  „You know guys.  We can always turn around.‰  Yamcha nervously says.  „We 
will have to fight them someday so why not get it over with.‰  Piccolo calmly says and Yamcha gulps.  
They race towards where they sensed the energy.  On Snake Way, Vageta and Gokou are rushing as fast as 
they can towards the entrance of Snake way.  „Vageta, we are already half way there.‰  Gokou says to 
Vageta.  (I wonder if we can make it there in time before anyone dies?)  Vageta ponders as they race on, 
time against them.  Nappa‚s scouter beeps.  „General Brolly, 8 powerful forces are coming this way.‰  
Nappa informs Brolly.  Brolly presses the red button and numbers show on the scouter.  „I see, Nappa.  
Prepare for a battle.‰  Brolly tells Nappa.  (The true battle is when Vageta and Prince Kakoratte arrives.)  
Brolly thinks.  The Z Fighters arrive where Brolly and Nappa are and land.  They stare each other down.  
„Hey, you‚re a Namek.‰  Brolly says, pointing towards Piccolo.  „Where are the dragon balls?‰  Nappa 
asks Piccolo.  „Why would I tell you, friend?‰  Piccolo retorts back to Nappa.  „So you can live, Namek.‰  
Nappa answers Piccolo back.  „Nappa, we must keep the Namek alive until he reveals the dragon balls 
location.‰  Brolly informs Nappa.  „After he tells us the location.  I will let you have the honor of killing 
him.‰  Brolly assures Nappa.  „Think again, friend.  If I die, the Dragon Balls die.  Guru, the guardian of 
Earth and creator of the Dragon Balls, and I are linked.  If I die, the geezer dies, and so do the dragon balls.  
Your mission will be wasted.‰  Piccolo explains.  „Dang!‰  Brolly says.  Nappa steps forward to speak.  
„Who will fight first?‰  Nappa asks them.  Brolly comes next to Nappa and taps his shoulder.  „I have an 
Idea.  Let‚s have a tournament.  Before we get our new battle armor all dusty.  Let‚s have them face the 
Metas!‰  Brolly tells Nappa and Nappa  nods in agreement.  Brolly teleports into his spaceship and teleports 
back holding a black box.  He flips the lid up and pulls out seven, green like tablets.  He throws them onto 
the ground and starts to look around.  (I wonder where theirs a water source)  Brolly thinks.  Brolly spots a 
abandoned fire truck and teleports there.  Throwing away a dead fire-cop, he lifts up the truck with one 
hand and brings it over to the meeting place.  Setting the truck down, he takes out a hose from the truck and 
turns on the water.  He sprays the tablets, making sure he got everyone.  Shutting off the water, he throws 
the house away.  The tablets start to fizz and start to create smoke.  After a while, the smoke subsides and 
their stands seven small, toadyish-looking creatures with yellow eyes and no nose.  The size of Choazu, 
they foam at mouth and breath deep.  Brolly points over to the fire truck and one Meta goes up and lifts it 
up with two hands and throws it far into a skyscraper.  „Ok,  Who will be the first to fight the Metas?‰  
Nappa asks and Yamcha steps forward.  „I will be the first to face them.‰  Yamcha gets into his fighting 
stance and the 7 Metas charge towards Yamcha.  Yamcha yells and explodes with light, sending the Metas 
back.  Yamcha charges at Meta Number 5, kneeing it in the stomach and punching it in the head, 
completely turning it‚s head around, killing it.  It collapses and blows up.  Everyone on the side line is 
cheering until a Meta jumps up at Yamcha and clings onto his face.  „What the∑∑‰  Piccolo mutters as 
the things is about to glow.  The Meta yells as electricity jumps from the Meta onto Yamcha.  Yamcha is 
shaking all over and the Meta jumps off.  Yamcha falls to the ground, convulsing.  Yamcha screams and a 
dim outline of his skeleton shows from underneath him.  His eyes shoots out electricity and his mouth has 
electric bolts dancing around his mouth.  Just then, a brilliant light comes from Yamcha and after the light 
fades away.  Yamcha is gone.  „Yamcha!!‰  Krillen yells as he cries.  Brolly smirks.  „Who will the next to 
die?‰  Nappa asks them.  Trunks and Goten fly towards the Metas and fight against them.  Goten and 
Trunks are handling them pretty well.  (Their fighting technique is superb!  Are they Sayjins?)  Brolly 
ponders as Goten and Trunks, in rage of Yamcha‚s death, destroy every hellish monster.  It comes to the 
last Meta and it runs for his life.  „Kamehameha!!!‰  The boys yell and shoot two Kamehameha‚s that 
merge into one.  Th beam hits the Meta, vaporizing it.  Brolly and Nappa smirks.  Nappa steps forward.  
„Ok.  Good job.  You destroyed all the Metas but you will fight me next.  Now unlike the fight between 
you and the Metas.  You can all fight me.‰  Nappa announces.  Piccolo gets in his fighting position and 
charges at Nappa and kicks him,  Nappa raises his arm to block the kick, grabs Piccolo foot and throws him 
into a building.  Olibu comes flies behind and karate chops him in the neck.  Nappa bends forward and 
punches Olibu in the face sending him into through a truck into a department store.  Piccolo and Olibu done 
for the count, Nappa charges towards Tien, Krillen, and Choazu.  Nappa kicks Choazu sending Choazu 
high in the sky and Nappa proceeds to attack.  Choazu holds out his hands and stops Nappa in thin air.  
„Tien.  Use your Kikoho!!‰  Choazu shouts.  „Right!‰ Tien says and Tien starts charging up the Kikoho.  
„Hurry up.  I‚m not sure I can hold him anymore!‰  Choazu shouts and Tien shoots his Kikoho.  Nappa 
seeing this, shoots his eye lasers at Choazu, piercing through Choazu.  Nappa counters the attack and hits it 
back to Tien.  Choazu falls to the ground and hits the ground.  „CHOAZU!!!!!!‰  Tien yells and he looks up 
and sees his Kikoho coming straight towards him.  „NOOOOOO!!!!!‰  Tien shouts and he backs away.  
The blast collides with Tien‚s body, vaporizing Tien.  Krillen runs towards Choazu and reaches him.  
Krillen shakes Choazu violently.  „Choazu!!  Choazu!!‰  Krillen shouts.  Nappa holds out his hands.  
„Destruction Beam!!‰  Nappa yells as a greenish beam shoots from Nappa‚s palms.  Krillen looks back and, 
in horror, sees the Destruction Beam heading straight towards him.  Just then Olibu and Piccolo zanzoken 
in front of Krillen and swat the beam away.  They fly up and knee Nappa hard in the stomach, cracking his 
Sayjin Armor.  „HAHAHAHAHAHA!!‰  Nappa laughs and hits them away into the cement.  Nappa spots 
Goten and Trunks all scared.  Nappa flies down and lands near them.  Nappa then holds out his hands and 
prepares a blast.  Before he has a chances to fire the blasts, Piccolo and Olibu fly up and kicks him in the 
back very hard. Goten and Trunks run behind their mentors and Nappa retaliates with a giant blast.  Piccolo 
and Olibu block the blast with their bodies and after the smoke and dirt subside.  Piccolo and Olibu are still 
standing their, clothes torn.  They fall down and Goten and Trunks come to their aid.  „Go to Namek and 
wish us back.‰  Piccolo tells them and they give up the ghost and die.  „Nappa, you fool!!‰  Brolly shouts at 
Nappa.  „Why?‰  Nappa asks.  „You killed the Namek!  Oh well.‰  Brolly says.  Just then two figures 
appear before Nappa, Goten, and Trunks.  „Vageta.  Prince Kakoratte.‰  Brolly says with a smile.  Vageta 
and Gokou has finally arrived at the battlefield.  Pumped from training with Master Roshi.

-Chapter 7-</H3>

<P>„Last time on Dragon Ball XL:  Chapter 6.  Oh No.  The Sayjins has landed and they killed every single 
person in the city.  The Z Fighters arrive and their year of training proved little resistance to the Sayjin 
super powers as Guru predicted.  Yamcha has been killed by the evil Mecas, Tien died by trying to kill 
Nappa, and Choazu was killed by Nappa.  Piccolo and Olibu nobly was killed saving Goten and Trunks 
lives.  Now it‚s just Krillen, Trunks, and Goten but don‚t worry.  Vageta and Gokou has arrived finally.‰

<P>„Who are you guys.  It would have been better to stay back at your homes.  You would of died soon 
enough after we destroyed this dust ball.‰  Nappa confidently tells them.  „This „dust ball‰ is our home.‰  
Gokou calmly tells Nappa.  „And your not welcome here.‰  Vageta adds.  „Let‚s get at it.‰  Nappa tells 
them and charges at them.  „Nappa, you fool.  They are Vageta Jr. and Prince Kakoratte!!‰  Brolly yells at 
Nappa and Nappa looks back at Brolly in disbelief and back to Gokou and Vageta.  Nappa mouth opens in 
horror as he realizes it‚s them and how strong they are.  Nappa is then flung back into a near by skyscraper 
and Gokou and Vageta didn‚t even move.  Brolly looks back at Nappa and at them.  (My word, what 
power!)  Brolly thinks.  The skyscraper explodes and Nappa charges at the pair.  Nappa punches Gokou in 
the face and stops suddenly.  Nappa‚s mouth is wide open and blood is twinkling from his mouth.  Gokou‚s 
knee is in Nappa‚s gut.  Vageta pushes Nappa away and punches him in the face giving Nappa a broken 
nose and sending Nappa to Brolly‚s feet.  Brolly is gritting his teeth and looks at Gokou and Vageta.  
Brolly looks back down at Nappa.  „You were a fool, Nappa.  A weakling.  I can‚t believe you failed to 
beat up these low-levels.‰  Brolly mocks Nappa and lifts his head.  „Your not even worth a Sayjins death.‰  
Brolly tells Nappa.  Nappa‚s eyes open.  „Brolly. Forgive me.‰  He struggles to say.  „Shut up!‰  Brolly 
yells and at that, he crushes Nappa‚s head and skull like a pop cane which instantly kills Nappa.  
„WHAT!!!!‰  Gokou shouts.  „MY GOSH!!‰  Vageta yells as they cover their sons eyes.  Krillen stares in 
despair.  Brolly tosses Nappa‚s skull crushed body and shoots a Ki blast, vaporizing the dead Sayjin.  
Gokou and Vageta push their kids away and get in their fighting stances.  „Ahhh!!  So the battle has come 
down to this.  The fight of the Sayjins.‰  Brolly says.  Brolly charges at Vageta and Gokou.  Vageta and 
Gokou fires a Ki blast and Brolly emerges from the smoke, clotheslines the two.  Vageta punches Brolly in 
the face sending him into a statue, destroying it.  Brolly flies from the rubble and headbutts Vageta in the  
face but Gokou kicks Brolly in the jaw sending him into the air.  Gokou flies up.  „KAME∑.HAME‰  
Gokou yells as Brolly prepares to block. „HA!!!!!!!!!‰  Gokou yells and shoots a beam at Brolly.  Brolly 
blocks it and Vageta appears above Nappa and kicks him into a skyscraper.  Gokou and Vageta rush in and 
they start fighting, tearing the offices apart.  Papers, pencils, and office supplies are flying all over.  Gokou 
and Vageta punch Brolly in the stomach sending him through the window.  „YAAAAAAAAA!!!!!‰  Brolly 
screams at he throws a small pebble-sized energy ball.  Gokou and Vageta fly out of the office.  
„KAMEHAMEHA!!!‰  They yell as they shoot their combined Kamehameha‚s at Brolly‚s energy ball.  
The ball turns into a huge ball and Vageta and Gokou struggle with it.  „Vageta, Kaio-ken!!‰  Gokou yells 
at Vageta and Vageta nods.  Together they yell „Kaio-ken!!!‰ and their Kamehameha cuts through Brolly‚s 
blast like a hot knife through butter.  The beam streaks towards Brolly.  „What the∑!!‰  Brolly screams as 
he tries to block it.  Brolly using all his strength, lifts the Kamehameha, and sends it into the air.  Vageta 
and Gokou look at the Kamehameha as it‚s sent into the ionosphere.  „Let‚s make a deal.  Let‚s stop 
playing around.‰  Brolly tells Vageta and Gokou.  Gokou and Vageta smile and nod.  Brolly then powerups 
and his muscles expand and his power gets higher and higher.  Pretty soon, Brolly has increases in size by 
x4 and power has grown 10 fold.  „NO WAY!!!!‰  Gokou yells.  „Gokou, how can we beat him?‰  Vageta 
asks Gokou.  „Will the Kaioken work?‰  Gokou asks Vageta.  „Not the ordinary Kaioken for sure.‰  Vageta 
tells Gokou.  „Then let‚s crank it up a notch.‰  Gokou says as he smiles.  „But Master Roshi∑‰ Vageta 
says.  „Master Roshi nothing.  I know Master Roshi told us not to go above x3 but if we don‚t take the risk.  
We‚re done for.  Master Roshi would want us to do it.‰  Gokou yells back.  Vageta nods his head.  
„Kaioken!!!!  UGHHHH!!!  X5!!!!!!!!!‰  Gokou screams and Vageta does the same.  Brolly is pushed back 
and must shield his face from the light.  The muscles of the pair bulge out.  „NOW!!!‰  Gokou yells and 
charges at Brolly punching him hard in the belly.  Brolly tries to regain but is coughing up blood.  Vageta 
appears overhead and smashes his two hands on his back sending Brolly into a car.  Brolly sits up and looks 
at Vageta and Gokou, floating directly above him with a red aurora around them.  (How are they so strong.  
Even with my maximum power?  They seem 2 steps ahead of me!)  Brolly ponders, aching allover.  Brolly 
flies up and attempts to punch but Gokou knees him in the gut and Vageta grabs his head and knees it, 
sending him into a water tower.  Brolly grabs a metal pole and swings it Vageta and Vageta stops with his 
one finger.  Brolly throws away the pole and charges Vageta and punches him in the face, sending Vageta 
into the ground.  Vageta wipes away the blood and smirks.  Gokou flip kicks Brolly and kicks him back 
into a local inner-city swimming pool.  Brolly empties out the water and flies back up and Gokou but not 
until he gets a kick in the face by Vageta, sending him into a Gecko Supermarket.  „Let‚s go, Vageta!!‰  
Gokou yells as he fires hundreds of Energy Dans and Vageta follows suit.  The market explodes.  „Vageta, 
I think we just did it.‰  Gokou says happily but from the debris comes Brolly with a yellow aurora around 
him.  (Gokou, Vageta.  Watch out!!)  Master Roshi yells as he thinks with Vageta and Gokou.  (Brolly‚s 
rage has turned him into a Pre-Super Sayjin.)  Brolly looks up and smirks.  He flies up with such speed and 
strength at Gokou and Vageta are stuck with fear.  Brolly punches Gokou in the face sending him through 
several buildings and kicks Vageta into a hospital.  Brolly shoots two energy beams at Vageta and Gokou.  
Vageta and Gokou barely make it out of the rumble before the blast hits.  They both punch Brolly in the 
face but has no affect.  Brolly pushes them away with their energy, knocking them into the ground.  „How 
are going to∑.beat him?‰  Gokou asks Vageta out of breathe.  „I have no idea.‰  Vageta answers Gokou.  
Brolly charges down and punches Gokou in the face sending him 20 feet.  Brolly kicks Vageta in the side, 
sending him 20 feet, the other direction.  Gokou and Vageta then stand up and fly towards Brolly.  They 
punch Brolly but Brolly grabs both of their hands, squeezing them.  Brolly then throws then down on the 
ground and Brolly proceeds to hurt them by pushing his heels in their backs.  After some torturing, Brolly 
grabs them by their hair and slams their two heads together and throws them into Sunny Day Hotel lobby.  
Brolly walks in.  „I guess this isn‚t a sunny day for you two.‰  Brolly taunts.  „I‚m tired and bored off you 
guys.  Time to die.‰  Brolly tells them.  Vageta and Gokou are bent over on their knees and hands.  Brolly 
proceeds to kick them but when he kicks them, it doesn‚t do nothing.  Vageta and Gokou gets up at the 
same time and turn around.  Their pupils disappeared and white mist going over them.  Brolly is staring as 
their powerlevels soars and a yellow aurora surrounds them.  Gokou and Vageta has transformed to a Pre-
Super Sayjin.  With renewed and stronger power, they race towards Brolly and Gokou hits him in the jaw 
while Vageta hits him in the gut.  Brolly is sent streaking into the elevator.  Brolly, relaxing, rides the 
elevator.  A hand that explodes from the elevator ceiling and Gokou rips Brolly out and throws him upward 
and Vageta slams Brolly down back to Gokou.  Gokou punches him, sending him into a hotel room.  Brolly 
is badly injured and is normal and not Pre-Super Sayjin.  Vageta and Gokou walk in at Brolly.  „You killed 
our friends.‰  Vageta tells Brolly.  „You deserve to die.‰  Gokou adds.  „We are all Sayjins.  Why don‚t we 
join forces?‰  Brolly says, begging for his life.  Gokou and Vageta raises up there hands.  „You wouldn‚t 
kill a member of your own race.  We are a nomadic race since our planet was destroyed.  You guys, and me 
are the only full blooded Sayjins.‰  Brolly still begging for his life.  „Is that what you thought when you 
killed your comrade?‰  Vageta asks.  „Or when your friend was killing our friends?‰  Gokou asks.  Brolly 
ponders about it.  Gokou and Vageta yell and shoot two massive blasts.  „AHHHHHHH!!!!!‰  Brolly yells 
as he is being vaporized.  The other end of the hotel is vaporized from the blast.  After the debris settles, 
Gokou and Vageta find Brolly alive.  „Ha.  You may of permanently damaged by arm but I‚m alive.‰  
Brolly yells.  Gokou thinks for a second.  „Krillen, Goten, and Trunks.  Come here!!‰  Gokou yells and 
Goten, Trunks, and Krillen obeys.  „We can only defeat him by a combined Kamehameha.‰  Gokou 
explains.  Brolly spits and gets in a fighting stance.  Gokou, Vageta, Goten, Trunks, and Krillen chant the 
famous words and fire their combined Kamehamehas.  Brolly throws one of his super balls and stops the 
Kamehamehas.  „Kaioken X7‰  Gokou yells and Vageta does the same.  The Kamehameha pushes back the 
super ball and Brolly, weakened from the battle, is slipping.  Krillen, Goten, and Trunks then powerup to 
their max and that does it.  The super ball is vaporized and the beam hits Brolly.  Brolly is sent careening 
through space and smashes through Mercury, exploding it.  Brolly is then sent into the sun from there he is 
vaporized.

<P>This is the end of Dragon Ball XL:  Chapter 7.  Chapter 7 is part of the Sayjin Saga.  All characters were 
not created by me but the creators of the Dragon Ball series.  I do take credit for the plot of Dragon Ball XL 
and the development.  I did take the idea of this story by William Proctor .  Author of Another Dimension 
but twisted the idea a little.  

<H3 align=center>Chapter 8, coming soon.</H3>
