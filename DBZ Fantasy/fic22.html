<P>Well, I've bored you enough. On with the story. It takes place after the Freeza
Saga. Sometime right after the Nameks are wished to their new planet. If I get
support, I may continue the story. Thoughts are in `these` and speaking in
"these." Scene changes are horizontal rules like this:</P>

<a name="P1"><H3 align=center>Centa's Journey<BR>By: Gigasbolt<BR>Part 1</H2>

<P>It was a new day. The sun was shining and everything felt perfect. Well,
everything except that his father was missing. Gohan was still worried about his
dad. `Why hasn't he come back yet?` Gohan thought. He sighed, knowing he would
have homework to do without his dad to get him out of it.

<P>"GOHAN!!" The scream came as if to remind him of what he had just thought.
"YOU'D BETTER BE GETTING READY FOR SCHOOL!!!" Chi-Chi cared about her son. A
lot. That's probably why she wanted him to get such a good education. She didn't
want him to have to depend on fighting for everything. Like her husband. `How I
miss Goku... Even though he does eat everything in sight.. And he never thanks
me. That lazy, good-for-nothing. Always training. I can't believe it.` Her
thoughts were interrupted by the fact that Gohan was nowhere in sight.

<P>Gohan didn't want to go to school. He wanted to have fun. So, of course he had
put on his training gi, the one modeled after Piccolo's, and was climbing out
his window. Suddenly, Haiya Dragon flew up.

<P>"KKKRRRAAA" He shouted, obviously overjoyed that Gohan was joining him for a day
of fun.

<P>"Icarus, shush! Don't make any noise. I'm gonna skip school." Gohan shushed the
dragon, trying not to alert Chi-Chi.

<P>"GOHAN! YOU BETTER NOT BE GOOFING OFF WITH THAT BEAST!!! YOU'VE GOT SCHOOL!"
Chi-Chi began her ascent up the steps. She was sure that boy of her's was trying
to do something to get out of school. Ever since he got back from that planet
with Bulma and Krillen, all he wanted to do was goof off. `I bet Krillen was a
bad influence on him. What does Krillen do, anyways? All he does is train at
that pervert Roshie's house.`  "Humph. I'll have to give Krillen a piece of my
mind." Chi-Chi sure wasn't gonna give Gohan any excuse to goof off. She burst
through his door to find him on the roof, preparing to take off. "YOU STOP RIGHT
THERE, MISTER!" Chi-Chi had this thing about yelling today. She ran to the
window, hanging out and grabbing his leg. "You've got to go to school!"

<P>"But Mom... I wanna go play with Icarus!" Gohan pulled a little, but didn't want
to hurt his Mom.

<P>"Please, Gohan. Go to school for Mommy.. Please. I don't want you to grow up
without an education." Chi-Chi was pleading with her son. He coulnd't do this to
her.

<P>"All right..." Gohan didn't sound very excited, but Chi-Chi didn't seem to care.
She was too busy dancing around with glee. He came back in and got dressed for
school. `Man. I hate doing this.`

<P>"Oh, my little man is so cute." Chi-Chi pulled at his shirt, adjusting it to fit
just perfect. `Hmm.. That unruly hair is growing back. I'll have to schedule
another hair appointment.`

<P>Gohan walked towards the bus as his mother's voice was heard in the background.

<P>"BYE BYE GOHAN! HAVE A GOOD DAY!"

<P>"By Kami, she can be annoying sometimes." Gohan whispered to himself as he
climbed on the bus. He moved to the back, where he always sat by himself. His
was the last stop, and everybody knew it was his seat. He had claimed it from a
bully. After knocking him senseless with one punch, that is. He pondered on
taking Kami's name in vain, but then, he had met Kami, so it wasn't that bad.
And so he sat, the bus making it's way down the road until it stopped abruptly.

<P>"Hey, what's going on?" was the general question. Every child on the bus said it
or some version of it.

<P>One of the boys sitting near Gohan piped up. "Hey Gohan, I thought you were the
last stop. Anybody moved in recently?"

<P>"No, Johnny, not that I know of." Gohan had no idea who lived here. In fact,
none of the kids had even noticed the house until that time. As they watched, an
old man marched a little kid out to the bus.

<P>"Yeah, you brat. I'm finally gonna get rid of you. Hehehe.." The old man
laughed. He didn't live here. It was a front. The kid was an orphan he'd found,
and he didn't want the responsibility. He was gonna dump him on the bus and
leave. There was something about the kid, something unnerving. Maybe it was his
hair, the hair that changed color with his moods, staying green when he was
calm, his yellow eyes, or his unusual stature. The kid was 9 years old, but he
was only the size of a 6 year old. The eyes didn't help, either. The doctor's
had thought he would be blind, but he sees fine. `Better than fine.` The man
thought. This kid had seen flies land on food in the kitchens of other houses
from the street they usually lived on. The man thought he could cash in on it,
but the boy didn't want to do anything. At least, not anything the man tried to
force him to do. All in all, it wasn't worth the trouble.

<P>The boy looked at the bus, and saw kids his age. A glimmer of hope grew in him.
He'd never been allowed to play. The old man saw to that. He'd never been near
kids his own age. Maybe he could play with these kids. A memory from his very
early youth came to mind. He was young, around 2 years old, and he was back in
the orphanage. Before the man. He was playing with another baby, and
accidentally knocked it over. He was playing to hard, scolded the nurse. They
had never seen a toddler so strong. They didn't let him play after that. Then,
it closed down and the man found him. That was when he was 3. He could remember
all this. His reasoning skills, though he didn't know it, were far beyond his
age level. He'd lived with the man 6 years, growing smarter, stronger, faster.
And yet, as the man pointed out, not taller. He had reached this height when he
was 6 and hadn't grown any more. He climbed the stairs onto the bus.

<P>"Hey, look at him. He looks like a first grader! Are you sure he's on the right
bus!" A few troublemakers in the back began to make fun of the boy's height, but
Gohan knew some things didn't matter. Height was one of them. His dad's friend
Krillen was the same age as his dad, but Gohan was almost taller than Krillen. 
But, even though he was small, Krillen was one of the fiercest fighters he had
ever seen. Gohan knew not to judge people by how they looked, but by how they
acted.

<P>The boy looked at all the kids. He heard the jeers. He didn't pay attention to
them. If they didn't like him, their opinions didn't matter. He stepped to the
line between driver and children. He knew two things instinctively. The first
was that the man wouldn't be there at the end of the day. The boy didn't care
much. The man didn't love him, and he didn't love the man. The second, and the
more important, was that he had a friend on the bus. He didn't know who, and he
didn't know how, but the feeling was there. Someone here was willing to be his
friend. And not just any friend, but a close, personal friend. Someone who could
be trusted with anything. He walked forward, searching for a seat. Everywhere he
turned, the children either covered it up, saying it was taken, or just turned
him down. He finally reached the back of the bus. The last seat was next to a
boy with spiky black hair. He got the feeling again. Maybe this was his friend.

<P>Gohan looked up. The boy had made his way all the way back here. He looked
around. `Everyone else turned him down. I can't believe they did that. They're
so cruel.` Gohan looked into the boy's eyes. There was something about him that
reminded him of Dende. He looked hurt, yet trusting. `This boy is looking for
something.` Gohan realized. "Here, you can sit with me." Gohan moved over a
little and put his books into his bag.

<P>"Thank you very much." The boy bowed and put his backpack on the ground next to
him. He then sat and looked at Gohan. "What's your name?"

<P>"My name's Gohan. What's yours?"

<P>"It's Centa." The look of surprise was not very pronounced.

<P>"That's an odd name.. I've never heard of it before."

<P>"I made it up myself. I didn't like the name the orphanage gave me."

<P>"You're an orphan? That's too bad. Was that your adopted dad?"

<P>"No, that's some guy who found me. He took me in, but I don't like him. He's
mean."

<P>And so it went. Centa told Gohan the story of his life, as outlined earlier,
about how he started in an orphanage that ran out of money. It shut down and the
man found him. He raised him until that point. Nothing out of the normal had
ever happened in Centa's life, other than his looks and height. And his
strength. Centa didn't tell Gohan about that. He thought he'd be scared. If only
Centa knew. In fact, he would have known, because Gohan was about to start his
life story, when the bus pulled into the schoolyard. They got off the bus and
headed to their school room. They were surprised that Centa was in Gohan's room,
and they picked seats next to each other. Dende had been the only close friend
Gohan had had in a long time. And then he had to leave. Maybe Centa could take
his place.

<P>"All right, I know how interesting your conversation is, but Gohan, Centa. You
must stop talking while I talk." The teacher was driven to the point of making
them stand
outside when the bell rang. "OOH!! JUST EVERYONE GO OUTSIDE!!" All the children
raced out, while the teacher walked over to her desk and pulled out a bottle of
aspirin. She was about to take one, when Gohan and Centa stuck their heads back
in.

<P>"BYE TEACHER!"

<P>She then proceeded to throw the entire bottle of aspirin into her mouth,
swallowing every last one.

<P>"Heh, that was awesome, Gohan. We really freaked her out." Centa laughed as they
walked down to the playground.

<P>"That was great." Gohan was ready for some playing time after sitting down so
long. They threw the doors open, already the best of friends. As they walked,
Centa noticed a bully picking on a group of kids at the Jungle Gym. His hair
began to turn to a shade of orange as he got slightly angry.

<P>"Hey, Gohan. Do you see that?" Centa pointed.

<P>"Yeah, that's not nice. We should teach him a lesson, Centa." Gohan began
walking over there. He took a look back and noticed Centa's hair changing color.
He almost freaked, but then remember what his friend had told him on the bus,
about it changing colors like a mood ring. That just meant Centa was kind of
angry at the bully.

<P>`How did Gohan know that I could teach him a lesson? I'm sure I didn't tell
Gohan I was stronger than normal.` Centa, nevertheless, followed his new-found
friend towards the bully. Now, most of the bullies had heard of Gohan, but this
particular bully had either not been around long enough, or had just forgotten.
Bullies are kind of stupid, you know. So, he continued making fun of the kids
until he felt a tap on his shoulder.

<P>"Yeah, what do you want?" He turned, coming face to face with.. air,
surprisingly. He looked down, noticing Gohan, who was about 3 inches shorter.
Bullies usually are the bigger kids, too.

<P>"I want you to stop picking on them." Gohan said, matter of factly.

<P>"Who's gonna make me, YOU?" The bully pointed and laughed, but stopped when he
felt Gohan grab his finger. "HUH?" Gohan then proceeded to pick him up, turn him
over so that his head was facing the ground, and bring the aforementioned head
into the ground 4 to 5 times, leaving a massive bump. He then turned him
rightside up again and placed him on his feet.

<P>"You going to stop?" Gohan asked.

<P>"Yes... sir..." The bully replied, tears streaming down his face as he felt the
lump.

<P>"Good." Gohan said. He then turned and nearly run into a slack-jawed Centa.

<P>"How?.. Where?... When?.." Centa tried many interrogative sentences, but each
ended with the first word. Perhaps his hair conveyed the sentiment he was trying
to get off, as it was a confused white.

<P>"Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about myself, didn't I?" Gohan said, a bit
sheepishly. He then proceeded to launch into a vivid, if not child-like account
of his battles, starting with what he remembered from his 4 year old battle with
Radditz to his most recent battle on Namek with Freeza. There were a few
discrepancies between his account and what truly happened. From his point of
view, Piccolo, or "Mr. Piccolo" played a much bigger role, at one time going
from saving Gohan from being killed in the wilderness to having him defeat
Freeza only to have him come back from the dead when Goku arrived. Methinks
Gohan was just a bit confused on Namek. But, anyway, that really doesn't retract
from the importance of the stories Gohan was telling, does it? Centa certainly
didn't think so, as he stood. Then sat. And eventually lay, wrapped up in
Gohan's story so much he felt as if he were there. Gohan had just finished when
the school bell rang to come in. Wow, long break, huh? Anyhoo, they went back in
and continued their boring school day. Until lunchtime, that is...

<HR width="85%">

<P>"Hey, Centa. I'm going to the bathroom. Save my seat, okay?" Gohan stood up from
their table. It wasn't crowded. In fact, no one else was sitting there. Gohan
had a kind of reputation. But, to be nice, Centa put his feet up where Gohan was
sitting.

<P>"Sure, Gohan. I got it."

<P>"Okay, be back in a second." Gohan walked over to the bathroom. As soon as he
was gone, the hecklers from the bus walked over.

<P>"Hey, shrimp." The first said, pushing his feet aside and sitting in Gohan's
seat. He didn't seem to notice Centa's hair begin to shift into orange.

<P>"You can't sit there. Gohan's sitting there." Centa said, sticking up for his
friend.

<P>"You gonna make us move, shrimp?" The second said, sitting next to the first.
Centa's orange hair got a little redder.

<P>"If I have to." Centa answered.

<P>"HA! Yeah right!" The third said. He sat on the other side. None of them even
moved when Centa stood up and walked over to their side and put his hand, that's
right, one hand on their bench. His hair was now a bright, bright red.

<P>"Can't say I didn't warn you." He then proceeded to lift the bench containing
the bullies into the air, walked over to the garbage container, and dumped them
in. As he did, his hair began to turn back to green. Just as Gohan was walking
out of the bathroom.

<P>"CENTA! What're you doing?" Gohan was amazed that his friend lifted the bench
with one hand, let alone with three bullies on it.

<P>"Oh, hi Gohan. They took your seat. I told them to move, but they said to make
them. So I did. I figured now I don't have to hide stuff from you since you
didn't hide stuff from me." Centa then told Gohan all about how he was
different. When he was young, in the orphanage, he was as strong as the nurses.
When the old man found him, he was as strong as a bodybuilder. Now, he was very
strong, strong enough to lift small cars. Gohan was amazed. This was great! Not
only was his best friend cool, he was strong, too. Now they could train
together.

<P>"Centa, do you know anything about ki?" Gohan was hopeful. With power like that,
maybe he could do something.

<P>"No, I'm sorry Gohan. I've never heard that word before." Centa's hair was
turning white again.
<P>
`Oh well, I didn't know what ki was until Mr. Piccolo. I'm sure he can teach
Centa, too.` "Centa, I've got some people you should meet. Can you come with me
after school?"

<P>"Sure, Gohan. I don't have anything to do. The man abandoned me, so I don't have
anywhere to go." Centa didn't feel bad about it, as his hair showed by turning
green again, but Gohan obviously felt awful.

<P>"That sucks, Centa. Maybe you can live with me until you find someone to take
you in." Gohan was worried about his new friend. Maybe he could help him.

<HR width="85%">

<P>Later that day, after school was over, Chi-Chi recieved her introduction to
Centa. She checked her watch as the alarm went off. `Well, Gohan should be home
right now.`

<P>"HI MOM, I'M HOME"

<P>"Right on time. Gohan, I've got your favorite snack, cookies and.." She gasped,
catching her first view of a strange green topped body following Gohan through
the door. "GOHAN, SOMETHING GREEN IS FOLLOWING YOU!! I'LL GET IT!" Chi-Chi
grabbed her broom, about to start swinging, when Gohan broke in.

<P>"Mom, Mom. It's okay. If you'd look a little closer, you'd see that's my new
friend. His name is Centa. He's all alone, he's an orphan. Can he stay with us?"
Gohan looked at her with big, sad eyes. "Please?" He said, in that sweet voice
kids reserve for conning parents into something.

<P>"Well, that's a lot for me to process, Gohan. I'll think about it. Meanwhile,
I'll make a second set of cookies and a second glass of milk. Hello, Centa. I'm
sorry about before. It's just, you're so small, and I didn't look any lower than
your hair."

<P>"That's okay, Mrs. Chi-Chi. I don't mind. I've gotten worse reactions to me
before."

<P>`He seems like a good enough boy. Maybe I shouldn't worry about Gohan making
friends.` Chi-Chi thought, as she prepared the second snack. The boys had made
their way up to Gohan's room. She heard muffled sounds of laughter and a
strangely familiar KRARK. "OOH! THEY'D BEST NOT BE PLAYING WITH THAT... THAT...
ANIMAL IN THE HOUSE!" Chi-Chi hated cleaning up after that dragon, even if Gohan
loved him. She carried the tray up there, knowing she'd get a chance to lecture
Gohan, which she loved to do. She flung the door open. "Gohan, how many times
have I..??" She looked around, no sight of dragon.

<P>"Told me what, Mom?" Gohan looked up from the large bean-bag he and Centa were
laying on, shifting his weight. They turned the page on their comic book.

<P>"Um.. I thought I heard that dragon in here. I'm sorry to bother you. Here's the
snack. What are you boys planning on doing?" Chi-Chi asked, as she set down the
tray.

<P>"Yum!" Centa snatched two cookies and his glass of milk. He proceeded to make
the cookies disappear, and half his milk. He then stuffed some cookies in his
pocket, while sticking another in his mouth. He looked up, noticing the talking
had stopped as Chi-Chi and Gohan both stared at him. His hair began to change to
a sheepish pink color at his actions.

<P>"Centa, when was the last time you ate?" Chi-Chi asked.

<P>"Uhh... Let me think. I had something two weeks ago, but I haven't had cookies
since I was 3.." Centa answered.

<P>"What?? No cookies for 6 years?" Gohan was shocked. He had cookies every day.
And as a snack at night.

<P>"More importantly, you haven't eaten in two weeks?" Chi-Chi was worried. The boy
didn't look gaunt or hungry. But then, he was wearing a very baggy shirt. And
baggy pants.

<P>"No, ma'am. I wanted to eat at school, but they said I needed money. I didn't
have any." His hair, kind of like it had been blushing, finally turned back to
normal as he calmed down.

<P>"You poor thing. You boys are staying right here until I can pull together a
quick sandwich for Centa. And when you go, I'll give you a picnic to take with
you." Chi-Chi turned and headed back downstairs.

<P>Centa continued to eat until he finished his plate. He then drained his milk. He
reached into his pocket and fished out another cookie. "Your mom sure is nice,
Gohan."

<P>"Yeah, she is." Gohan reached for one of his cookies, when the bean-bag moved
and grabbed a cookie, too. "HEY! Icarus, I would've given you one."

<P>"AARK! KRAAKRAK!" Icarus told him, eating the cookie. Roughly translated, it
means. "Get off my back! My cookie!"

<P>"Okay, okay." Gohan rolled off and began punching the dragon playfully. Icarus
stood up and whipped his tail into him, knocking him back. Centa knew it was all
in good fun. As Gohan got back up, Icarus ate another cookie and dragon laughed
at Gohan.

<P>"AAK. AAK. AAK." Icarus laughed, pulling the cookie all the way into his mouth
and eating it.

<P>"Why you little.." Gohan tackled the dragon.

<P>"HAHAHA.." Centa laughed, watching Gohan and Icarus tumble around happily. His
hair turned yellow, matching his eyes in this hilarity. Suddenly, they heard
footsteps coming up. "Uh-oh. Gohan, can we hide him again?" Centa's hair turned
from yellow to a scared blue.

<P>"I don't think Icarus could hide in time." Gohan was about to throw a blanket
over him when Chi-Chi came in.

<P>"All right Centa, here's your.. GOHAN!! I knew that dragon was here! Get him
out!" Chi-Chi couldn't believe she'd fallen for the bean-bag trick. She shooed
the dragon out the window. She then handed the picnic lunch to Gohan and a
sandwich to Centa. "You two boys are full of mischief. Get outside and get some
sun. I've got to vacuum this room! Oh, and Gohan. I'd like it if you and Centa
visited Bulma and give her this for me." Chi-Chi handed the boys a small
package.

<P>"Okay Mom. Thanks!" Gohan ran to the window.

<P>"Um, Gohan. Why are you going to the window?" Centa asked, contentedly munching
his sandwich.

<H3 align=center>END PART 1</H3>

<HR width="85%">

<a name="P2"><H3 align=center>Centa's Journey<BR>By: Gigasbolt<BR>Part 2</H2>


<P>"We're gonna fly, Centa. Duh." Gohan jumped out the window. Centa gasped and ran
over, only to see Gohan floating in the air. His hair conveyed his shock as it
was a pale flesh color.

<P>"How'd you do that?" Centa was, once again, amazed by Gohan's actions. His hair
began to turn to its normal green again as he watched Gohan float.

<P>"You mean you can't fly?" Gohan asked. Centa shook his head no, and Gohan began
to think. Then, the answer came. "Come on, Centa, you can ride Icarus."

<P>"Well, okay." Centa walked to the window and watched as Icarus flew back for
him. Centa hopped on and grabbed onto his neck. "Ready, Gohan."

<P>"HERE WE GO!" Gohan took off towards the Capsule Corp. and Icarus followed close
behind.

<P>"WHOA! Gohan, this is amazing! I'm actually flying!" Centa watched the ground
rush by underneath him.  His hair turned violet as he looked down. All the
people walking around looked like ants. Centa watched them and laughed. Then, as
Icarus flew up some, Centa almost fell off.

<P>"Hold on tight, Centa." Gohan laughed. He remembered the first time he had gone
flying. He'd been just like Centa. Amazed, astonished, and really interested in
what was going on underneath him. Finally, they reached the place Gohan was
looking for. They set down in a large open area in front of a dome building.

<P>"Where are we, Gohan?" Centa looked on as Gohan walked to the dome building.

<P>"Oh, this is the Capsule Corporation. My Mom's friend, Bulma lives here. We have
to drop this off, remember?" Gohan held up the package.

<P>"Oh yeah." Centa stepped off Icarus's back and his hair began to turn green. The
giddiness of flying had worn off.

<P>"Come on." Gohan walked in and they found Bulma. "Hi, Bulma."

<P>"Gohan, oh hi. Who's your green haired friend?" Bulma walked over and tweaked
Centa's cheek. Of course, she had to bend over to do it, and as Centa got a
straight eye level view of Bulma's ample cleavage, his hair began to turn pink.
He was blushing again.

<P>"Oh hey, what's his hair doing?" Bulma asked. She felt the now pink hair, but it
felt the same. "How'd you do that?"

<P>"I don't know what's wrong with my hair, Mrs. Bulma. It's been like that since I
was born." Centa's hair turned green again as she stood up.

<P>"That's Ms. Bulma. And I'd like to study that, if you don't mind." She didn't
give Centa a chance to argue as she dragged him into her lab. Gohan followed
quizzically.

<P>"Okay, this won't hurt a bit.. I hope your skin is more permeable than
Vegeta's.. I broke countless needles on him until I found the right place. Then
I had all the Saiya-jin blood I needed." Bulma smiled, remember how she'd found
the spot. `"I don't need to give you Saiya-jin blood." Vegeta said, obnoxiously
as he sat. He then jumped back up screaming as he grabbed his butt in pain.
"What'd you sit on, Vegeta? Oh, how nice, a blood sample." Bulma picked up the
needle Vegeta had been kind enough to impale his butt on.` "Heh heh heh."

<P>"Bulma, what's so funny?" Gohan asked, as she swabbed Centa's arm.

<P>"Nothing Gohan. Now, hold still. Here we go." Bulma stabbed the needle into
Centa's arm. He didn't flinch, but his hair turned a shade of black. This
obviously meant pain, Gohan thought. But, it wasn't very dark, so he didn't
worry too much.

<P>"There we go.." Bulma pulled the analyzing computer over to her and stuck the
blood sample in. As the DNA code appeared, Gohan and Centa walked over and
looked, too. Centa's hair turned back to green as his arm stopped hurting.
"Hhmm.. That's strange."

<P>"What's wrong, Bulma?" Gohan asked.

<P>"Well, your friend there's got some blood in him that I can't identify. He's
mostly human, about 55% but there's another part in him. The other 45% is what
makes his hair change colors. Is there anything else different about him?" Bulma
finished her quick-scan and turned to the boys. She noticed Gohan looking around
and whistling; Centa was doing the same, but Centa's hair was a newly seen shade
of grey. "Centa, what does gray mean?"

<P>"Oh, that means that I'm telling a fib.. Oops.."

<P>"CENTA!" Gohan looked at him angrily, but Centa's hair betrayed his feeling's
again by turning pink.

<P>"Gohan." Bulma looked at him reproachfully.

<P>"Sorry. Centa's a lot stronger than a normal kid our age." Gohan answered her.

<P>"Let's see how strong." She popped out a capsule car and threw it down. Centa
then proceeded to lift it easily. "That's pretty strong. I'm gonna keep checking
this DNA for whatever I can find. Now then, why did you come here?"

<P>"Oh yeah. Here, Bulma. It's from my Mom." Gohan handed the package to Bulma and
she unwrapped it. It was a small earthenware pot Chi-Chi had made Bulma for her
collection.

<P>"Oh, thank you! You make sure you tell her I loved it."
Bulma waved good-bye to the boys and put the pot in her kitchen.

<P>"Where to now, Gohan?" Centa asked as they flew towards the forest.

<P>"We're going to see Mr. Piccolo." Gohan landed in a large clearing and Icarus
landed shortly afterward.

<P>"Hey, where's Icarus going?" Centa asked. Icarus had walked off just as Centa
got off.

<P>"He doesn't really like the person we're about to meet, so he goes off and
eats." Gohan got in the center and fired a large yellow beam into the sky.

<P>"GOHAN! How'd you do that?? It's so cool!!" Centa watched the beam go into the
air. Then, a big green guy came out of the woods behind Gohan. Gohan was to busy
looking at Centa and trying to explain what he did to notice. "GOHAN! LOOK OUT!"
Centa's hair began to change to a blue tint. Centa ran towards his friend as
fast as he could, launching himself into the air over Gohan and hitting the
green guy in the mouth. Apparently, he was caught off guard, and went flying
back into a tree. He got up, rubbing his jaw.

<P>"So, Gohan. Who's your little friend here?" Piccolo said, continueing to rub.

<P>"CENTA! YOU HIT MR. PICCOLO! He's the one we're here to meet!" Gohan turned from
reprimanding his friend. "I'm sorry, Mr. Piccolo. Centa didn't know who you
were."

<P>"That's okay, Gohan. He packs quite a wallop. Where'd you find him?" Piccolo was
interested in the small kid who'd accomplished something many people had a hard
time doing. He watched as the boy's hair changed from blue to green. The last
time he'd felt a punch like that was when Freeza hit him in Form 2. The kid had
potential. `Just like Gohan had when he was little,` thought Piccolo.

<P>"He came to my school today, Mr. Piccolo. He helped me take care of some bullies
and I thought he had potential. Except, he's never heard of ki." Gohan watched
Piccolo hopefully, but saw his face fall a little at that.

<P>"Well Gohan, I'm no Elder teacher. I can't start the kid with ki training. But,
I see great potential. Just like you had when you were little. How old is he?"
Piccolo had looked at the kid's height and was suprised to hear that he was
Gohan's age. "Gohan, I suggest you take him to Roshie's house. That old pervert
knows more about teaching ki than me. I use it better, but he'll learn what it
is from Roshie. After all, he didn't become the Turtle Elder for nothing."

<P>"You got it Mr. Piccolo." Gohan whistled for Icarus, and then had to go find
him. "That stupid dragon.. He never comes when I want him to. You stay here,
Centa." Gohan then ran off towards a fruit tree they'd passed earlier.

<P>"Kid, you've got potential. Your name's Centa, right?" said Piccolo.

<P>"That's right, sir. I'm very sorry. I didn't mean to punch you." Centa answered.

<P>"That's okay. When you get done with that loser Roshie's training, I'll give you
a real lesson." Piccolo winked at the boy, and flashed his canine teeth.

<P>"Centa! Come on!" Gohan dragged Icarus away from the tree, struggling all the
way.

<P>"AARRKK!!" Icarus screamed. Roughly translated, he said "GOHAN! MY FOOD!"

<P>"Oh shut up, you big crybaby. We've got an entire picnic basket of food.
Besides, I put some of that fruit you were eating in their too. Okay?" Gohan
said.

<P>"Aak." Icarus replied. Roughly translated, he said "Oh, Okay."

<P>Centa once again climbed on Icarus and they took off, both waving Good-bye to
Piccolo. After about two hours of flying, they finally spotted the Kame House.

<P>"Hey, it's Krillen." Gohan pointed at a glint of light moving around the house
rapidly.

<P>"Krillen is a glint of light? I got the impression from the story he was a
human.." Centa didn't understand his friend's reasoning. His hair was again,
white. They landed, and Centa realized what Gohan meant. The glint of light was
the sun reflecting off Krillen's head.

<P>"Hi, Krillen. This is my friend Centa. We're here to see Master Roshie. Centa
needs to learn about ki." Gohan explained Centa's history and what had already
happened. Krillen's jaw dropped when he heard Centa had belted Piccolo. He
looked at Centa, who's hair was going back to green after it's white look.

<P>"You hit Piccolo? Wow." That was all Krillen could say. "And to think, you're
shorter than me. Heh." Krillen was happy for that. He felt satisfied with his
height, but sometimes it was good to have somebody like him around. They entered
the Kame House, looking to wake Master Roshie up from one of his many naps to
begin Centa's training.

<HR width="85%">

<P>"YAWN! I hate all these weaklings." Gandono blasted another quick ki beam into
one of the little blue things. It died quickly, leaving the Ryodian with no
challenge for a fight.

<P>The Ryodian, a race where fighters were raised. Ryodians were a large part of
Freeza's army. They were strong, resilient, and loved to fight almost as much as
the saiyans. They usually topped out at about 500,000, but Gandono was a
prodigy. His power level had hit 500,000 and kept going. He was a secret
operative for King Cold and later Freeza. He was going to be next in line for a
spot on the Ginyu force, but they were destroyed by a supposed Super Saiyan.
Gandono didn't believe in the myth of a Super Saiyan, but then Freeza's body was
found. He had been released from service indefinitely, meaning he had quit when
the Ginyu were destroyed. He didn't want to be stuck as a low-level soldier. He
kept his special armor, and his scouter and personal space pod. The gold trim,
the silver inlaid plating, no wonder he kept the special armor. He now traveled
wherever there was supposed to be a challenge. His race had a large fin on the
top of their head, which looked like a mohawk hair-do, but was really what they
breathed with. Since it was a fin, they can breathe underwater and in hostile
environments, which made them good shock troops. Their skin was orange, their
pupils a distinct white, and their average height about 6 ft. No tail, humanoid
hand and feet, no body hair. Kind of like big reptiles or amphibians.

<P>Gandono breathed. `Where can I get a good challenge. My scouter measures me at
about 900,000. I want somebody in my league!` He casually blasted another small
alien running at his back into non-existence. `I think I'll try to find out
where the Super Saiyan was from.` He walked to his pod, getting in and plugging
his scouter into the computer. "Computer, please send out a power level search
for powers above 600,000." He waited as the ship flew through space. Eventually,
the computer beeped to get his attention. "Yes, computer?"

<P>"Sir, we've found a planet that may harbor powers off that magnitude. It's in
this galaxy, but very far. We estimate 5 months with no stops."

<P>`Well, well, well.` "Computer, we maybe stopping, but set course for this
planet." Gandono leaned back, preparing for a long trip. `I wager a good 8
months before I get there. Hell, maybe a year. There's still species to kill.`
The pod just flew silently, heading in the direction for Earth.

<HR width="85%">

<P>"EH.. WHAT?" Master Roshie was yelling, not realizing he had ear plugs in and
couldn't hear Krillen or Gohan. He thought they just weren't talking loud
enough. "SPEAK UP, KRILLEN!! DON'T BE SHY. WHO'S THE KID, GOHAN?"

<P>"MASTER ROSHIE!! TAKE YOUR EAR PLUGS OUT!!!" Krillen screamed. He couldn't
believe his former master. He was so absent-minded. He'd taken a nap, putting
ear plugs in. He had slept through Lunch sneezing and transforming, trashing the
entire house in her rage. She then sneezed again and cleaned up the mess. He had
only waken up after Krillen had turned an entire bucket of water onto his head.
He was now sopping wet and yelling at the top of his lungs.

<P>"EH?" Master Roshie began to feel his ears and discovered his ear plugs.
"KRILLEN, I'VE JUST FIGURED OUT WHY I CAN'T HEAR YOU OR GOHAN. I'VE GOT MY EAR
PLUGS IN!" Master Roshie began taking them out, as Krillen just fell to the
floor, twitching. He hopped back up, bowing to the elder. "All right Krillen.
What did you want to tell me about?"

<P>"Master Roshie, will you please teach young Centa here about ki? Just like you
taught me and Goku when we were little." Krillen hoped Master Roshie would go
along with the idea.

<P>"Eh.. Well, he'll have to go through the same thing that you and Goku had to
do." Master Roshie's glasses shone just like his eyes behind them. He loved this
part.

<P>"Master Roshie, you can't ask Centa and Gohan to bring you another maid.. You've
got Lunch." Krillen stated. This sounded pathetic to him, but Roshie bought it.

<P>"You're right, Krillen. They need another task. Hmm..." Master Roshie sat on the
couch and began to think of a task worthy of the world's most perverted man. Or
Elder, for that matter. He finally stood back up, surprising the three, who had
been talking about how they would get whatever it is he would ask for. "All
right, I've made my decision. You boys must bring me a picture of the most
beautiful girl in the town of Randis. It's got to have her... well, Krillen
knows. He'll help you if you need it." Master Roshie sat back down, giggling in
glee. He knew what they'd bring back.

<P>"Sigh.. All right, let's go." Krillen walked out, followed by Gohan and Centa.
The first two took off, Centa following on Icarus. They reached the town after
three hours of flight and they were all tired. They set down and saw suddenly
why Master Roshie loved this town's women. They were all beautiful. "THIS WILL
TAKE FOREVER." Krillen was angry with his elder for doing this.

<P>"I pick her." Centa pointed to a young woman with blonde hair.

<P>"Master Roshie will like her. Okay, guys. Here's the plan." Krillen, Gohan and
Centa huddled, ready to go through with the plan Krillen quickly outlined. Centa
and Gohan began following the girl. Krillen hung back a while. Centa had been
given Krillen's camera, which Krillen had gotten because Master Roshie gives
assignments like this. A loud scream was heard and Gohan came running back,
waving something around. A second scream was also heard, as Centa came
hightailing back waving the camera. While Gohan was relatively safe, Centa had
had to duck underneath her skirt while the underwear bandit made his break, so
Centa was being chased by a screaming, red-faced blonde. Who, at the moment, was
also throwing things from her purse at the group. Centa's hair was a strange mix
between bright pink and blue. They immediately took off, Krillen and Gohan
dragging Centa into the air because Icarus had bolted at the first scream.

<P>"YOU GUYS TAKE IT EASY, I CAN'T FLY!" Centa yelled, watching the ground with
eyes as big as saucers. Eventually, Icarus came back and allowed Centa to ride
it. "Icarus, you're a big baby." Centa told the dragon, who proceeded to turn
over and fly upside down, leaving Centa hanging on for dear life. "I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY." Icarus then let him back on. After the same boring flight back, they
arrived at the Kame House again. Centa's hair was just beginning to turn back to
normal.

<P>Krillen handed him the camera and he rushed off to his black room.. He came back
with a large cloth pressed to his nose and nodded at Gohan and Centa. "I'll
train you." He said, blood seeping through the cloth.

<HR width="85%">

<P>"All right, Centa. Ki is the power that gives you strength. You can use ki in a
variety of ways if it's strong enough. For instance." Master Roshie waved the
boys back and called Krillen over.

<P>"Yes, Elder?"

<P>"Krillen, I want you to prepare a Kamehameha. I will then block it with my own."

<P>"Yes, Elder." Krillen pulled his hands back, blue energy funneling into them.
The light began to shine through his hands as more and more ki was channeled in.
"KA....ME...HA...ME..HAAAAA!!!" The large blue beam raced through the air
straight towards Master Roshie.

<P>"All right, now then... KAMEHAMEHA!!!" Master Roshie, being the person who
created the move, barely needed to charge before he had a Kamehameha powerful
enough to deflect Krillen's into the ocean. "Now you see there, boys. Your ki
doesn't have to be stronger to beat someone. My power is nowhere near Krillen's,
but I am more experienced, and used my ki to deflect his. You just have to use
it more intelligently. Now, watch me do a Kamehameha like Krillen's." Master
Roshie whipped his shirt off, showing his... elderly phsyique. "KKAAAA...
MEEEE... HAAAA... MMMEEEE.. HAAAA!!" The Elder's body suddenly buffed out,
making him a match for any body builder. Then, just as suddenly, all the bulk
went into his hands as blue ki and he unleashed his Kamehameha. The attack was
so awesome Krillen barely had time to dodge before his mentor caused the attack
to soar right into the sky. "So you see, you can use your ki anyway you wish.
You just have to find it inside you and manipulate it. I can help you discover
it, but for more ki instruction, I recommend Yamcha or Tien." Master Roshie then
walked over to Centa and proceeded to grab his head and knee him in the stomach
several times, taunting the poor boy.

<P>"Stop (ow) that (ow) right (ow) NOW!!" Centa screamed the last word and as he
did, his anger unleashed a large ki aura that surrounded him. His hair stood up,
pointy black.

<P>"There you go.. Uh-oh..." Master Roshie had stopped but saw that Centa was still
very angry with him. He turned and ran behind Krillen, very sure that his
student could handle what the boy had.

<P>"YYYYAAAAAHHHH!!!" Centa just kept getting stronger. He could feel his power
growing the angrier he got. He raised his hands, holding each one in front of
his body and open palmed. Black energy, just like his hair and his ki aura began
to collect in the palm and around his hand. His hair stood on end as the energy
grew and grew. "SHITOKA!!" Centa screamed, having absolutely no idea where the
word had come from. But, whatever the case, it fit perfectly, because from each
hand a large, half-moon shaped beam shot at headed directly towards Krillen and
Master Roshie. Of course, after expending so much ki, Centa was drained and
couldn't prepare another attack if he'd wanted to.

<P>If Krillen had known what had happened to Centa, he wouldn't have been as
worried. But he could feel the power of the attacks coming at him and he was
scared senseless. The only thing he could do was to gather all the remaining
energy had had into a giant Kamehameha and hope that stopped it. Krillen quickly
flew his hands back, summoning all his ki. The blue ball quickly grew and
expanded to fill his cupped hands. "KAAAMEEHAAMEEHAAA!" He screamed, releasing
all his ki and aiming it directly at the two beams. The resulting explosion
rocked the little island, nearly toppling the Kame House.

<P>"My..my..my.. Centa, where did you learn that attack?" Master Roshie asked. He
stared at the young boy, not knowing what to say. The boy's burst in power had
raised his level exponentially. Master Roshie could feel it. `But, where did he
learn an attack like that?`

<P>"I don't know, Master Roshie. I just felt all this energy in my hands and that
seemed like a good word to say." Centa was bewildered by his power too. He had
no idea he had it in him. "Krillen, are you okay? I didn't mean to.." Centa's
hair was falling back down into place and turning into a slight blue tinted
green.

<P>"Yeah, Centa. I'm all right, don't feel bad. With a power like that, we should
train you. You'd be a strong force for good." Krillen looked towards Master
Roshie, and they both nodded. Centa was to begin training with Master Roshie
later that day. As Centa heard what was going to happen to him, his hair went
from the normal green to a shiny violet.

<a name="P3"><H3 align=center>Centa's Journey<BR>By: Gigasbolt<BR>Part 3</H2>

<P>"Mom.. Can you hear me?" Gohan asked. Apparently, they'd gotten a bad connection when 
Gohan called to ask if he could stay with Centa while he trained under Master Roshie.

<P>"Yes, Gohan. I can hear you. What is it you wanted?"  Chi-Chi answered. She was sure that 
her boy wanted to stay with Centa somewhere. `Just so long as they aren't staying with Piccolo.` 
She mused.

<P>"Mom, can I stay on Master Roshie's island with Krillen and Centa while Centa trains?"

<P>"Of course, sweetie. I trust Krillen to take good care of you boys. Will you put him on, please?"

<P>"Sure." Gohan turned. "Here Krillen, Mom wants to talk to you."

<P>"Huh? Me? Well, okay." Krillen got the phone and put it to his ear. "Hi, Chi-Chi. What's up?"

<P>"Now you listen here, Mister. You brought Gohan home safe and sound from Namek, but you'd 
better keep a good eye on those two, or else I might be forced to do something drastic." 
Chi-Chi had that stern voice she saved for occasions like this.

<P>"Um.. Yes ma'am." Krillen hung up the phone and sweatdropped.. A really big one. 

<P>"What'd she say, Krillen?" Gohan looked at Krillen  expenctantly.

<P>"Yeah Krillen, what?" Centa asked.

<P>"Well... SHE SAID TO HAVE FUN!!" The boys shouted with joy as Krillen sweatdropped again. He 
couldn't disapoint the boys, but Chi-Chi was gonna kill him when she found out.

<HR width="85%">

<P>"All right, time to begin Roshie's Turtle Training. I am your Elder, Master Roshie." Master 
Roshie was interrupted by the boys's giggling.

<P>"We know who you are, Master Roshie.." They erupted into laughter as Master Roshie sweatdropped. 
He hated going through all this formal stuff.

<P>"Well, anyway, let's get this training started." A few hours later, Centa has accomplished 
what took Krillen and Goku months to do. "I've never had so apt a pupil as you, Centa. You 
rival Goku's speed and power when he trained with me. Of course, you're a lot stronger than 
Goku was his first time here. But, anyways, your work here is done. No more training from me. 
You and Gohan can spend the night, and tomorrow I'm sending you to Yamcha. There, you will 
learn more about controlling and focusing your ki."

<P>"Good night, Master Roshie." The boys said. They deserved a good nights sleep after all that 
work. Master Roshie had made Gohan train alongside Centa, even though it didn't help Gohan 
that much.

<HR WIDTH="85%">

<P>The next morning, Gohan and Centa were up bright and early. They planned on flying to Yamcha's 
house since Centa could use his ki now. Of course, it would take longer because Centa wasn't 
used to it. But, it was a good workout. Centa began to power up, and once again the group 
noticed his ki was the color of his hair. If he was feeling fine and his hair was green, 
green ki. Pain, black ki and so on. Nobody really understood why, it was all the same ki. 
Although, Krillen and Gohan noticed when the ki was black or red it was stronger. Also, 
whenever Centa used his ki, there was a different twinge to it. They couldn't put their finger 
on it, but it felt different than their ki. He was on a different wavelength or something. To 
use an example, it was the same horse, but a different color. His ki was measured on a 
different scale. They flew through the air, Gohan concentrating on Yamcha's power level and 
Centa concentrating on keeping aloft. As they flew, they talked about how Centa's training was 
starting to take off. Eventually, they landed and found Yamcha. He was a bit taken aback by 
Centa's appearance, but nonetheless, agreed to teach Centa more about ki. Yamcha taught Centa 
more about how to manipulate ki. He used his ki to create a bomb of energy that he controlled. 
He then instructed Centa on how to do the same. As Centa learned, he became stronger than 
before. Gohan and Yamcha marveled at how much Centa's power was growing. He was going to be 
as strong as most of the Z fighters in a few days.

<HR WIDTH="85%">

<P>"HAHAHA!! This is the most fun I've had in weeks." Gandono laughed as he blasted the small 
aliens. He had landed on their planet and had found them to be very feisty. They all had the 
same power level, though. He had worked his way through village after village, leaving 
destruction in his wake. He could feel his power level rise. He had hoped he might find one of 
the refugees here, but to no avail. Apparently, those refugees were much better at hiding than 
they were at fighting, or so Gandono thought. Unbeknownst to him, great fighters from the 
refugee clan that he missed were sprouting up on planets very close to the one he was on. These 
refugees that Gandono despised so much were from a race that had opposed his own. They had lived 
on the same planet and struggled over power. The opposing race was similar to his own and was 
called Hadorians. That is, before they were wiped out. That's right, they were wiped off the 
face of their own planet. Gandono had pursued and killed many of the survivors, but everyone he 
had killed pointed to one more thing. There was another clan, one who Gandono had never fought. 
They were supposed to be exquisite fighters, but Gandono was sure he could stop them. If only he 
knew what was happening on Earth.

<HR WIDTH="85%">

<P>"YAAHHH!!" Centa screamed, powering himself up. His green ki swirled around him. Then, suddenly, 
as if out of nowhere, Tien appeared through the smoke. His leg was extended, aimed straight for 
Centa's chin. A fraction of a second passed, in which Centa was sent flying for a loop. The kick 
knocked him flat on his butt and flying backwards through a rock. Tien was much stronger than 
Centa had thought, but he wasn't giving up. He couldn't leave until he beat Tien, and he and 
Gohan had been here THREE days already. Whenever Centa would come close to winning, Tien would 
do the Multi-form Kikouhou and just put him back in the dirt. This time would be different.. 
Centa could feel it. His power was growing all the time. He could sense that now was when he 
should win. He stood up, shaking the dust from his body. 

<P>"Wha?? He's getting up? Impossible. I'll just have to finish him off." Tien began to power up, 
the ki flowing off his body. As he did so, he put his hands up to his face. "MULTI-FORM!!" He 
began to fade and suddenly, he split into many different versions of himself.

<P>"Gotta sense the right one.." Centa strained to sense the source of Tien's ki. They were images, 
but if he attacked the real one, they'd disappear. He raised his hands, the ki circling around 
him. It began to funnel into his hands.. As he powered up, only one word came to his lips. 
"Shitoka.." The two crescent beams shot from his hands towards Tien.

<P>"What!! He found the real me.. how could he.. AAAAHH!!" The two moons found their mark and Tien 
was the one on his butt.

<P>"YOU DID IT, CENTA!!" Gohan ran over and gave his friend a big hug. "That was awesome."

<P>"Thanks.. Now who do we go to?" The question was answered before Gohan could open his mouth. A 
green blur flew straight down, landing right behind the two boys. 

<P>"All right you two, get ready for some real training." The voice was easily recognizable, but 
Centa's hair still turned fleshly.

<P>"MR. PICCOLO!!" Gohan yelled. He ran to the tall Namek and hugged him. "I'm so happy to see you." 

<P>"Heh.. Maybe we can really unlock that power you've got Centa. Gohan, he'll be a very good 
sparring partner for you." Piccolo began to take off. Centa and Gohan floated into the air 
after him when Icarus suddenly flew up.

<P>"Arrk?" Icarus looked at the two boys.

<P>"Don't worry Icarus, we're just gonna go with Mr. Piccolo. You go home." Gohan explained to the 
little dragon. It flew off in the direction of the Son house. 

<P>"All right, let's go." Piccolo went speeding off in the direction of a Mountain Range off in the 
distance. Gohan and Centa followed after him.

<HR WIDTH="85%">

<P>"Guh.. hah... whoa.." Gandono was breathing much to hard. He couldn't understand it. He had 
landed on the small planet between Neptune and Uranus and had begun to search for powers when 
a Hadorian had appeared from the scenery. They had those stupid color change abilities, making 
it easy for them to blend in. This one had a clan symbol on that was un-like any one he'd ever 
seen before. It didn't matter to him to begin with, but then during the fight he had noticed he 
really had to try to keep the upper hand. Now he was totally tired and the Hadorian was barely 
winded. It began to power up again. `Where is it getting all this power??` Gandono only had one 
trump card left. He pulled his hands back, charging up. "MYODIE!" It shot out, homing in on the 
Hadorian and blasting it. A huge explosion occured. When it was over, only the upper half of the 
Hadorian survived intact. He walked over, looking at it. It spit into his face, showing it still 
lived.. for now.

<P>"Get... out... of here... YOU SCUM!!" The Hadorian screamed. Gandono laughed, further infuriating 
him. It seemed this Hadorian wanted to protect something close by. 

<P>"Who else survived, you pitiful weakling." Gandono demanded answers from the dying alien. It 
turned away, not answering. He then proceeded to crush the alien's head with his foot. "Oh well, 
you snooze, you lose. Heh." He took off, heading back for his space pod. As he flew up through 
the atmosphere, he powered up a fully-charged Myodie. He then released it into the planet, 
completely destroying it. His laugh echoed through space.

<HR WIDTH="85%">

<P>"All right, we're here." Piccolo landed in a small clearing in the woods. He turned to watch as 
the two boys landed behind him. He cracked his now famous.. or infamous demon grin at the two. 
"Now then.. Get ready."

<P>"Gohan, what does that.." The boy was cut off by Gohan powering up and flying to the side. 
"Wha...?" Centa was once again cut off, but this time by Piccolo's fist busting the poor kid 
in the face. Apparently, Centa didn't know what 'Get ready.' meant. Oh well, he's sure to learn, 
because this is all he'll be doing for the next few weeks or maybe months. Now.. let's take a 
little side trip, just for laughs...

<HR WIDTH="85%">

<P>"YOU DID WHAT!!!!!" Chi-Chi was holding poor Krillen by his collar, swinging him back and 
forth as she roared and ranted. She grabbed for a frying pan in Master Roshie's kitchen, but 
Krillen had hidden them all before she got there. Not to be stopped that easily, Chi-Chi 
managed to find a rolling pin, and began to swat the poor little man over the head. In doing 
so, she dropped her grip and he ran of screaming forgiveness.

<P>"CHI-CHI, PLEASE!! I DIDN'T KNOW THEY'D GO TO PICCOLO AFTER THEY WERE DONE!! DON'T HURT ME!!" 
`How does Goku put up with this woman...` Krillen thought, just as the rolling pin came flying 
after him, causing a giant bump to form on his head. "Waah..." Krillen cried, falling to the 
ground.

<P>Chi-Chi began her tirade again, speaking to the now unconscious Krillen. She was just winding 
down when Krillen began to show actual signs of life again. "And one more thing. If you ever... 
EVER... do something like this again, I will personally kill you." she said, with a certain 
state of finality. Krillen just nodded in agreement, having no idea whatsoever of the things 
she had said. 

<P>"Uh, right. Whatever you say Chi-Chi." Krillen rubbed his head, feeling the size of the bump.

<P>"Oh, hello there Chi-Chi. How are you?" Master Roshie walked in, completely oblivious to the 
scene that Krillen and Chi-Chi had just gone through.

<P>"Hello Master Roshie. I'm fine, thank you." Chi-Chi had to be civil, this was the man who had 
taught Goku how to survive after all. She nodded and smiled.

<P>"So, Chi-Chi. I figure you're here to find out about Gohan, eh? Am I right? Well, he's off with 
Piccolo again. I guess that kid just has no idea what you want for him.." Master Roshie began to 
laugh, having not the slightest idea what had just happened to Krillen. Chi-Chi was beginning to 
turn red, her anger building up again. We're gonna leave right now, but just take a listen. From 
inside the Kame House are the sounds of bones being broken and an old man crying in pain.. I think 
that's enough of that..

<HR WIDTH="85%">

<P>"C'mon, you can't stand in one place, move it!!" Piccolo was yelling out instructions to the boys 
as they dodged his attacks. He couldn't believe how they were progressing. Centa was already just 
as strong as Gohan, and they were both gaining in power now. Of course, they'd been here training 
for about 5 months now. `Time flies when you're training hard..` Piccolo thought.

<HR WIDTH="85%">

<P>"I can't believe it.. I've been having to stop at every planet in this solar system. Everyone has 
a Hadorian on it. How?? How did this many survive??" Gandono was on another planet, this one the 
largest of all the planets. It had a very gaseous nature, but he could handle the air supply. There 
was still one more Hadorian to be found on this planet. He had taken notice of the clan symbol on 
that first Hadorian and now he realized, everyone he had fought since then had that same symbol. 
He didn't completely recognize it, but he knew he had seen similar symbols on Hadorian Royalty back 
on the home world. `So, I'm chasing a band of royalty that somehow survived. Why do these things 
have to be so much trouble.` 

<P>"DIE, YOU BASTARD!!!" A Hadorian leaped from behind a cluster of boulders off to the side. Gandono 
had mistakenly left his scouter off, because it hadn't warned him.

<P>"Damn, he got the drop on me!" Gandono said, as the Hadorian was on him. It had the same clan 
symbol as before, but this one was much stronger. The two grappled, neither one of them faltering. 
Suddenly, the Hadorian stepped on a loose rock, causing him to lose his footing for a second. 
A second was all Gandono needed, for he unleashed a combo of devastating punches and kicks on 
the Hadorian. One punch aimed directly at the Hadorian's nose landed, crushing it into his face. 
Greenish blood oozed from the crushed mess. "Heh, guess you're not at strong as you thought, huh?" 
Gandono taunted.

<P>"You just wait.." The Hadorian replied, holding his face. "You've been fighting royal guardsmen up 
until now. But if you continue in the direction you're going, you'll be facing actual Hadorian 
royalty, and they are much stronger than us!" The Hadorian screamed the last part, rushing Gandono 
and wrapping his arms around him. The area glowed white for a minute, followed by a giant explosion, 
so powerful it decimated the surrounding land scape. Slowly, out of the rubble, one being emerged..

<P>"Shit.. I've never taken a beating quite like that.. It's a good thing that in my race, whatever 
doesn't kill us makes us stronger.." Gandono struggled over to his ship, getting in and setting 
the rejuvinator into place. He would stay in orbit around this planet until he fully healed. 
Then, he would continue his personal mission straight onward. He was finally coming closer to 
killing all the Hadorian race. He smiled as he drifted to sleep.

<HR WIDTH="85%">

<P>"All right you tenderfeet.. Let's get up and at it. You can't expect to sleep your training away." 
Piccolo grinned at the two drowsy little boys.

<P>"But Mr. Piccolo, it must barely be 5:00.. I'm tired." Gohan complained. He couldn't see how 
Centa could handle this, but it seemed he was up whenever Piccolo said up. `Oh well, at least 
I'm getting stronger..` Gohan thought. `That's worth whatever we have to go through.`

<P>"All right, today, I'm taking you two to a new training ground. I'm gonna leave you there. If 
you survive until I return, your training will be complete and you can begin sparring with me." 
Piccolo smiled that trademark smile. You know, the one that shows his canines just so... Anyway, 
the three companions lifted off, heading for wherever this place was. After a few hours of flight, 
they landed in a very cold and windy place.

<P>"Brr.. Piccolo, where are we??" Centa asked, shivering as he hugged himself, trying to get warmer. 

<P>"This is the ends of the world. Here, Kami crashlanded on earth. This was while we were still one. 
When we split, Kami lived here. I think it's what helped him. It's a harsh place to live, so stay 
on your lookout. I may be by to check up on you. Or maybe not!" And with those words, Piccolo 
rocketed into the sky, disappearing from sight.

<P>"Now what, Gohan?" Centa was just a little worried, off-set by his hair turning slightly blue-ish.

<P>"Don't be scared, Centa. This is just how Mr. Piccolo trains. He had me live in the wilderness a 
long time, and I turned out really strong, just like my dad." Gohan's experience calmed Centa down, 
and they both set out to search for suitable shelter. Centa spotted a nice looking cave, and after 
they kicked out the mountain lion who lived there, it was perfect to live in. Out of the winds 
that seemed to always be blowing, hollows for beds and shelfs. It was perfect. The two of them 
ventured out one more time before settling in, finding some leaves to make beds. That night, the 
two of them slept soundly.

<P>The next day started out rough for the two boys. This time it was them who were rousted from the 
cave, this time by a pack of mountain lions. They ran screaming over the hills. Then, they realized 
they were stronger than the mountain lions. They ran screaming again back towards the cave, only 
this time they screamed war-crys. By about lunch time, the lions were gone and the two boys had 
fur-skin beds. Much more comfortable. 

<P>"Gohan, I'm getting hungry. Can we go looking for some food?"

<P>"Sure, Centa. Let's go." They set off once again, this time in search of food instead of shelter. 
As they walked, Centa began to try to remember his childhood. Gohan had been very sentimental last 
night, telling stories about when he was young and how the Saiya-jin had come to earth and 
everything that had happened, and Centa wanted something to talk about to. Only he couldn't 
remember anything. So now he was racking his brain to find out what he knew about his past. They 
were rounding the top of the hill when one image shot into Centa's memory, seemingly out of nowhere.

<P>"Gohan.. GOHAN!!" Centa screamed, his hair turning extremly to an extremely flesh tone color. He 
then proceeded to pass out.

<P>"Centa.. Centa?? Oh no, what happened." Gohan grabbed Centa, taking him back to the cave and 
putting him in bed. `What could have done this?` Gohan sat by his friend, waiting for him to 
gain concsiousness. He had no idea what to do...

<a name="P4"><H3 align=center>Centa's Journey<BR>By: Gigasbolt<BR>Part 4</H2>

<P>"I wish Centa would wake up.. It's been 3 weeks, and I'm really worried." Gohan 
stayed watch over his friend, only moving to gather food to keep stocked up. Just 
a week ago, Gohan had begun to really worry, because Centa's hair color was starting 
to fade. It stayed in a normal green the first 2 weeks, then it began to change to a 
lighter green, and by today, it was almost completely clear. Gohan could feel Centa's 
ki being drained from.  It was as if Centa were slowly slipping into death. But, what 
Gohan didn't know, was that Centa wasn't slipping into death.. He was slipping into a 
new state of mind.
<HR width="85%">

<P>"Ggaaah.. What a feeling. I'm so glad that I'm finally healed again." Gandono was 
stretching as much as he could in the cramped space provided in his space pod. He 
twisted to scratch a particularly annoying spot. As he did, he turned in the direction 
of his computer scouter system, which was displaying a warning that was too outlandish 
to believe. 

<P>"WHAAAT!! That's... that's impossible.. The power level is past 1 million and still 
rising. It's a Hadorian, I know it." Gandono switched control over to himself and 
headed straight for the planet. It was red, whatever it was called. And he could tell 
that after this one, there was just one more planet to go.
<HR width="85%">

<P>"This.. this place. Where am I?" Centa looked around. He was on a strange looking 
planet. As he watched, aliens that looked strangely familiar walked through the city. 
As Centa racked his brain searching for where he knew these aliens, one in particular 
walked towards him. He was a large alien, about 7 feet 4 inches. He stopped in front of 
Centa.

<P>"Centa, do you recognize me?" The alien waited as Centa stopped his mulling and looked up.

<P>"How.. how'd you know my name?" Centa looked at the alien closely, and then realized it 
was the memory he had seen that day. The day when he had passed out. That's right, Centa 
knew he had passed out, but he couldn't control it. He had tried to come back to conscious, 
but he couldn't. It was as if a large glass barrier prevented him. And he wasn't strong 
enough to break through.

<P>"Centa, I see now you've recognized me. I'm your father. I know that you don't look like 
me, but I'm the source of your power. You see, Hadorians, that's what we are, reproduce 
differently than other races. Our offspring are passed into the female form using a type 
of telepathy. We send our genetic coding into the female body and the baby is conceived. I 
have taken part in your memory regression to explain the history of our race and your birth 
to you."

<P>"Dad.. It's amazing to finally meet you. I'd never even seen you before I got that memory 
image.. Where are you? Are you alive? On Earth somewhere?" Centa pleaded with his father. 
It was the first time he had even known he was alive.

<P>"No.. I'm on Mars. I'm out this far to protect you. An awful power is coming towards Earth, 
and I've contacted you to help you unlock your true potential." Centa's father stood. "Now 
come. We don't have much time before the evil lands on Mars. He's searching for me."

<P>As they walked, Centa took in all the sites of the city. "Dad, where are we?"

<P>"This is our home planet, Centa. I've recreated it here using my own memories." Centa's 
father looked down at his son and smiled happily. It was a little hard for a Hadorian to 
smile, because their mouths work like an insect's, but the effect worked.

<P>"Dad.. What's your real name?" Centa looked at his father questioningly.

<P>"It will be hard to prounounce, since you don't know the original language, but it's Quatxe. 
I would recommend you just call me Dad." Quatxe smiled as his son puzzled over the interesting 
word. 

<P>"I think you're right, Dad." Centa reached up and took his father's hand. Together, they 
walked down the street, quite an odd pair, seeing as how Centa is incredibly short and Quatxe 
is incredibly tall. But, no matter, because Quatxe turned and practically carried his boy 
over to a strange, temple looking building.

<P>"Son, this is where we will unlock your power." Quatxe told Centa where to stand. Centa moved 
to the center of the circle in the middle of the top room. There, he was instructed to power 
up as much as he could. As he did so, the moon of the planet neared its orbit over the temple. 
As it passed over, a large beam of moonlight lit up the temple room. 

<P>"DDAAAAADDD!!! WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME???!" Centa screamed. The light was magnifying his power 
greatly. He couldn't control it.

<P>"Don't worry son. This is completely natural. Once all Hadorians have reached the Age of 
Awakening, they go through this. This is the only way to unlock your true power." Quatxe was 
in the middle of another sentence when something strange happened to Quatxe. 

<P>"Dad? Dad!! What's wrong!!??" Centa cried in alarm. His father was bending over, holding his 
stomach.
<HR width="85%">

<P>"Heh.. You stupid Hadorian.. I've caught you in the middle of a trance." Gandono punched Quatxe 
again in the stomach. "I can't believe how damn easy this is gonna be. Why, you can't even 
protect yourself.. Hah, what an idiotic bastard." Gandono continued to punch.
<HR width="85%">

<P>"Centa.. The evil has arrived here.. Read the ancient text. Learn about us. I'm going to stop 
him. IT ENDS NOW!!" Quatxe screamed, disappearing from Centa's view. He'd left the dream. Centa 
couldn't sense him anymore. He walked over to the large tome his father had pointed out. He bent 
over, opening it to the first page. He read the few first pages about the Hadorians past, and 
how they had encountered a warrior race much like them on the same planet. The Ryodians. 
Something in the name aroused Centa's red aura of power. He already didn't like this race.
<HR width="85%">

<P>"Idiotic bastard, am I?" Quatxe said. He had plunged his hand through Gandono's chest as he 
stood laughing over Quatxe's body.

<P>"GACK!! You.. came out.. of the.. trance." Gandono was clutching the gaping hole in his chest. 
Blue blood was oozing out of the hole.

<P>"Damn right I did, you Ryodian." Quatxe spit the last word out like it was a piece of filth. He 
pulled back his hand, ki beginning to swirl around it in a red flower.

<P>"Oh no you don't!" Gandono leaped straight up, destroying the roof of the little hut Quatxe was 
living in. As he flew, he powered up a large amount of ki. He was gonna need it for the new 
technique he had discovered.

<P>"Shit.. He got away!" Quatxe leaped into the air after him. Large, insect wings buzzed, powering 
the Hadorian body through the air.
<HR width="85%">

<P>"Wow.. My dad.." Centa had just read a very interesting piece of information. His father was 
King of the Hadorians. Well, if they went by Earth's standards, he was a King. "That makes me.. 
the Prince of the Hadorians." Suddenly, Centa noticed a new, written note. It was from his father.

<P>'Centa,' His father's voice echoed as he read. 'I know that I will not survive this battle with 
the Ryodian. He is too strong for even me. But you, you can defeat him. continue your training 
on Earth and fight in the memory of your father and mother. I have left something for you.' 

<P>Centa turned the page to find a large, circular symbol. It seemed to graft itself on his mind, 
for Centa noted that he could describe it and remember it perfectly. It was the size of a large 
medal. It had a black circle outline. On the inside, was the Hadorian symbol for Q, which looked 
like |<: this. 

<P>'This symbol is the Hadorian royalty clan symbol. All the rulers of Hadorian have names that 
start with a Q. But, now that it goes to you, and you are the last of the Hadorian Race, I wish 
for you to add another symbol to the Clan mark. (*> is the Hadorian symbol for C, for you, Centa. 
I want you to add this to the side, for you and I will be side by side for all eternity, son. 
And now, I must leave you.' Quatxe's voice disappeared, leaving Centa alone and in tears.

<P>`I will Dad. I'll avenge your death and obey your wishes.` With this last revelation, Centa's 
true power was completely unlocked, and he was sent flying back to consciousness.
<HR width="85%">

<P>"Okay, the battle stops now!!" Gandono cried. He turned, widening both his hands all the way. 
Ki blasts flew from his hands in a criss-cross pattern towards Quatxe. Quatxe was caught off-guard 
by the abrupt change from prey-or to prey-ee and had no defense ready. The first strand caught 
him straight across the face, cutting in severely. He managed to dodge the second one, but his 
eyes were clouded by his own, Greenish blood. He clawed at his face, trying frantically to wipe 
his eyes clean before the next attack.

<P>"You wouldn't dare attack me in this incapacitated state!" Quatxe yelled. He didn't believe this 
for a minute, but he had a homing attack lined up and he needed the sound of Gandono's voice to 
lock in at least the general direction.

<P>"Oh, don't you think I won't!" Gandono cried, floating down behind Quatxe. He was about to blast 
him with a Myodie, when Quatxe let out an attack that looked like a large, red flower. It flew 
through the air directly at Gandono with the accuracy of a well-aimed arrow. He scrambled out of 
the way the first time, but the thing was locked onto him. "Hey.. How'd you get this thing to 
follow me?" Gandono flew through the air, only to meet Quatxe's foot. It was a good guess on 
Quatxe's part, because he had no visibility whatsoever. As he flew back through the air, Gandono 
pondered on whether the attack would catch him. No need to worry, the attack was streaking right 
towards Gandono's back. He landed on top of it, causing a giant explosion. His tattered body 
fluttered slowly to the ground.
<HR width="85%">

<P>"CENTA!!" Gohan yelled, jumping up and down on Centa's stomach. "YOU'RE ALIVE!!! I'M SO HAPPY!"  

<P>"Believe me, you're not the only one, buddy." Centa and Gohan exchanged a quick hug, but Centa 
had a purposeful look in his eyes, and Gohan sensed a deep hidden power in Centa. 

<P>`Wow.. what happened while he was gone?` Gohan thought. `That power could destory pretty much 
anything on the planet right now.. I'm glad he's bottling it up, I don't think even he can control 
it.`

<P>"Gohan, c'mon. We're leaving." Centa was walking to the door with a glint of orange tinging his 
hair. He was sort of mad about something.            

<P>"But Centa, our training isn't done.." Gohan protested, but Centa wasn't stopping, so Gohan 
followed. They lifted off and Centa, with a large green flash, was zipping straight towards 
Capsule Corporation.

<P>A spark set itself off through Piccolo's mind. "Hmm.." He looked off to see Centa flying off in 
one direction with Gohan barely keeping up. "Guess they decided their training was over." He 
grinned in that way he reserves for training little kids. "Well, we'll see what's so important. 
They've been here long enough." Piccolo took off, flying at his own pace after them.
<HR width="85%"> 

<P>"AAAAH!!" Gandono leaped to the side, letting Quatxe slam into the ground, producing the scream.

<P>`How is it that I can keep going?` Gandono thought to himself. He'd thought his body was wasted, 
that nothing could save him. But somehow, he'd found the inner strength to get back up and keep 
fighting. His hatred for the Hadorian race must be what's keeping him going. His condition was 
much worse than Quatxe's, but that could be remedied. "My..o..die!!" Gandono let the attack fly 
from his hands, circling Quatxe's body and tightening on it. 

<P>"Gah!! Release me, you bastard Ryodian!" Quatxe cried, his anger getting the better of him. 

<P>"Oh, don't worry, I will." Gandono was powering up a full Myodie, this one set to explode on 
contact with the first Myodie. `You just wait.. I'll kill you and then be done with the Hadorians 
once and for all.`
<HR width="85%">

<P>"Ms. Briefs!! Ms. Briefs!" Centa was running through Capsule Corporation searching for Bulma. 
He finally found her, working in her lab. He quickly outlined the medallion and the symbols he 
had seen in his dream.

<P>"Sure, I can make it. Where do you want it to be able to attach?" She asked. He pointed to his 
belt. "Oh, like a belt buckle.. I'll have it ready in about 2 days." She turned around and began 
to prepare the materials she'd need.

<P>"Thanks, Bulma." Gohan said. Centa walked out, contemplating something and Gohan followed. "What 
is it, Centa?" 

<P>"Doesn't Capsule Corporation make some kind of Gravity training device?" Centa asked. Gohan 
nodded. "C'mon, Gohan. That's where we will be training for the rest of the time we have." 

<P>`What does he mean, the rest of the time we have?? Oh well, I'll show him where the new one is.` 
Gohan and Centa made their way to the outer buildings of Capsule and found the 4th in the ship 
series that Dr. Briefs was building. They commandeered it, setting the gravity to 15 times Earth's 
gravity. Gohan wasn't to badly affected, but Centa was really pushing himself. It seems that Gohan 
still had a slight edge in power over Centa. But he could sense, if something were to push Centa 
over the edge, that hidden power would be uncontrollable.
<HR width="85%">

<P>"Hah.. I've finally got it. Now, 'King Hadorian', do you have any last words?" The words, 'King 
Hadorian' were spoken with great sarcasm. 

<P>"You won't be able to kill me without killing yourself.." Quatxe said. He was charging all his ki 
into his body. He planned on Kamikaze-ing when the second Myodie hit his body.

<P>"Yeah right.. I suppose after you, I won't have any more fun.." Gandono was searching Quatxe's 
face for any sign that there were more Hadorians.

<P>"I guess you are right." Quatxe said. He sighed in relief, knowing his son was safe.

<P>"Well, I'll just have to destroy Earth for the Hell of it then.." Gandono grinned.

<P>"NO, YOU STAY AWAY FROM EARTH!!" Quatxe cried, struggling to free himself from the Myodie's hold.

<P>"Oh, so there's one more on that planet? I'll be sure to get it. What is it, your offspring? 
I'll need something to prove my kill, then." Gandono floated down until he was right in front of 
Quatxe. He grabbed his clan symbol, ripping it off of his belt. He stuffed it into a pouch at his 
side. He then floated back up, preparing to destroy Quatxe with the Myodie.
<HR width="85%">

<P>Piccolo was hovering outside the window of the Capsule 4, where Gohan and Centa were training 
with a vengeance. "Well, well. What's lit a fire under these two?" Piccolo asked himself, 
rhetorically. He would stay there, making sure neither of them hurt themself. He had two sensu 
beans he'd 'borrowed' from Karin the last time they'd met.  The cat had been cranky for days 
finding out he'd been tricked.

<P>"C'mon, Centa. Take a break. We're gonna knock ourselves out, training like this." Gohan was 
pleading with his friend.

<P>"Gohan, I made a promise during my dream. I hadn't told you yet, but I saw and met my father 
during that time. His name is Quatxe, and he's from another race. He's a Hadorian, and so am I. 
They can change colors to blend in with their surroundings, and my hair color changes. It's a 
genetic defect that got passed over when my mom's genes met my dad's. But, in the dream, my dad 
said he was gonna die." Centa had to take a moment to compose himself. "And that there is a 
really strong evil coming to Earth. He's fighting it right now, and I don't know if he can win." 
Centa was in tears. "And.. *sniff* I promised to win, to avenge my father in this next fight." 
Centa had broken down, his hair turning blue. Gohan recognized that it was in sadness, not fear. 
He couldn't believe this was happening to his friend. To have found and lost your father all in 
the same day had to be horrible. A tear came to Gohan's eye as he imagined the same thing possibly 
happening to Goku.
<HR width="85%">

<P>"MYODIE!!" Gandono screamed, loosing the awesome power straight towards Quatxe's body. As he 
did so, his scouter sensed another giant ki from inside Quatxe. `What is he doing.. he's powering 
up and.. Wait a minute, he said something about not being able to kill him without killing..` 
"HE'S GONNA KAMIKAZE!!" Gandono immediately took off in the direction of his ship, putting a ki 
shield around him. The explosion that followed rocked the planet, destroying all the surrouding 
area. Gandono's ki shield broke as he flew, and the waves of power that the site exuded flung him 
to the ground. His right arm and left leg had been turned into a bloody pulp, and his chest was 
still bleeding from the large hole. His ki was completely depleted, giving him just enough to hang 
onto life. He crawled on his hands and knees to his ship. Luckily for him, the crater his ship 
creates whenever it lands protected it from the waves of ki that spread from the explosion. He 
managed to climb in before he passed out. The computer lowered the rejuvinator onto his face. 
It set it's course on auto-pilot to Earth.

<P>"I wish Centa would wake up.. It's been 3 weeks, and I'm really
worried." Gohan stayed watch over his friend, only moving to gather food
to keep stocked up. Just a week ago, Gohan had begun to really worry,
because Centa's hair color was starting to fade. It stayed in a normal
green the first 2 weeks, then it began to change to a lighter green, and
by today, it was almost completely clear. Gohan could feel Centa's ki
being drained from.  It was as if Centa were slowly slipping into death.
But, what Gohan didn't know, was that Centa wasn't slipping into death..
He was slipping into a new state of mind.

<HR width="35%">

<P>"Ggaaah.. What a feeling. I'm so glad that I'm finally healed again."
Gandono was stretching as much as he could in the cramped space provided
in his space pod. He twisted to scratch a particularly annoying spot. As
he did, he turned in the direction of his computer scouter system, which
was displaying a warning that was too outlandish to believe. 

<P>"WHAAAT!! That's... that's impossible.. The power level is past 1
million and still rising. It's a Hadorian, I know it." Gandono switched
control over to himself and headed straight for the planet. It was red,
whatever it was called. And he could tell that after this one, there was
just one more planet to go.

<HR width="35%">

<P>"This.. this place. Where am I?" Centa looked around. He was on a
strange looking planet. As he watched, aliens that looked strangely

<P>"I think you're right, Dad." Centa reached up and took his father's
hand. Together, they walked down the street, quite an odd pair, seeing
as how Centa is incredibly short and Quatxe is incredibly tall. But, no
matter, because Quatxe turned and practically carried his boy over to a
strange, temple looking building.

<P>"Son, this is where we will unlock your power." Quatxe told Centa where
to stand. Centa moved to the center of the circle in the middle of the
top room. There, he was instructed to power up as much as he could. As
he did so, the moon of the planet neared its orbit over the temple. As
it passed over, a large beam of moonlight lit up the temple room. 

<P>"DDAAAAADDD!!! WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME???!" Centa screamed. The light was
magnifying his power greatly. He couldn't control it.

<P>"Don't worry son. This is completely natural. Once all Hadorians have
reached the Age of Awakening, they go through this. This is the only way
to unlock your true power." Quatxe was in the middle of another sentence
when something strange happened to Quatxe. 

<P>"Dad? Dad!! What's wrong!!??" Centa cried in alarm. His father was
bending over, holding his stomach.

<HR width="35%">

<P>"Heh.. You stupid Hadorian.. I've caught you in the middle of a trance."
Gandono punched Quatxe again in the stomach. "I can't believe how damn
easy this is gonna be. Why, you can't even protect yourself.. Hah, what
an idiotic bastard." Gandono continued to punch.

<HR width="35%">

<P>"Centa.. The evil has arrived here.. Read the ancient text. Learn about

from Centa's view. He'd left the dream. Centa couldn't sense him
anymore. He walked over to the large tome his father had pointed out. He
bent over, opening it to the first page. He read the few first pages
about the Hadorians past, and how they had encountered a warrior race

gaping hole in his chest. Blue blood was oozing out of the hole.

<P>"Damn right I did, you Ryodian." Quatxe spit the last word out like it
was a piece of filth. He pulled back his hand, ki beginning to swirl
around it in a red flower.

<P>"Oh no you don't!" Gandono leaped straight up, destroying the roof of
the little hut Quatxe was living in. As he flew, he powered up a large
amount of ki. He was gonna need it for the new technique he had
discovered.

<P>"Shit.. He got away!" Quatxe leaped into the air after him. Large,
insect wings buzzed, powering the Hadorian body through the air.

<HR width="35%">

<P>"Wow.. My dad.." Centa had just read a very interesting piece of
information. His father was King of the Hadorians. Well, if they went by
Earth's standards, he was a King. "That makes me.. the Prince of the
Hadorians." Suddenly, Centa noticed a new, written note. It was from his
father.

<P>'Centa,' His father's voice echoed as he read. 'I know that I will not
survive this battle with the Ryodian. He is too strong for even me. But
you, you can defeat him. continue your training on Earth and fight in
the memory of your father and mother. I have left something for you.' 

<P>Centa turned the page to find a large, circular symbol. It seemed to
graft itself on his mind, for Centa noted that he could describe it and
remember it perfectly. It was the size of a large medal. It had a black
circle outline. On the inside, was the Hadorian symbol for Q, which
looked like |<: this. 

<P>'This symbol is the Hadorian royalty clan symbol. All the rulers of
Hadorian have names that start with a Q. But, now that it goes to you,
and you are the last of the Hadorian Race, I wish for you to add another
symbol to the Clan mark. (*> is the Hadorian symbol for C, for you,
Centa. I want you to add this to the side, for you and I will be side by
side for all eternity, son. And now, I must leave you.' Quatxe's voice
disappeared, leaving Centa alone and in tears.

<P>`I will Dad. I'll avenge your death and obey your wishes.` With this
last revelation, Centa's true power was completely unlocked, and he was
sent flying back to consciousness.

<HR width="35%">

<P>"Okay, the battle stops now!!" Gandono cried. He turned, widening both
his hands all the way. Ki blasts flew from his hands in a criss-cross
pattern towards Quatxe. Quatxe was caught off-guard by the abrupt change
from prey-or to prey-ee and had no defense ready. The first strand
caught him straight across the face, cutting in severely. He managed to
dodge the second one, but his eyes were clouded by his own, Greenish
blood. He clawed at his face, trying frantically to wipe his eyes clean
before the next attack.

<P>"You wouldn't dare attack me in this incapacitated state!" Quatxe
yelled. He didn't believe this for a minute, but he had a homing attack
lined up and he needed the sound of Gandono's voice to lock in at least
the general direction.

<P>"Oh, don't you think I won't!" Gandono cried, floating down behind
Quatxe. He was about to blast him with a Myodie, when Quatxe let out an
attack that looked like a large, red flower. It flew through the air
directly at Gandono with the accuracy of a well-aimed arrow. He
scrambled out of the way the first time, but the thing was locked onto
him. "Hey.. How'd you get this thing to follow me?" Gandono flew through
the air, only to meet Quatxe's foot. It was a good guess on Quatxe's
part, because he had no visibility whatsoever. As he flew back through
the air, Gandono pondered on whether the attack would catch him. No need
to worry, the attack was streaking right towards Gandono's back. He
landed on top of it, causing a giant explosion. His tattered body
fluttered slowly to the ground.

<HR width="35%">

<P>"CENTA!!" Gohan yelled, jumping up and down on Centa's stomach. "YOU'RE
ALIVE!!! I'M SO HAPPY!"  

<P>"Believe me, you're not the only one, buddy." Centa and Gohan exchanged
a quick hug, but Centa had a purposeful look in his eyes, and Gohan
sensed a deep hidden power in Centa. 

<P>`Wow.. what happened while he was gone?` Gohan thought. `That power
could destory pretty much anything on the planet right now.. I'm glad
he's bottling it up, I don't think even he can control it.`

<P>"Gohan, c'mon. We're leaving." Centa was walking to the door with a
glint of orange tinging his hair. He was sort of mad about something.   
        

<P>"But Centa, our training isn't done.." Gohan protested, but Centa wasn't
stopping, so Gohan followed. They lifted off and Centa, with a large
green flash, was zipping straight towards Capsule Corporation.

<P>A spark set itself off through Piccolo's mind. "Hmm.." He looked off to
see Centa flying off in one direction with Gohan barely keeping up.
"Guess they decided their training was over." He grinned in that way he
reserves for training little kids. "Well, we'll see what's so important.
They've been here long enough." Piccolo took off, flying at his own pace
after them.

<HR width="35%">

<P>"AAAAH!!" Gandono leaped to the side, letting Quatxe slam into the
ground, producing the scream.

<P>`How is it that I can keep going?` Gandono thought to himself. He'd
thought his body was wasted, that nothing could save him. But somehow,
he'd found the inner strength to get back up and keep fighting. His
hatred for the Hadorian race must be what's keeping him going. His
condition was much worse than Quatxe's, but that could be remedied.
"My..o..die!!" Gandono let the attack fly from his hands, circling
Quatxe's body and tightening on it. 

<P>"Gah!! Release me, you bastard Ryodian!" Quatxe cried, his anger getting
the better of him. 

<P>"Oh, don't worry, I will." Gandono was powering up a full Myodie, this
one set to explode on contact with the first Myodie. `You just wait..
I'll kill you and then be done with the Hadorians once and for all.`

<HR width="35%">

<P>"Ms. Briefs!! Ms. Briefs!" Centa was running through Capsule Corporation
searching for Bulma. He finally found her, working in her lab. He
quickly outlined the medallion and the symbols he had seen in his dream.

<P>"Sure, I can make it. Where do you want it to be able to attach?" She
asked. He pointed to his belt. "Oh, like a belt buckle.. I'll have it
ready in about 2 days." She turned around and began to prepare the
materials she'd need.

<P>"Thanks, Bulma." Gohan said. Centa walked out, contemplating something
and Gohan followed. "What is it, Centa?" 

<P>"Doesn't Capsule Corporation make some kind of Gravity training device?"
Centa asked. Gohan nodded. "C'mon, Gohan. That's where we will be
training for the rest of the time we have." 

<P>`What does he mean, the rest of the time we have?? Oh well, I'll show
him where the new one is.` Gohan and Centa made their way to the outer
buildings of Capsule and found the 4th in the ship series that Dr.
Briefs was building. They commandeered it, setting the gravity to 15
times Earth's gravity. Gohan wasn't to badly affected, but Centa was
really pushing himself. It seems that Gohan still had a slight edge in
power over Centa. But he could sense, if something were to push Centa
over the edge, that hidden power would be uncontrollable.

<HR width="35%">

<P>"Hah.. I've finally got it. Now, 'King Hadorian', do you have any last
words?" The words, 'King Hadorian' were spoken with great sarcasm. 

<P>"You won't be able to kill me without killing yourself.." Quatxe said.
He was charging all his ki into his body. He planned on Kamikaze-ing
when the second Myodie hit his body.

<P>"Yeah right.. I suppose after you, I won't have any more fun.." Gandono
was searching Quatxe's face for any sign that there were more Hadorians.

<P>"I guess you are right." Quatxe said. He sighed in relief, knowing his
son was safe.

<P>"Well, I'll just have to destroy Earth for the Hell of it then.."
Gandono grinned.

<P>"NO, YOU STAY AWAY FROM EARTH!!" Quatxe cried, struggling to free
himself from the Myodie's hold.

<P>"Oh, so there's one more on that planet? I'll be sure to get it. What is
it, your offspring? I'll need something to prove my kill, then." Gandono
floated down until he was right in front of Quatxe. He grabbed his clan
symbol, ripping it off of his belt. He stuffed it into a pouch at his
side. He then floated back up, preparing to destroy Quatxe with the
Myodie.

<HR width="35%">

<P>Piccolo was hovering outside the window of the Capsule 4, where Gohan
and Centa were training with a vengeance. "Well, well. What's lit a fire
under these two?" Piccolo asked himself, rhetorically. He would stay
there, making sure neither of them hurt themself. He had two sensu beans
he'd 'borrowed' from Karin the last time they'd met.  The cat had been
cranky for days finding out he'd been tricked.

<P>"C'mon, Centa. Take a break. We're gonna knock ourselves out, training
like this." Gohan was pleading with his friend.

<P>"Gohan, I made a promise during my dream. I hadn't told you yet, but I
saw and met my father during that time. His name is Quatxe, and he's
from another race. He's a Hadorian, and so am I. They can change colors
to blend in with their surroundings, and y hair color changes. It's a
genetic defect that got passed over when my mom's genes met my dad's.
But, in the dream, my dad said he was gonna die." Centa had to take a
moment to compose himself. "And that there is a really strong evil
coming to Earth. He's fighting it right now, and I don't know if he can
win." Centa was in tears. "And.. *sniff* I promised to win, to avenge my
father in this next fight." Centa had broken down, his hair turning
blue. Gohan recognized that it was in sadness, not fear. He couldn't
believe this was happening to his friend. To have found and lost your
father all in the same day had to be horrible. A tear came to Gohan's
eye as he imagined the same thing possibly happening to Goku.

<HR width="35%">

<P>"MYODIE!!" Gandono screamed, loosing the awesome power straight towards
Quatxe's body. As he did so, his scouter sensed another giant ki from
inside Quatxe. `What is he doing.. he's powering up and.. Wait a minute,
he said something about not being able to kill him without killing..`
"HE'S GONNA KAMIKAZE!!" Gandono immediately took off in the direction of
his ship, putting a ki shield around him. The explosion that followed
rocked the planet, destroying all the surrouding area. Gandono's ki
shield broke as he flew, and the waves of power that the site exuded
flung him to the ground. His right arm and left leg had been turned into
a bloody pulp, and his chest was still bleeding from the large hole. His
ki was completely depleted, giving him just enough to hang onto life. He
crawled on his hands and knees to his ship. Luckily for him, the crater
his ship creates whenever it lands protected it from the waves of ki
that spread from the explosion. He managed to climb in before he passed
out. The computer lowered the rejuvinator onto his face. It set it's
course on auto-pilot to Earth.

<H3 align=center>END PART 5</H3>
<HR width="85%">

<a name="P6"><H3 align=center>Centa's Journey<BR>By: Gigasbolt<BR>"The Finale."</H2>

<P>"GrrrrrrrrAAAAAH!!!!" Centa screamed, his eyes completely blanking out.
His budy bulged with muscle and he gained a few inches in height. He
looked completely different from the scared little boy that had arrived
on the bus that first day. He was stronger, taller, and much more
confident. He had his hands back in the Kamehameha style. A green ball
appeared in his hands, then expanded to fill them. Light sprayed out of
it in a cascade of green. He narrowed his eyes and directed his stare at
Piccolo. 

<P>"Bring it on, Centa. It's time to see what all this training has really
done for you." Piccolo had joined Centa and Gohan for the last training
bout. Gandono was going to arrive on Earth within two days, and all the
Z Fighters were preparing for a tough time. Goku still hadn't come back
from his training, Vegeta was off doing his own thing, Tien and Chaotsu
were training by themselves and Yamcha wasn't going to be any help
anyway. The Capsule 4's gravity had been increased, and Centa, Piccolo,
and Gohan were all training at 50 times Earth Gravity. Piccolo had taken
off his weighted training clothing, but Centa and Gohan still had
their's on. He was moving quite fast and was now just waiting for Centa
to make a move.

<P>"Shi....Tok....AAAHH!!!!" Centa screamed. He pushed the his hands
forward and one huge crescent moon fired from his cupped hands. It was
the new and vastly improved version of the original. It was much
stronger.

<P>"Not bad... Not bad at all." Piccolo commented, then raised his own
hands. A ball began to form in it, then he fired it at the Shitoka. He
smirked as he watched his attack hit Centa's. Then, suddenly, the smirk
left his face. His own attack was easily overpowered and Centa's shot
hit Piccolo in the stomach, sending him flying backward into the wall of
the Capsule. Piccolo grunted and stood up. Centa powered back down to
normal and landed on the floor.

<P>"Wow, Centa. That was great. You really got Piccolo good." Gohan walked
over and clapped Centa on the back.

<P>'The kid's strong.. Much stronger than he should be... What's happened
to him...' Piccolo didn't have time to consider his thoughts much more,
because a huge power level had just broken through Earth's atmosphere.
Everyone in the ship started at the power.

<P>"My Kami..."

<P>"The time has come." Centa said, in a steely voice.

<P>"What? What do you mean?" Piccolo growled out.

<P>"Yeah, Centa. We usually leave the cryptic messages to Mr. Piccolo."

<P>"Hey!" While Piccolo and Gohan burned each other mercilessly, Centa
walked over to the Capsule door and opened it. He stepped out and burst
into green ki. He shot off into the air.

<P>"Centa! Wait!" Gohan raced to the door, looking out after his friend.
Right before he took off to follow, Piccolo stopped him.

<P>"Gohan, wait. We're going to let Centa do this himself." Piccolo looked
on as Centa flew. `This'll be a hard fight.`

<HR width="35%">


<P>A large explosion occured in the middle of Brown Town. Right in the
middle of downtown, killing thousands. And at the source of that
explosion? That's right, Gandono. The villian. He was just causing
wanton destruction. He didn't really care what he destroyed, it was all
good. "Pitiful humans. Bullets can't hurt me." 

<P>One cop shouldered his flame thrower and fired.

<P>"OW! All right, you little bastard. That's it, playtime is over!"
Another huge explosion rocked the buildings, killing even more people.
Who could stop this madman? 

<P>"Wait, what's that? Up in the sky!"

<P>"It's a bird."

<P>"No, you idiot. Birds fly by flapping their wings, not by leaving trails
of Green Energy."

<P>"Oh, sorry."

<P>Centa landed in the crater that Gandono had just created. Gandono's
scouter bleeped and he looked up from the cop he was holding. The one
with the flame thrower.

<P>"Put him down." Centa was cool and calm.

<P>"Why? He burned me." Gandono didn't know who this kid was, but something
about him was familiar.

<P>"Do as I say, villian." Yeah, pretty lame, but Centa was in such a bad
mood, it didn't matter.

<P>"All right.. I'll put him down. But first, I'm gonna kill him." Gandono
looked at the man, then put two fingers into his mouth. They slowly
began to glow, then a large ki shot fired from them. It went through the
back of the man's throat and skull. As the blood poured out of the hole
in the back of the man's head, Gandono gently set him on the ground. 

<P>"Happy?"

<P>"You... bastard... I'LL KILL YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO ME AND MY
FAMILY!!" Centa took off, his ki suddenly becoming black along with his
hair. He slammed into Gandono and began throwing rapid punches and
kicks, which Gandono was only barely able to dodge.

<P>"What? What did I ever do to you.... Oh.. You're him! You're the kid
prince! Well, kid, I killed your daddy, mommy and everybody else. I
don't see why I can't kill you!!" And with that, Gandono landed his
first blow, and what a mighty blow it was. A large elbow to the back of
Centa's head, knocking him nearly un-conscious.

<P>"Heh.. Stupid little shit... Too busy attacking to block. Oh well, I was
hoping for better, but I didn't get it. My.. O.. DI-*COUGH.. COUGH*"
Gandono clutched his chest, then pulled his hand back. It was stained
with blood. `My blood.` He looked around wildy for the person who had
drilled this hole in him.

<P>"You think you can just pick on innocent boys? Not while I'm around."
Piccolo leaped off of a nearby building, landing on the ground. It was
the patented Screw Beam of the Devil, special delivery. Without further
banter, however witty it may be (Not while FUNimation is around),
Piccolo proceeded to show Gandono his superiority. Unfortunately, it was
not such an easy task, for even with a hole in his chest, Gandono was
fighting surprisingly well, blocking most attacks and landing a few of
his own. It was shortly in the first encounter when Gandono pulled out a
surprise that stopped Piccolo cold.

<P>"HA!" Piccolo laid a large chop onto Gandono's shoulder, and he faltered
and fell to the ground. "There.. Maybe now I've shown you the evil of
your ways. But, just in case I haven't, prepare to die."

<P>"Oh, I don't think so, Namek." Gandono coughed up some blood, then
looked at him with an evil grin. Suddenly, his body bulged and grew to
twice its original size. His muscles expanded and his power skyrocketed.
He pushed up off of the ground and looked at Piccolo.

<P>"Wha... What?!" Piccolo's mouth dropped open, but he quickly caught
himself.

<P>"Well, Namek. It's kinda like Regeneration. Only, all my energy is
returned and I get a lot stronger." Gandono stretched and cracked his
joints. Then, in one swift move, he landed an elbow in Piccolo's ribs
that would have broken a normal man, or Namek, for that matter. Piccolo,
however, was only greatly incapacitated. He lay on the ground, gasping
for breath. It was quite obvious his ribcage had been shattered.

<P>"Now.. Prepare for death. What the?" The last cry was elicited by the
fact that Centa was standing back up, and he looked pissed. His hair was
black and spiked up all over the place, and his body crackled with black
lightning. His eyes narrowed and then blacked out entirely. He screamed,
and when he did, the ki rose off his body in waves, knocking Gandono
down and leveling the rest of Downtown Brown Town (Quite a mouthfull, to
say the least).

<P>"No. You prepare for death." Centa began to walk forward, each step
causing destruction in the town. Waves of ki continued rolling off of
his body, causing cracks in the pavement with each step. Gandono looked
on, quivering with fear. His scouter exploded on his ear. He had never
felt or seen such power. He had to move quickly. He began a suicide
charge. He collected all his energy, pushing his body to the maximum. He
was going to kill one of them, or die trying.

<P>"Stay back.. I'm warning you. I'm gonna kill us both." Gandono was
glowing a brilliant white-orange now. His body was overloading.

<P>"PICCOLO!!" Gohan had finally arrived. He had gotten worried and come
after his mentor. He picked up his body.

<P>"Gohan, get out of here. I'm going to kill him and you can't get caught
in the after burn." 

<P>"What? Centa, no.."

<P>"HA! I'll kill him myself!" Gandono lifted a hand to release some of his
ki.

<P>"NO!" And with that, Centa released his anger. He flew forward and
slammed headfirst into Gandono. "SHITOKA!" The rapidly charged attack
was just enough. A huge explosion occured, sending Gohan and Piccolo
flying backwards.

<HR width="35%">


<P>"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the passing on of
someone we all loved deeply..." The preacher continued on as Gohan,
Piccolo, Goku, Chi-Chi, and Bulma sat in the back of the room. Gohan was
crying, while Chi-Chi tried to comfort him.

<P>"Gohan, son. It'll be all right. You know Centa will be in Heaven. And
he doesn't want to be wished back. The Dragon said so."

<P>"Yeah, I know. He's with his dad. I hope he doesn't mind me not saying
Goodbye."

<P>"Of course not, kid. Centa knows you would if you could." Piccolo, of
course. 

<P>"For the short time he was here, I had a true friend." Gohan reflected.
He and all the rest left that day, a little bit somber, but better for
what Centa had done for them. He had saved Earth while Goku was gone. He
would be remembered forever.
