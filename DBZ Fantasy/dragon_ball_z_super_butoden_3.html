::Revision History::
Final Version – Added some ASCII art, and the whole top of the page is 
different. Plus, I have discovered grappling maneuvers in Super 
Butouden 3, and added that under the basics. This will probably be the 
last time I update it, so of course the version is FINAL.

Version 1.1 – Very minor update. Added another e-mail address, just 
because I need another one for GameFAQs solely, but I also left the 
other one. Also, A site requested my FAQ posting, so a new and very 
small section about that legal stuff was made.

Version 1.0 – Made the FAQ. Added the basics, along with everything for 
Goku, Vegita, Trunks, Gohan, Goten, Android 18, Buu, Dabura, and Kaio-
shin.

*What is Dragon Ball Z: Super Butouden 3?
  DBZ Super Butouden 3 is the third installment of a series of Dragon 
Ball one-on-one fighting games. It was only released in Japan, France, 
and Korea in 1994 from Bandai for the Super Famicon. It was never 
released in America. Therefore, there is no available way to play this 
in English unless someone translated a ROM. However, you really don't 
need to know any of those languages to actually play this game.

--------------------------


*Basics

A button: Standard "ki" blast. Also known as an energy blast.
B button: Kick
Y button: Punch
X button: Fly up into the air/come down from the air
Forward: Walk/float forward
Back: Walk/float backward/block
Up: Jump
Down: Duck
L button: Rush to the left
R button: Rush to the right
Y + B buttons: Charge up Ki bar

The ki bar is needed to do any attack with the use of ki. Be aware that 
super ki blasts take up a large amount of ki from the bar, so make sure 
that you have plenty of the bar filled up. If the bar runs low, your 
character may stop and take a breather for a couple of seconds, leaving 
him/her vulnerable for that amount of time.

*Super Blast duels
If you and your opponent both let out a super Ki blast at the same 
time, a super blast duel occurs. To win this, you must continually 
press the A button as fast as you can. The first person to press the A 
button a certain amount of times wins the duel, therefore hits the 
opponent with his/her blast.

*Grappling Maneuvers
A big new thing into Super Butouden 3 was the grappling system. When 
two characters are caught running toward each other and they connect, 
they will start to grapple. When this happens, press: Forward + Down, 
Up + Back, Y. This will cause your character to perform their grappling 
maneuver. Each maneuver is different for every character, in terms of 
the animation.

Character Guides

*Note: Any move with a = instead of a – is a super blast. Any move with 
a # means it is their Super Meteo attack.

Little Bio:
Goku is the main man of Dragon Ball Z. From the beginning of Dragon 
Ball as a little boy, to the end of GT as a 48 year old man, most 
things are based around his adventures.


Unique Attack List:

- Spinning Kick
How to perform: Back, Down, Forward, B
Description: Goku swings around, kicking the opponent. If you're in 
their face, you can kick them up to six times.

- Dive Kick
How to perform: [While in the air] Forward, Down, B
Description: Just live it sounds. He comes down at a 45 degree angle 
and smacks 'em in the face. Good for catching your enemy off-guard.

- Dash Kick
How to perform: Forward, Back, Forward, B
Description: Goku flips forward, hitting the opponent twice. Not bad, 
really.

- Renzoku Energy Dan
How to perform: Down, Forward, A
Description: Goku fires of 3 regular Ki blasts. But because of their 
speed, if one hits, the other are guaranteed to. (Unless they fall)

= Kamehameha
How to perform: Back, Down, Forward, A
Description: The trademark move. Must I explain? Like all super blasts, 
this one is great.

= Cho Kamehameha
How to perform: Down, Back, Forward, A
Description: Just like the first, but stronger since Goku powers up 
first. It's better than most super blasts.

# Meteo Smash
How to perform: Back, Down, Forward, Up, B
Description: Goku grabs the opponent, throws them to the other side of 
the screen, then punches and kicks the crap out of him/her. Then, he 
teleports to the other side of them, and launches a ball of energy at 
them. Takes good damage, and cool to watch, but it's too hard to do in 
the midst of a battle.

Little Bio:
Vegita is a Saiya-jin prince. He originally came to Earth for the 
Dragon Balls, so that he can gain immortality. However, on Namek, some 
twists make him slowly come onto the good side, although he is always 
untrustworthy. In this game, he has an M on his forward and is referred 
to as Majin Vegita, since Babidi possesses him.


Unique Attack List

- Renzoku Energy Dan
How to perform: Down, Forward, A
Description: Vegita throws 3 quick Ki blasts. He seems to throw them 
much faster than anyone else, so it's better than the others.

- Rushing Combo
How to perform: Forward, Back, Forward, Y
Description: Vegita punches the opponent, then follows up with a knee 
shot and two kicks. Good combo, plus you can kick him/her at the end by 
yourself.

- Explosion Wave
How to perform: Down, Up, A
Description: Vegita causes a blast to come out from underneath the 
opponent. Takes too long for it to be of any use, though.

- Elbow Drive
How to perform: Down, Forward, Y
Description: Vegita rushes forward with his elbow as if he's about to 
nail the opponent, but instead goes around to their other side, and 
THEN nails them. Very good for catching the opponent off guard.

= Big Bang Attack
How to perform: Back, Down, Forward, A
Description: Vegita holds his hand with his palm straight out, then 
fires a powerful ball of energy. Nice.

= Final Flash
How to perform: Down, Back, Forward, A
Description: Vegita cups his hands, forms a ball of energy, then lets 
out a huge blast. Very nice.

# Galactic Gunfire
How to perform: Forward, Down, Back, Forward, Y
Description: Vegita smacks the guy in the air, and fires off tons off 
blasts, just keeping them hung up their. Then he uppercuts him/her and 
finishes 'em off with a Big Bang attack. A great attack, and fun to 
watch.

*Future Trunks is the secret character found in Dragon Ball Z Super 
Butouden 3.

Little Bio:
Future Trunks is the Trunks that came from the future to warn the gang 
about the coming androids, and then comes back to help fight them. 
Later, Chibi Trunks is born in the present. He is the son of Vegita and 
Buruma, and has the ability to go SSJ, like Future Trunks.


Future Trunks Unique Attack List:

- Rushing Combo
How to perform: Down, Towards, Y
Description: Trunks leaps forward with two punches, a kick, and 
finishes it off with an uppercut. Very good, since you can end it by 
juggling around the character yourself.

- Energy Zan
How to perform: Back, Down, A
Description: Trunks throws Ki down at the ground and travels toward the 
enemy and hit them in the legs. Nice for those pesky guys who like to 
duck.

- Slide Kick
How to perform: Hold Down, and press B
Description: Trunks does a short, slow slide along the ground. Not very 
useful.

- Force Attack (Bakukan-ha)
How to perform: Hold back for 2 seconds, Forward, Y
Description: Trunks shoots his hand out and knocks the opponent flying. 
It's terrible, though, because they have to be very close.

- Triple Blast (Kakusan Energy Dan)
How to perform: Down, Towards, A
Description: Trunks shoots three small ki balls, parallel to each 
other. A lot better than just a regular Ki attack. (A)

= Finish Buster
How to perform: Back, Down, Forwards, A
Description: Trunks waves his hands around, trying to look cool, and 
then fires off a blast. Like all special Ki blasts, it's pretty good.

= Burning Attack
How to perform: Down, Back, Forwards, A
Description: Trunks makes a big ball of energy, than throws it down at 
the opponent, better and better looking than the Finish Buster.

# Tornado Crusher
How to perform: Forward, Back, Down, Up, Y
Description: Trunks punches the opponent, flies back a bit, then 
unleashes about 20 very quick blasts, and jumps up and kicks then in 
the face. Sounds great, huh? Well, it would be if you didn't have to be 
so close.


Chibi Trunks Unique Attack List

- Jump Kick
How to perform: Forward, Back, Forward, B
Description: Trunks jumps forward and spin kicks the enemy. If he 
connects with both kicks, he'll follow up with one more kick. Pretty 
good, although it's hard to hit the opponent all three times.

- Sonic Punch
How to perform: Back, Down, Forward, Y
Description: He dashes forward a bit, and lets out six ultra fast 
punches. However, it's tough to hit them all six times; they have to be 
backed into a corner. But it's very good... I use it all the time.
- Saulting Kick
How to perform: Down, Forward, B
Description: Trunks does a backflip while kicking the opponent in the 
face. I find this one pretty useless, since you have to be so close to 
the enemy.

- Kakusan Energy Dan
How to perform: Down, Forward, A
Description: Trunks lets out three ki blasts. However, unlike the 
Renzoku Energy Dan, these blasts are let out all at once, one hovering 
over the other. It's okay, I guess.

= Kikoha
How to perform: Back, Down, Forward, A
Description: Trunks gathers some energy behind his back, then lets it 
go. Nice, but doesn't seem as good as most other super Ki blasts.

= Kiaiho
How to perform: Down, Back, Forward, A
Description: Just like Future Trunks's Burning Attack, but much 
smaller. But don't be fooled, it packs a lot.

# Spirit Rush
How to perform: Forward, Back, Down, Up, B
Description: Trunks flips upside-down and kicks the opponent in the 
head numerous times. And just when you think it's over, he knocks them 
flat with a Kiaiho. Nice, because it's easy to do and fast.

Little Bio: Gohan is Goku and Chi-Chi's first son. After the battle 
with Raditsu, he is trained by Piccolo, and really looks up to him. He 
even tries to be like him by wearing similar clothes. He has amazing 
potential, and is the first Saiya-jin to go SSJ2. However, he never 
gets past that level, since he spends most of his time with his studies 
after that.


Unique Attack List

- Flying Kicks
How to perform: (In the air) Forward, Down, B
Description: Gohan unleashes a round of kicks to the opponent while 
floating in the air. Very useful, nice for catching your enemies off 
guard.

- Jetting Uppercut
How to perform: Down, Forward, Y
Description: Gohan rushes forward and hits the opponent with a nice 
uppercut. I've never found it very useful, but it's still pretty good.

- Punch Rush
How to perform: Forward, Back, Forward, Y
Description: Gohan rushes up to the opponent and unleashes some 
punches, hitting them up to six times. Quite a good combo.

- Renzoku Energy Dan
How to perform: Down, Forward, A
Description: Just like all the others, Gohan shoots three quick Ki 
bolts. And also like all the others, it's pretty good.

= Masenko
How to perform: Back, Down, Forward, A
Description: His trademark maneuver, Gohan powers up some Ki over his 
head, and then fires it off. Just an average super ki blast.

= Kamehameha
How to perform: Down, Back, Forward, A
Description: Just like Goku's. Does a pretty high amount of damage.

# Gekiretsu Rush
How to perform: Forward, Down, Back, Forward, B
Description: Gohan punches and kicks his opponent furiously, and kicks 
them away. To finish things off, he launches a Kamehameha at them to 
finish them off. Good, and pretty easy to pull off.

Little Bio: Goten is the second son of Goku and Chi-Chi. He was born 
after Cell was killed, and resembles Goku very much. He is also best 
friends with [chibi] Trunks. He shows great power when he turns Super 
Saiya-jin at the age of seven.


Unique Attack List

- Renzoku Energy Dan
How to perform: Down, forward, A
Description: Goten fires off three quick regular Ki blasts. It's your 
average, quick-to-use attack.

- Power Knee
How to perform: Forward, Back, Forward, B
Description: Goten flies forward and smacks the oppenent with his knee. 
If it connects, he will follow up with a high kick. It's nice, because 
it's fast and easy to use.

- Spike Launcher
How to perform: Hold back [2 sec], Forward, Y
Description: Goten barrels forward surrounded with Ki, and knocks out 
the opponent. Holding back is a pain, but otherwise nice.

- Super Uppercut
How to perform: Back, Down, Forward, Y
Description: Goten twirls his arm around for a second, then unleases a 
huge uppercut. If you're in their face, you'll end up hitting them by 
swinging your arm, and missing the uppercut. Unfortunately, you leave 
yourself open while you are swinging your arm around, so it's not too 
useful.

= Energy Ha
How to perform: Back, Down, Forward, A
Description: Goten powers up some ki over his head, then shoots it one-
handed at the opponent. It's your basic super ki blast.

= Kame Hame Ha
How to perform: Down, Back, Forward, A
Description: Basically Goku's Kamehameha, but the name is messed up 
since he's just a little kid. Slightly better than the Energy Ha, it's 
[,again,] your basic Ki blast.

# Response Rush
How to perform: Back, Down, Forward, Up, B
Description: Goten grabs the opponent, throws them, punches and kicks 
them, punches him/her in the air, and knocks them down with a headbutt. 
Fun to watch, hard to do. Nuff said.

Little Bio: Dr. Gero created Android 18, along with Android 17. 
However, Cell came along and eventually absorbed them both, because 
Kururin fell in love with her and refused to destroy her. However, a 
severe blow to Cell caused him to regurgitate No. 18, and she and 
Kururin eventually get married.


Unique Attack List

- Triangular Kick
How to perform: Forward, Back, Forward, B
Description: #18 comes back a little bit, then hops up-forward, and 
comes down-right at a 45 degree angle with a kick. Not too useful, as 
many times the opponent can easily dodge this.

- Slap Attack
How to perform: Forward, Back, Forward, Y
Description: #18 swings her arm out, attempting to hit her opponent 
with the back of her hand. If she connects, she will continue to slap 
them silly, and then give them the final slap that knocks them away. 
Not bad, and it's fun to watch.

- Keinzan (Destructo Disc for all of you American DBZ fans)
How to perform: Down, Forward, A
Description: #18 charges a small, flat energy disc over her head for 
about one second then throws it. It tracks the opponent, although it 
can be dodged. Nice, since it homes in on the target. I like to use it 
a lot.

- Flying Butt Attack
How to perform: Down, Forward, B
Description: #18 jumps like she does in the Triangular Kick (except 
without moving back), but instead of kicking the opponent, she assumes 
a sitting position and smack then on the head. Looks like E. Honda from 
Street Fighter... but he was big and fat. ^_^

= Ki Ball
How to perform: Back, Down, Forward, A
Description: #18 charges a ball of energy in her fist, then lets the 
ball fly. I guess it's okay, but it doesn't do as much damage as you 
might like.

= Ki Wave
How to perform: Down, Back, Forward, A
Desciption: #18 starts out by powering up, then letting out a huge 
Kamehameha sized energy wave. Very good, what you would expect from a 
blast that big, and makes up for the not-so-good Ki Ball.

# Uh-oh!
No, that's not the name of the attack. As far as I know, there is no 
Super Meteo attack for Android #18. If there is, I don't know it. 
Sorry!

Little Bio: Buu is a demon created 5,000,000 years ago by Bibidi. He 
went out and slaughtered the North, West, and South Kaioshins, 
(Overgods) and absorbed the Dai Kaioshin, making him fat in appearance. 
The one remaining Kaioshin, East Kaioshin, killed Bibidi in a showdown, 
thus stopping Buu. However, Bibidi's son, Babidi, later freed Buu with 
the help of Dabura and Majin Vegeta, who were being controlled by 
Babibi.


Unique Attack List

- Spinning Tackle
How to perform: Hold Back (2 seconds), Forward, Y
Description: Buu pulls himself into a small ball, then rushes straight 
out quickly. Due to the fact that you must walk back, and you fly such 
a short distance, I find this one utterly useless.

- Super Cut
How to perform: Down, Forward, Y
Description: Buu sweeps his arms up and out, knocking the opponent into 
the air. Nice for getting the damn guy away from you.

- Shogekiha
How to perform: Back, Forward, A
Description: Buu shoots an extremely fast and invisible mind blast 
(although it can be seen in the smaller figure). Nice and quick, but 
takes up too much of your energy meter for such a small attack.

- Triple Blast (Kakusan Energy Dan)
How to perform: Down, Forward, A
Description: Just like the attack of Marai Trunks, he shoots three 
energy shots all at once, which are parallel to one another. It's 
pretty good, but not the most useful attack.

- Butt Stomp
How to perform: Back, Down, Forward, B
Description: Buu leaps into the air, then comes crashing down, hitting 
the opponent with his butt plenty of times. Does a good amount of 
damage if hit all the time. Plus, it's very funny to watch.

= Ki Bullet
How to perform: Back, Down, Forward, A
Description: Buu powers up, tells the opponent how much he hates them, 
and fires a ball of ki at them. Quite Good.

= Might Boomer
How to perform: Down, Back, Forward, A
Description: Buu powers up, and fires a ball of ki at them. I don't 
find it much different, plus Buu yells "Go to hell" or something like 
that.

# Buu Buster
How to perform: Back, Forward, Down, Up, Y
Description: Buu throws the opponent over his head, then juggles them 
over his head with punches. Then, he fires off a slow moving Ki Bullet 
to finish 'em off.

Little Bio: Dabura is lord of the underworld. He is possessed by Babidi 
to do his work. He has the ability to turn people into stone, and 
always follows his master's commands.


Unique Attack List

- Renzoku Energy Dan
How to perform: Down, Forward, A
Description: Just like everyone else's. Dabura lets three blasts out 
from his hand. Pretty good.

- Sekikatsuba
How to perform: Back, Forward, A
Description: Darbura spits out a very fast moving poison from his 
mouth. In the DBZ manga/anime, this attack turned targets into stone, 
but that doesn't happen in this game. {Insert cheers and groans here} 
Besides that, its speed renders it quite useful. 

- Upper Cutter
How to perform: Down, Forward, Y
Description: Darbura charges forward for a split second, then lets his 
upper cut do the damage. It's good just to knock someone flat and get 
away from them.

- Sword Blast
How to perform: [while in the air] Back, Down, A
Description: Dabura pulls out his sword and shoots a diagonal blast 
from it. It's good for catching your enemies off guard.

- Fiery Wall
How to perform: Down, Up + A
Description: Kind of Like Vegita's attack, except that he makes a wall 
of fire. Not very useful, since your opponent must be right in your 
face, and I always seem to have trouble pulling it off.

= Ball of Death
How to perform: Back, Down, Forward, A
Description: Dabura forms a ball of ki behind his back, the chucks it 
at his opponent. Not bad, really, but I wish it were a little more 
flashy.

= Fiery Breath
How to perform: Down, Back, Forward, A
Description: Dabura powers up, and shoots a fiery ki blast from his 
mouth straight for the enemy. Very nice indeed.

# Sword Rush
How to perform: Back, Forward, Down, Up, Y
Description: Dabura rushes and knocks the opponent just above his head, 
then uses both his fists and sword to keep hitting them in the air. 
After they land, he finishes them off with a small Fiery Breath attack. 
It's pretty easy to pull off and does a lot of damage.

Little Bio: After Buu slaughtered most of the Kaioshins, the East 
Kaioshin still remained. He is extremely powerful, and is by far the 
most powerful being in Heaven. He is very surprised that Goku and 
Vegita are stronger than him.


Unique Attack List

- Punch Rush
How to perform: Hold Back (2 seconds), Forward, Y
Description: Kaioshin unleashes a load of crazy punches at anyone 
stupid enough to walk that close. It's pretty good, perfect for your 
unsuspecting opponents.

- Stun Blast
How to perform: Hold Back (2 seconds), Forward, B
Description: Kaioshin shoots a very fast moving, invisible blast 
(although it can be seen on the top "radar" screen) that stuns the 
opponent for a moment. If only Kaioshin had a Super Meteo attack, then 
this attack would've been perfect to get time to perform it.

- Kienjin
How to perform: Forward, Back, Forward, Y
Description: Kaioshin swings his arms around in a circle. It cause a 
very good amount of damage for a normal attack, and good for those 
times when your enemy comes from another direction. It's very useful 
and easy to perform.

- Energy Zan
How to perform: Back, Down, A
Description: Just like Marai Trunk's attack. Kaioshin throws ki down at 
the ground and it runs along the ground toward the opponent. Good for 
those annoying duckers.

- Quad Kick
How to perform: Back, Down, Forward, B
Description: Kaioshin rushes and kicks the opponent four times in a 
row. Very good.

= Ki Thrust

Description: Kaioshin forms a large ball of ki on his finger, then lets 
it go in a tightly packed blast. Pretty good. Average.
