<ol><li>Android 17 was created to destroy Goku.  Both him and his twin sister (Android 18) are constructed using a human base, making them mechanical and biological.  After running for his life from Vegita and the Z-fighters, Dr. Gero returns to his lab where he tries to convince Android 17 and his sister to fight the Z-team.  The androids don't like being told what to do, so #17 kills his creator by kicking his head off and then crushing it.  Accompanied by Android 18 and Android 16, they go off seeking Goku.  Android 17 was a strong fighter, and could have beaten Super Saiyan Vegita even though Vegita killed Android 19 like nothing.  However,  Android 17 soon gives up on destroying Goku when he is forced to flee for his life from Cell.  He is eventually absorbed by Cell allowing Cell to turn into his 2nd Form.  He briefly makes another appearance in DBGT as Super Android 17.</li>

<B>The Ginyu Force </B>
<font size="-1" face="Times New Roman" color="white">
<p>
<br>
<li>The Ginyu Force is Freeza's special private army. Their leader, Captain Ginyu is big, purple,
and has two horns. He was specially chosen by King Cold himself (Freeza's Father) to lead the
Ginyu Force due to his unique "Body Changing" technique. He is a proud and confident warrior.. 
although like the other Ginyu members, he's kind of insane.</li>
<BR>
When formulating the team, Captain Ginyu chose Recoome first, due to his incredible ability to
take punishment and dish it out as well. Although Recoome's powerlevel is 33,000* a blow from 
him counts as the FULL 33,000! Recoome looks like DBZ's version of the Hulk, although he has 
yellow skin and orange hair.
<BR>
Ginyu also chose Burter for his super speed. Burter is an extremely tall, blue-skinned,
reptilian-like alien. He is prides himself on being the fastest warrior in the universe. Jeese and
Guldo made it on the Force by "trying out" for it. Jeese is shorter and has orangish-redish skin.
Although he is quite powerful, Jeese is not as confident in his abilities as some of the other 
Ginyu members are in theirs. Guldo is short, green, 4-eyed, and by far the weakest on the team.
Really the only reason he made the team is because of his awesome ability to freeze time. Time will
remain frozen as long as Guldo can hold his breath.
<BR>
The Ginyu Team are feared throughout the galaxy. They are summoned by Freeza to Planet Namek, to 
recover the Dragonballs and put an end to Vegita's insurrection on Namek. They are defeated by Goku 
however, and all are killed except for the Captain himself. The Captain is permanently turned into a 
frog, when he attempts to switch bodies with Vegita, and Goku throws a frog inbetween.

After Goku refused, Raditz took Gohan away and held him hostage until Piccolo and Goku came to battle him. Raditz is defeated by Piccolo and Goku, but Goku is destroyed along with him.</li>

<li>Taurus is a clone of Goku, who makes his appearence in DBZ Movie #3. He comes to Earth to plant the seed of an incredible tree. He uses this tree, called the Tree of Might, to bear rich fruit that gives great energy to anyone who eats it. The downside is that the tree will suck everything from the planet until it's a barren wasteland, making it uninhabitable. King Kai warns Goku about the tree, and he and the rest of the Z-Warriors go off to destory it. But they find that the task is not so easy, as the henchmen of Taurus seem to be handling them. Everyone goes down except for Goku, and Gohan who transformed into an ape. Goku and Taurus have a battle and until Goku charges up his spirit bomb Taurus seems to win the fight. After that Taurus never appears again in another movie. </li>
