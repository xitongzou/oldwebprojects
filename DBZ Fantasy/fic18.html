<HR>
<p><I>This DBZ story is a tribute of sorts to the late, great A. E. Van
Vogt, and was directly inspired by the short story "Black Destroyer"
(also known as part one of "Voyage of the Space Beagle"). There--I
have already dropped far too many clues and given away the show to
those of you who read classic science fiction.  For those of you who
don't, this is a story about an certain incident that happened to
Raditz in the days when he was one of the three surviving Saiyan
slaves of Frieza--and not a very nice person.
</I></p>
<HR>
<p>
"WARNING! CRITICAL MALFUNCTION! WARNING! CRITICAL MALFUNCTION!"
<p>
Of all the things that could wake Raditz out of a sound sleep, the alarm
klaxon in his pod was the least welcome. Only death would have been a
more annoying and abrupt interruption--and the emergency alarm was a
warning that the latter was on its way.
<p>
"WARNING--"
<p>
"Shut the hell up, I heard you," growled the long-haired Saiyan as he
willed his hybernation-heavy eyes to open. The alarm obediently
silenced itself, but the red "Critical System Malfunction" lights
continued to flash, reminding Raditz that silencing the messenger did
not improve the message.
<p>
"Report! What's--" Raditz started to say in a hoarse voice, but was
seized by a fit of coughing as his irritated throat seized up. The air
in the pod was flat and dry and heavy with the anti-hibernation mist
that had been sprayed into the air to wake the grumpy warrior.
<p>
"PRIMARY MALFUNCTION (CRITICAL): PRIMARY POWER SUPPLY FAILURE!"
responded the pod obediently; the same message scrolled across the
window, projected by the pod's HUD system.  It continued: "SECONDARY
MALFUNCTION (SERIOUS): PRIMARY DRIVE FAILURE!"
<p>
"Power supply?" Raditz stared at the buttons and displays. "That
doesn't sound good. What's going on?"
<p>
"POD 39457 SWITCHED TO SECONDARY POWER SUPPLY. PROJECTED ENDURANCE,
ALL SYSTEMS: 12 HOURS."
<p>
"Twelve hours!" Raditz straightened as much as he could in the
claustophobic little bubble and braced his hands against the
door. "How far out from base am I?"
<p>
"INSUFFICENT ENDURANCE."
<p>
"Stupid computer! How far from base #26 am I <i>if</i> you're using the
primary drive and had a full fuel tank?"
<p>
"FLIGHT TIME TO BASE #26 ON PRIMARY DRIVE WITH 100% PRIMARY ENERGY
STORAGE: ESTIMATED 240 HOURS."
<p>
"Crud! Why do we have only twelve hours when we're still ten days out?
That makes no sense! Where did our power go?"
<p>
"SECONDARY ENERGY STORAGE AT 2%. NO READING ON PRIMARY ENERGY
STORAGE. NO DIAGNOSTICS LOGGED PRIOR TO TOTAL MALFUNCTION."
<p>
"Oh, crud. How long to base #26 on the secondary drive?"
<p>
"INSUFFICENT ENDURANCE."
<p>
"Yeah, yeah, I know. Idiot machine! How long to base #26 on the
secondary drive with a full tank?"
<p>
"FLIGHT TIME TO BASE #26 ON SECONDARY DRIVE WITH 100% SECONDARY ENERGY
STORAGE: ESTIMATED 720 HOURS."
<p>
Raditz clenched one big fist and released it again. Taking out his
fury on the only thing between him and hard vacuum would be less than
useful. Damn it! After surviving the destruction of Vegetasei, he was
<i>not</i> going to die of a stupid malfunction in the depths of
space!
<p>
"All right," he growled between gritted teeth. "Locate the closest
base, planet, or station, I don't care who it belongs to, as long as I
can breathe the air!"
<p>
Lights blinked in meaningless patterns for what seemed a long time;
finally, the pod computer answered:
<p>
"CLOSEST LOCATION MEETING SPECIFIED CRITERIA IS BASE #29. NAVIGATION
BEACON IS NOT AVAILABLE."
<p>
"Huh? Well, can you get there anyway?"
<p>
"INSUFFICIENT ENDURANCE."
<p>
Something cold gathered in the pit of Raditz's stomach. No. No! He
wasn't going to die out here, alone in space, without an enemy to
fight. NO!
<p>
"How long to base #29 on the secondary with a full fuel tank?" Raditz
held his breath waiting for the pod computer to answer.
<p>
"FLIGHT TIME TO TO BASE #29 ON SECONDARY DRIVE WITH 100% SECONDARY
ENERGY STORAGE: ESTIMATED 14.3 HOURS."
<p>
"Fourteen hours!" Raditz sagged back in the pod's cushioned chair and
began to laugh hysterically. "Fourteen hours! Only fourteen hours!" He
sat up again. "THAT'S JUST TWO HOURS DIFFERENCE, YOU MORON MACHINE! I
can hold my breath almost that long!"
<p>
"AFFIRMATIVE."
<p>
"Turn off everything but the drive, navigation and whatever systems
you need to get there...." It took Raditz five more sets of questions,
answers and alternate orders to the pod's computer before it yielded a
solution that he could survive... barely.
<p>
"SOLUTION MEETING SPECIFIED CRITERIA: TURN OFF AIR REGENERATION AT
T+14.08 HOURS."
<p>
"Do it. Go to base #29." The soft breeze of regenerated air blew over
Raditz's face; he started and found himself floating free in the
pod. He pulled his long hair around himself and strapped into his
seat; it would eventually get quite cold in the tiny, dark pod.
<p>

<p>
With nothing to do but stare at the stars from his darkened pod for
fourteen hours, Raditz did the obvious: he fell asleep... and dreamed
of the beginning of this misbegotten mission, back on Base #26.
<p>
<p><I>
...Curbit, the sinewy, brown, bulbous-eyed alien who commanded Frieza
Base #26 threw a data chip at Raditz, who had to drop to one knee to
catch it.  Dyarmin, Curbit's aide, smirked as Raditz looked up from
his submissive pose.
</I></p>
<p><I>
"You have your mission, Raditz," Curbit scowled--or so Raditz
thought. It was hard to tell with the alien, whose face looked like
the furrowed bark of an old tree, and rarely changed. "Scout three
planets in Sector 29A, report back here for debriefing and re-supply."
Curbit leaned forward slightly. "Make your reports to me personally
after each survey."  He leaned back and waved a gnarled brown hand
dismissively.
</I></p>
<p><I>
Raditz rose to his feet and frowned slightly. "Report to you
personally?" the big, long-haired Saiyan asked. Beside Curbit, his
aide Dyarmin shifted uneasily. The pale blue man of Zarbon's race
seemed surprised at the implied exclusion. So was Raditz.
</I></p>
<p><I>
Curbit's shoulders hunched, a sign of irritation. "That's what I said,
Raditz! Even a monkey should be able to understand an order that
simple! Now, get out of here!"
</I></p>
<p><I>
Raditz saluted and left quickly, gritting his teeth at the necessity
of saluting a creature whose charred skull he should have been
grinding underfoot. After seven years of bowing before Frieza and his
deputies, Raditz only hated it and them all the more.  Report
personally to Curbit? What the hell was the old tree root up to?
</I></p>
<p><I>
Raditz read enough of the data chip to find the coordinates of his
first destination, then headed out to the launch tower to terrify some
techs into giving him a ready pod right now. He'd read the rest of the
briefing on the way; he wouldn't have anything better to do, and would
have to hibernate most of the trip anyway.
</I></p>
<p><I>
Dyarmin accosted him at the pod bay door. "Listen, and listen well,
monkey! As soon as you return, I want you to tell me what you found on
each planet--before reporting to the commander. I'll be at the landing
field to meet you--and when you report to the commmander, don't bother
to mention my involvement. Do you understand, monkey-boy?"
</I></p>
<p><I>
Raditz scowled at the slim green-haired man. "You want me to break the
commander's orders behind his back on your say-so? Why the hell should
I? You're not my prince, and I don't like you that much either."
</I></p>
<p><I>
CRUNCH! Raditz's skull rang as he bounced off the bulkhead; a
follow-up punch to his gut doubled the long-haired warrior over,
groaning in pain. Dyarmin was much weaker than Zarbon, but still far
stronger than Raditz.
</I></p>
<p><I>
Dyarmin grabbed Raditz's long hair and yanked his head up. "Because,
you stupid monkey, I'll kill you if you don't. Prince Vegeta may be
Lord Frieza's favorite, but <i>you</i> are just another monkey who should
have burned with the rest of your filthy kind." The pale blue man
slapped the open button and pushed Raditz into the pod.  "Remember,"
he hissed as the pod hatch began to close, "first report to me!"
</I></p>
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz woke with a start; by the Rings and the Moon, he hated that
blue freak! Someday, when he got his strength up more, he was going to
kill the arrogant little bastard. The thought of Dyarmin's eyes widening
in the fear of impending death, of his pretty face all misshapen and
bloody buoyed Raditz's spirits immensely.  Imagining the sound of
Dyarmin's last breath rattling in his throat, and the sight of his
broken body going limp as he expired made Raditz almost cheerful. He
grinned to himself; maybe he'd break a few of the bastard's ribs and
drive the broken ends into his lungs--watching Dyarmin's face as he
drowned in his own blood would be priceless. Raditz could just imagine
the pretty lips turning black, bloody foam covering those
same lips, the sound of hard, whooping breaths as Dyarmin desperately
struggled to get air into his blood-filled lungs--
<p>
The sight of the completely frosted-over porthole jolted Raditz out of
his pleasant imaginings. He shivered and crossed his arms; it was
cold, very cold in the capsule, and the air was sharp and dry in his
throat. Damn it, why did he wear no leg or arm coverings, anyway?
Sure, it was less constricting and handier to be bare-legged and
bare-armed in a fight, but leggings like he'd worn in his cadet days
would have been a lot more comfortable right now.
<p>
Screw Dyarmin anyway. Raditz had figured out what Curbit was up to
after scouting the first world on his list--it was a real treasure
house: high-gravity world with a heavy metal core. The natives were
tough and wary; they had taken out the last two of Frieza's scouts,
which was why Curbit sent a Saiyan. After discouraging the natives,
Raditz had found plenty of radioactives and valuable heavy metals. He
understood why Curbit wanted to keep this place under wraps: the
natives would make good soldiers, and the heavy metals and
radioactives made the planet undesirable for clearing and sale to
colonists, but could be mined and sold without involving the rest of
Frieza's organization.  Curbit would exploit the place himself and
make sure all the profits went into Curbit's pocket.
<p>
Dyarmin must have figured something was up, and wanted in on the
action--or else he planned on squealing to Frieza on the assumption he
would be promoted to the then-to-be empty commander's slot. Rings and
Moon! Greedy bastards and their stupid politics! They made Raditz's
head ache; he wanted nothing to do with it or them.  At least on
Vegetasei, he'd known where he stood and what was expected of
him--loyalty, honor, duty. Among Frieza's forces, there was no honor,
no loyalty except that inspired by terror of Frieza himself, and the
only duty was to grab what you could for yourself. Damn the bastards!
Raditz hated them all.
<p>
Raditz smirked to himself.  Yeah, he'd told Dyarmin about the first
planet right after getting out of the pod, and before walking into the
commander's office--but he didn't bother to tell Dyarmin that he'd
sent Curbit a private message via the pod's radio just before he
landed. He'd obeyed both of them to the letter.
<p>
His headache was getting worse--
<p>
"ESTIMATED 0.2 HOURS TO ARRIVAL AT BASE #29. UNABLE TO ESTABLISH
COMMUNICATIONS. REQUEST ORDERS?"
<p>
"What the--? What do you mean, you can't 'establish communications'?
You didn't tell me your Comm system was broken!" It was definitely
stuffy in the tiny pod.
<p>
"COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS ARE FULLY FUNCTIONAL. BASE #29 DOES NOT RESPOND
TO COMMUNICATION INITIALIZATION."
<p>
"So they're not talking to us? Crud." Something nagged at Raditz's
memory; what had the idiot computer said before? Oh, right. "And no
navigation beacon. Crud."
<p>
"AFFIRMATIVE."
<p>
Raditz grabbed a hank of his long hair and used it to wipe the frost
off the single porthole.  He was in orbit over an uninviting,
grey-brown world; its face was scarred by deep canyons and pocked by
craters on the high plateaus. The sharp edge of the horizon warned
Raditz that there was no air surrounding this barren rock of a world;
only Frieza Base #29 held any promise of warmth and life.
<p>
"Where's the base?" he growled.
<p>
A map grid suddenly overlaid Raditz's view of the world; as they
orbited, a blinking indicator pointed out the location of Frieza's
base.
<p>
"I can't see crap from up here. Go down there."
<p>
"NO NAVIGATION BEACON; OLD COORDINATES IN DATABASE MAY BE
INACCURATE. CONFIRMATION REQUIRED: DE-ORBIT AND INITIATE BASE LANDING
SEQUENCE WITH OLD COORDINATES?"
<p>
"Yes, you stupid machine! I told you to do it, so DO IT!" Raditz
panted; it was getting very stuffy, and his headache felt like someone
was pounding rocks into the side of his head. "I'll give you a better
target when I get close enough to see it."
<p>
"AFFIRMATIVE. DE-ORBIT INITIATED."
<p>
Five minutes later, the pod hurtled groundward on a ballistic
trajectory. The ride down was smooth and silent; without an
atmosphere, there was no atmospheric drag to slow and buffet the pod,
nor wrap its exterior in a blazing corona of ionized gases.  On the
other hand, without air braking... Raditz reflected that things could
get messy if the pod ran out of power before the final deceleration
phase.
<p>
It didn't run out until thirty seconds after landing.  To call the
pod's arrival at Base #29 a 'landing' was somewhat of a misnomer; the
tiny pod simply slammed into the landing pad after just enough
deceleration to keep the pod from smashing itself and its passenger
into pieces.
<p>
"Oh, crud." Raditz groaned; his head pounded horribly and there were
black spots at the edges of his vision. He waited a few seconds for
his head to settle down--it had been a harder landing than usual.
When the spots didn't fade away, but instead became more numerous,
Raditz cursed. It wasn't the landing--the air was bad and getting
worse!  If he sat here much longer, he would pass out and never wake
up.
<p>
He looked out over the small landing field; three more pads, all
empty. No one was running out to meet his pod; no lights illuminated
the field or showed in the base control tower.
<p>
"Crud! Is this place deserted?" Raditz panted like he'd been in a long
fight; he had to get inside <i>now</i>.  He raised his power slightly and
used his ki to pull the pod's air supply around him, compressed it,
held it against his skin, and then pulled the dead pod's emergency
hatch lever.
<p>
Bang! The small explosive charges blew the hatch open and Raditz
crawled out of the tiny spaceship into the hard vacuum of the dead
planet. At last! He looked around quickly; normally, he'd have several
minutes worth of air held close to his body for an excursion like
this, but not now--already the tainted pod air was making him
light-headed.
<p>
He trotted toward the nearest airlock; the outer lock was open, but
there was no power to the tell-tales. Raditz scowled to himself,
closed the outer lock manually, and threw open the pressure
valves.  As patiently as he could, he waited for the lock to pressurize.
<p>
It wasn't pressurizing.  Raditz's gaze fell on the inner lock, and the
coldness returned to the pit of his stomach.  There was a hole in the
inner lock, at knee-level. Not a large hole, but large enough; there
was no air in the base.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz could feel his strength waning as he wrenched the inner lock
open and closed it again. He blinked, trying to clear some of the
spots from his vision; the small ready-room swam and he had trouble
making out the details, but there were no lights on anywhere, no
illumination, no system tell-tales--only the harsh sunlight spilling
through the windows showed him the bodies on the floor.
<p>
Raditz stumbled and nearly fell over one of them as he staggered
toward the corridor. He had to find a compartment that could be
sealed, and restore power and air somehow all in the next few
minutes-- and he had no idea how! The coldness in the pit of his
stomach turned into real fear, now, and the teeth of panic started
nibbling at the edges of Raditz's mind.
<p>
He fell against the wall and braced himself as darkness swam before
his eyes. No! He couldn't die here, alone and forgotten! Raditz
blinked; in front of him was a small map of the base bolted to the
wall, showing the nearest emergency escapes and sealed
compartments. Not... good. The ready room sealed on both sides, but it
was already holed--no good.  A long tunnel connected the landing
field to the rest of the base; it should be sealed at the other end as
well, and there just might be air in the main control tower.
<p>
So close! Raditz tried to open the sealed hatch leading to the access
tunnel; his weakening grip slipped from the wheel as he
collapsed. Darkness swam between his eyes, and the long-haired warrior
could feel control of his ki slipping away---
<p>
The air rushed out of his lungs as his ki-field dropped; hard vacuum
stabbed his lungs like a breath of infinitely cold winter air inhaled
too deeply. It's not fair! I am a Saiyan warrior, I can't die like
this!
<p>
<p><I>...Raditz skidded across the practice ring on his back, painfully
scraping the bare skin. He flipped himself to his feet, only to meet a
kick across his already sore jaw--a kick that flung him to the ground,
this time to stay. It was all he could do to roll over to where he
could see his father.
</I></p>
<p><I>
"Don't you dare give up on me!" growled Bardock, staring down at his
battered son. "On your feet, brat!"
</I></p>
<p><I>
"Not fair!" young Raditz protested to his father. "You're stronger than I
am--I can't possibly beat you!"
</I></p>
<p><I>Bardock's booted foot came down hard on Raditz's chest, forcing an
involuntary gasp out of the boy. "Fair?" he said eyes blazing. "Fair?
Do you think the enemy will be 'fair' to you, brat? Do you think
they'll only send someone they know you can beat out to fight?"
</I></p>
<p><I>
"N-no," Raditz gasped; it was hard to breathe with the pressure on his
chest.
</I></p>
<p><I>"A Saiyan warrior never gives up, brat--he does whatever it takes
to win! You give up, you die.  You fight, even when the odds are
against you, you just might live to be a man, brat!" The pressure on
Raditz's chest increased. "NOW, FIGHT ME, BRAT!"
</I></p>
<p><I>Darkness swam before Raditz's eyes, obscuring his father's
fiercely scowling face. I'm going to die here if I don't get free, the
boy thought, panicking. He means to kill me! Raditz frantically
grabbed the booted foot and tried to push it away--no good, he wasn't
strong enough. He pounded ineffectually on Bardock's leg-- and felt
one of his own ribs crack under the relentless pressure.  In
desperation, Raditz pulled his left leg up, twisted, and straightened
his leg at the same time, slamming into the side of Bardock's knee
with his full strength.  Bardock went flying, and the dreadful
pressure was gone--Raditz could breathe again....
</I></p>
<p>
A Saiyan never gives up! This is a ready-room--and most of Frieza's
goons wouldn't know ki if it blew a hole through their stinking heads!
Raditz forced himself to crawl across the floor to the lockers lining
the outside wall. His vision was going fast--the vacuum sucked all the
moisture off his eyes and tiny blood vessels began to burst, and the
lack of oxygen was dragging him down into black oblvion--but he
slammed his fist through the thin metal door of the nearest locker and
wrenched it off its hinges. With his other hand he clawed feebly at
the contents as he fell, bringing it down on top of him. Blind, deaf
in the soundless vacuum, touch fading as his fingers went numb,
somehow Raditz found the mask and put it on his face; somehow, he
managed to turn the valve on the air tank....
<p>
Air, pure sweet air flowed back into his damaged lungs as he lay
there. His whole body tingled as life flowed back into it. Whatever
else happened, he would not die here in the cold and the
vacuum.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz cursed himself silently as coherent thought returned. Damn it!
He was an idiot! There were half a dozen better ways to have done
this--he could have left the capsule in orbit, while the air was still
good and flown down, he could have used the emergency medical oxygen
in the pod, he could have remembered the stupid spacesuit lockers
<i>before</i> he even left the pod--
<p>
If I don't stop acting first, thinking later, it's going to get me
killed, Raditz thought sourly. His vision was still blurry and
occluded by tiny blood clots, but he had air. Pain like dozens of
steel needles stabbed through his joints, and Raditz never knew how
close to death he'd come from air bubbles forming in the blood vessels
of his brain--but he had air! Raditz raised his ki again and
encapsulated himself in the remaining air from the air tank, and got
another one out of the locker. His thick Saiyan skin was tough enough
to stand up to vacuum, but his eyes and delicate nasal tissues
weren't. He moved slowly to keep from inducing a coughing fit that
would clog the respirator mask with blood from his damaged lungs.
<p>
Okay, he thought, now I have to find a sealable room, restore power,
restore life support <i>and</i> find a working regeneration tank and use
it! Can I make more work for myself, or is that it?
<p>
As he got to his feet and looked around, noting the vacuum-mummified
bodies on the floor, Raditz thought to himself, Yes--looks like I'll
be fixing the pod myself, too.  What the hell happened here?
<p>
The big, long-haired Saiyan picked up a light from one of the suit
lockers and shined it around the room. Scorch marks adorned the wall
in several places at knee-height, including the hole in the inner
lock. The corpses wore the armor of Frieza's soldiers; two of them had
blasters still in hand. Raditz picked up one of the guns and squinted
at it; it had been partially discharged. All three soldiers had had
their backs broken and their necks crushed.
<p>
So, thought Raditz, they were fighting something low to the ground and
quite strong--or they missed a lot. No sign of the attackers here. He
shrugged and cranked open the inner lock on the connecting tunnel,
then manually cranked it closed and opened the outer lock. The long
connecting tunnel was also airless. Raditz walked toward the main
control tower, checking the readings on his scouter as he moved. It
detected nothing living up ahead, but somewhere, something
lived. Whatever it was, it was elusive and weak; the scouter couldn't
get a consistant direction or range on it.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
The main control tower was as airless and lifeless as the landing
field ready room had been, but here there were no obvious punctures in
walls or locks. More bodies and parts of bodies littered every floor;
many of the soldiers had been shredded into bloody gobbets of muscle
and crushed bone. Where in all this mess were the power mains and the
life support controls?
<p>
It took Raditz a while to find them; he wandered about, reading every
label on every door and hatch, reading the little schematic maps on
corridor walls that he'd never before paid attention to for what
seemed like hours.  The blurriness in his eyes forced him to lean
close to the signs and maps, squinting painfully to read them.  Twice
he had to break off his search and return to the little ready-room for
more air tanks--worse yet, his stomach was growling.
<p>
Raditz pushed his hunger aside for the time being. He already knew
where the mess hall was, and couldn't eat until pressure was restored
in any case. Once that was done, he should have no trouble finding
food; even if the mess hall was cleaned out, there was plenty of
vacuum-dried meat lying around. It wouldn't be the first time he'd
survived on jerked soldier.
<p>
He found the life support controls first--and the corpse of the
technician who had removed the safety interlocks and pulled the
emergency decompression switch. That was what the large red warning
label said it was, anyway, and it was most definitely pulled
out. Raditz broke away the frozen fingers and shoved the switch back
into its socket and closed the safety latch over it; now what?
<p>
Idiot! Raditz mentally rebuked himself. Without power, nothing's going
to happen! Where are the damn power mains? He resumed his search. Two
floors up he noticed the base infirmary, but did not enter; it was of
no use to him without power. At the top of the control tower was the
main base control room--all in darkness. Raditz shined his light
around; yes, there was a console marked 'Power Systems' but it was as
dark as everything else. Raditz clenched a fist; he so wanted to just
blow apart half the tower! Damn this crap, he was not a stupid
weakling of a technician! It wasn't his job, he was a warrior, he
shouldn't have to figure it out!  It wasn't... fair.
<p>
Raditz growled then, behind the respirator mask. The universe didn't
care from 'fair'; he was here, he was alone, and he was stuck until he
fixed things himself, because no one else was going to come along and
do it for him.
<p>
So where the hell did these morons put the main power breakers? Raditz
scowled, looking around.  Think, idiot! Life Support was on the ground
floor; maybe the power mains are down there, too? Powerplant is on the
ground or underground, not up in a tower, so power cables got to come
into the building from below, right? Go back downstairs and look
again, idiot.
<p>
It didn't take Raditz long to find what he was looking for, once he
realized he should look behind the various "HAZARDOUS -- DO NOT ENTER"
and "DANGER -- HIGH VOLTAGE" placards. He stared at the main power
breaker; it was open. Raditz reached over and closed it.
<p>
Nothing happened. Raditz opened it again and shined the light around.
No, no other switches on this line--the main power plant must be down,
he thought.  Another breaker caught his eye--he bent down and squinted
at the placard beside it. "Emergency Power"; it was also open.  Raditz
raised an eyebrow; shouldn't that be closed, or on standby?  Crud! He
wasn't a technician, he didn't know! Still... Raditz closed the
breaker.
<p>
Lights flickered on all around him. Raditz smirked triumphantly, and
started to trot down the corridor to the Life Support panel--and
stopped just before he started coughing up his lungs. He fought the
urge down, knowing he'd lose control of his ki and breathe vacuum
again if he did.  Slowly, you moron, slowly! Raditz rebuked
himself. It would be really stupid to die at this point.
<p>
He kicked the dead technician out of the way and looked at the buttons
and switches and now-lit tell-tales, all labelled with cryptic terms.
Raditz scowled and clenched his fists again--Rings and Moon, he wanted
to blow the whole thing to hell! But he couldn't--not if he wanted to
live.  Raditz scowled blackly and promised himself that on his way off
this miserable base, he would stop long enough to vaporize the whole
damned place!
<p>
Now, all he could do was try all the little buttons and switches.
Raditz groaned; this could take a while--and his stomach was growling
again!
<p>
It took a long time; Raditz had to go back to the landing field for
another air tank before it was done.  He measured time by air tanks,
for that was the only thing that mattered--and by hunger. At last the
moment came when Raditz heard--yes, heard!--pressure doors slide open
and closed, and could feel air pressing around him again.  At last he
set down the air tank and mask he'd been wearing for so many hours and
leaned back, letting the ki field drop.
<p>
His breath gurgled through aching lungs, reminding Raditz of his next
task--turning the regeneration tanks back on. At least he knew how to
operate the things--he'd been in them enough times. He climbed wearily
back up the stairs to the main base control room and began the tedious
process of figuring out the controls.
<p>

<p>
Deep underground, the coeurl's head lifted up, its sensitive ear
tendrils quivering.  It sensed life, life in the dead base far above!
Massive shoulders flexed as it rose to its feet; it was a strong life,
rich in the <i>id</i> it hungered for. The coeurl padded through the long
access tunnel that connected Base #29's still-pressurized main power
generator with the rest of the base....
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
The door to the base infirmary was jammed shut; Raditz wrenched it
open with brute Saiyan strength.  Lights glimmered inside; he'd already
turned the power on from the control room, and the regeneration tanks
should be ready for use--
<p>
--They should have been. Raditz stopped short, the coldness gathering
in his guts again.  Every tank was smashed and half-melted; the walls
were scorched and burned. There had been a fight, an explosion,
something... the tanks were gone. There would be no healing here.
<p>
"CRAP!" He'd worked for so many hours just to get air and power, and
for yet more hours to get power and water and heat to here, so he
could be healed! It wasn't <i>fair</i>!
<p>
"DAMN THIS! Damn you for this mission, Curbit! Damn you, Frieza, for
existing, and DAMN WHOEVER WRECKED THIS PLACE!" Raditz snapped one arm
forward in a fit of pique, hurling energy at the half-melted remnants
of one of the tanks.  The ki blast struck and exploded, filling the
room and throwing Raditz back through the door.
<p>
Raditz drew in a deep breath--and promptly doubled over, coughing.  He
hacked up black gobs of clotted blood, and felt himself choking on the
blood pooling in his lungs. He coughed harder, forcing the suffocating
liquid out of his chest; fresh, bright blood streamed out of his mouth
and nose.
<p>
"Oh, that was brilliant, Raditz! Are you sure Bardock didn't just find
you under a rock somewhere? No one is going to mistake you for
Kinoko's kid, that's for sure!" The long-haired Saiyan mocked himself
in a whisper, drawing slow, careful breaths.  He held very still,
waiting for his wounded lungs to stop bleeding, afraid to knock the
clots loose again.
<p>
And what was this fairness crap? The universe wasn't fair; Raditz had
known that since the day he graduated from Guard training. He should
have been commissioned in the Royal Guard--it should have been a day
of celebration, of triumph, of pride; he should have knelt before the
king to receive his commission, with his sponsor Turles standing
behind him, and both his mother and father watching....
<p>
It should have been the way he'd always dreamed--but when the day
came, Kinoko was dead, killed in an ill-fated mission just a month
before, and Bardock seemed to resent that his long-haired son lived
when she did not. His own father somehow persuaded Turles to send
Raditz away from Vegetasei on the very day he should have been
commissioned, on a long independent scouting mission worthy of any
low-class common soldier. He'd been reassigned as if he had washed
out, never to be a Guardsman, forever just a common soldier through no
fault or act of his own.
<p>
Raditz never learned why or how he offended his father so much; in
another bitter twist of fate, the humiliating mission saved his
life. Raditz was very far away from Vegetasei when the world met its
fate; far enough away to be one of only three survivors. The universe
was far from fair--it was random and cruel and hated Saiyans.
<p>
Fine. He'd hate the universe back, and treat it like any other enemy:
never give in, don't give it a chance, and keep fighting no matter
what it threw at him.
<p>
Comforting thoughts--but hunger still gnawed at Raditz's stomach, and
exhaustion dragged at his limbs. Before he could even think about
fixing the pod, Raditz had to have food and sleep. Preferably in that
order.
<p>
What little real food he could find and thaw was vacuum-dry and
tasteless. Raditz was no cook, but he managed: in the galley, he
heated a cauldron of water and filled it with whatever meat was
handy--after picking out the shattered bits of armor and weapons. It
wasn't the tastiest stew he'd ever eaten, but it sated his hunger.
<p>
There's something not quite right about this, Raditz thought as he
ripped the meat from an arm bone. It should be saltier--especially the
Apulian here.  They're usually almost too salty to eat, and this one
has no taste at all. Weird. What could take the taste out of the meat
like that? Raditz shrugged, threw a double handful of salt into the
stew, and continued eating.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
BEEP! The warning tone on Raditz's scouter jerked him awake--
<p>
--something crashed into Raditz, a heavy blow to his skull that made
his ears ring.  Instinctively he reached out to grab and crush; he
felt fur and hard muscles bunch and twist against his bare arms. Sharp
claws raked his chest as Raditz's attacker evaded his grasp.  A
fur-covered, heavily muscled tentacle wrapped itself around Raditz's
neck and squeezed; claws stabbed into his left arm, slicing it to the
bone. Raditz disregarded the sudden pain and slammed his right fist
into the furry body that pinned him to the bunk; something cracked
under the blow.
<p>
A hideous yowl split the air; the tentacle whipped itself free of his
neck, and the writhing mass of fur and muscle pinning Raditz down
vanished. Raditz heard the soft thud-thud of four padded feet fleeing
down the corridor.
<p>
"What the hell--?" The urge to cough was strong; Raditz fought it down
again and found the compartment light.  The former cook's quarters
were empty of any life besides Raditz; whatever had attacked the big
Saiyan was gone. Raditz donned his scouter and tried to tune it.
<p>
"Crud." No matter how he adjusted the instrument, Raditz could pick up
nothing definite; range, power level, bearing all seemed to change
randomly. "An energy manipulator! It's distorting the readings
somehow. Strong, too; anyone else would have been dead with a busted
skull and broken neck." Raditz held his bleeding arm and slowly
wrapped a bandage around it. "Hell of a wake-up."
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
It took Raditz longer than he expected to roll his tiny pod into a
maintenance hangar. It wasn't the distance, or the vacuum--he had
planned for that--it was the sheer work.  Every time he started
breathing hard, he had to stop before he started to cough and tore
loose the clots that keep him from drowning in his own blood. The same
clots that kept his blood in his arteries and out of his lungs also
made Raditz's breathing harder; it didn't take much labor to leave him
panting, out-of-breath and ready to start coughing his lungs out
again. The spasms in his left arm and the pain in his joints didn't
help.
<p>
Three times his scouter beeped a warning at him; the maddeningly
elusive power had skittered into close range with a high enough power
to register an alarm. Each time Raditz stopped his pushing and pulling
and looked around, though he could see nothing but blurs beyond a
dozen meters. None of the blurs moved that Raditz could see, and
nothing attacked, but the short hairs on the back of Raditz's neck
prickled. His tail tip twitched uneasily from side to side; something
was watching him.
<p>
"Come and get me," Raditz growled to whatever might be listening. "I'm
hungry for some fresh meat!"
<p>
Nothing answered.
<p>
"Heh. Guess it's more goon stew for lunch, then," Raditz remarked. The
pod was in the hangar--now all he had to do was find the manuals that
would tell him how to fix it and the tools to fix it with. Simple;
nothing to it.
<p>
Not all the meat was tasteless, Raditz noticed. There was still taste
in the intact carcasses; only the shredded, broken-boned ones were
oddly lacking in flavor. None of the meat had been eaten in any
case--which made no sense to Raditz. Why tear up the corpses <i>after</i>
killing them if nothing was needed from them? Ritual mutilation? An
atrocity to demoralize the survivors? Raditz's tail tip twitched
nervously; something didn't seem quite right about it either way.
<p>
Something strange had happened here--and that strangeness had already
presumed to attack him.  As he gnawed the meat off of a boiled
thighbone, Raditz decided to keep his eyes open for more than just the
right tech manuals.  It might be important.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
It took Raditz less time than he'd feared to find the tech manuals and
tools he needed.  The maintenance hangar office was well-organized;
Raditz had only to look up the right model number for his pod. The
tool cabinets and parts bins were equally well-organized and
well-stocked.
<p>
This shouldn't take too long, thought Raditz. In the worst case, I
just replace everything and it should work. Hmmm...
<p>
Raditz blinked in disbelief after he lifted off the access panel on
the tiny pod's drive.  The inside was blackened and scorched; the
damage centered on the primary power supply which was now no more than
an burned-out shell.  "What the hell?? It looks like it blew up!"
That's impossible, he thought; those things just don't explode!
<p>
They do if someone shorts the terminals together, a nasty dark
suspicion told Raditz. The coldness crept back into his gut. Raditz
removed the destroyed power supply and plugged the shore power cable
into the tiny pod. As soon as it powered up, and the flashing
tell-tales showed that the tiny spaceship's computer was again
operating, Raditz started running diagnotics--his way.
<p>
"Listen, computer! What was your secondary energy storage level at the
moment of malfunction?"
<p>
"SECONDARY ENERGY STORAGE LEVEL WAS 2%," answered the computer.
<p>
"At what time during the mission did your secondary power drop below,
uh, 10%?"
<p>
"SECONDARY ENERGY STORAGE LEVEL WAS 2%," answered the computer.
<p>
"Huh? Repeat that--no, I heard you." The coldness gathered into a hard
knot in Raditz's stomach. It never <i>dropped</i> to 2%? But that means...
"Computer, what was secondary energy at when we departed Base #26?"
<p>
"SECONDARY ENERGY STORAGE LEVEL WAS 2%," answered the computer.
<p>
"Oh, crud." So I was sent out with a drained backup power supply and
with the main power supply rigged to blow in mid-flight! Someone
wanted me dead--but didn't want to face me, or be caught doing
it. Why? Who?
<p>
Dyarmin or Curbit--one of those two. I know about their treasure
world, and I might talk about it. Raditz stood abruptly and began to
pace. But if Dyarmin was going to turn Curbit in to Frieza... No, he
might have decided he wanted the pie for himself; if Curbit met with
an 'accident', Dyarmin would be in charge without having to reveal
Curbit's shennanigins with the treasure world. Or Curbit may have
realized his danger, and gotten rid of both me and Dyarmin. Ah, crud!
I hate this kind of crap!
<p>
Well, I'll know who tried to kill me when I get back--he'll be the
survivor, if I've got it figured right. Damn it! I'm not strong enough
to kill either of those slimy bastards--and I'll be toast as soon as
the bastard responsible finds out he didn't get me the first
time. Raditz paced back and forth, his tail lashing angrily behind
him.
<p>
Unless... he pondered, unless I don't stay long enough for them to set
me up again. If Vegeta or Nappa were to send for me on Frieza's
business, whoever's left at Base #26 wouldn't dare interfere.... Yes!
Raditz smacked one fist into the other.
<p>
"Time to make a call," he said aloud as he tuned his scouter to
Nappa's private frequency.  Raditz tapped the scouter once to open the
channel--
<p>
--nothing.  The long-haired Saiyan tapped his scouter again and stared
in disbelief at the readout on his eyepiece.  "'No relay available?'
What is this crap?"
<p>
Raditz stalked over to the maintenance office and searched through the
neatly labelled racks until he found a scouter operation manual. It
took him only a few minutes of study to find the bit of information he
was looking for.
<p>
"Uh-huh. So my scouter doesn't have enough power by itself to reach
another scouter at interstellar distances--I never knew that!--and it
can't find a live pod or spaceship communicator or base station to
relay the signal. Huh." Raditz pulled the tiny silver disk out of his
scouter's reader and started to toss it back in the drawer he'd gotten
it from--and reconsidered. "Might need it again," he muttered.
<p>
"Hmmm... I know why my pod's communicator isn't working, but what's
wrong with the base's communicator?" Raditz wondered as he started
yanking out scorched and blasted parts from his pod. Quickly yet
methodically he repaired the tiny pod, referring constantly to the
manuals he'd liberated from the maintenance office.  Once the pod's
energy storage cells were replaced and circuits tested, he set the new
cells up to charge, stepped back and stretched. Raditz's joints
cracked and popped, his back ached, his chest still hurt, and his head
throbbed from the effort of squinting at the readouts on his scouter
for hours on end, but by the Rings and Moon!--his pod was FIXED!  Now
all he had to do was wait until it was fully charged.
<p>
Raditz's stomach growled.  Okay, that wasn't all he had to do. He had
to eat, too. And while he was at it, he might as well find out why the
base communicator was offline.  And given the tiny trickle of power he
was getting out of the base's emergency backup generator, he'd have
another night's sleep before he could possibly be ready to
leave. Maybe the furry thing with the tentacles would attack him
again; Raditz was really hungry for fresh meat.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Tasteless, boiled vacuum-dried meat was getting really old, Raditz
decided as he chewed and chewed on a strip of meat that hadn't been
boiled quite long enough. It was marginally better than starving, but
the sooner he got out of here to someplace with Real Food, the
better. Where was that furry thing?
<p>
Nothing leaped out from under the tables to pounce on him, so Raditz
resumed studying the Base Communications Manual. The base's big
communicator and sensors were all controlled from the main control
room, and Raditz thought he could figure out how to use them.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Two hours later, Raditz knew the truth: the base communicator did not
work because something had cut the cable to the main antenna. The
base's main powerplant might still be working, but something had cut
the cable between the powerplant and the main control tower. The base
crew had not evacuated because something had destroyed all their
pods....
<p>
Raditz had stumbled on the watch officer's logs while trying to get
the base computer to tell him just <i>why</i> it couldn't activate
communications. The last entry was only seven days old; whatever had
killed the base so thoroughly had done so only a few days before
Raditz's arrival.
<p>
As he read through the logs, Raditz determined two things: the
attacker was incredibly stealthy and apparently immune to blaster
fire.  "Or hard to hit," muttered Raditz; he had a very low opinion of
the competence of the general run of Frieza's soldiers. Whatever it
was, the thing that killed everyone else on base was also cunning; it
had systematically cut off communications and escape, then weakened
and demoralized the soldiers by destroying the infirmary and cutting
power before moving in for the kill.  In desperation, the base
commander had ordered the emergency decompression of the base, in the
hope of suffocating the thing that was killing them in the dark.
<p>
The order was the last entry in the log.
<p>
"That didn't work so well, did it?" Raditz commented sardonically; he
was sure that the midnight predator in fur and tentacles was the thing
that had massacred the base. He turned back to earlier log
entries. The first hint of the thing had been nine days ago, when a
perimeter guard vanished while patrolling the edge of Upper Chlorine
Canyon. Upper Chlorine Canyon? Raditz stabbed at a console button and
brought up a map on the display.
<p>
Ah. Those deep canyons he'd seen from orbit were deep enough to hold
atmosphere--a nasty, poisonous mix of chlorine and nitrogen. The upper
reaches of one such canyon ran only a few miles from the base. Had
something come up out of the canyon to attack the base? If so, why?
This base had been here for years; why attack it now?
<p>
Raditz went back and forth, trying to find a clue in the log
entries. After the first guard vanished, small work parties on the
east side of the base--the side nearest the canyon, Raditz
noted--started turning up dead, torn to bloody shreds... and according
to the doctor's report, something had stripped the potassium ions from
their nerves, their muscles, their blood and their very bones.
<p>
Raditz's lips curled back in a snarl; he flexed his wounded, aching
arm.  "Now I know why the meat is so tasteless around here; half the
salt's gone." Raditz growled, and surfed through the remaining logs.
<p>
He found it. One entry leaped out at him in all its awful significance:
<p>
<p><I>Standard Date 2303.10.57: Party of four given leave to requisition
sealed crawler for exploration of Lower Canyon ruins. Departed 0800
hours.
</I></p>
<p>
Ruins? Raditz smiled coldly; he knew the mindset of Frieza's
goons. They would have been bored mindless on an empty planet like
this: no combat, no combat pay, no loot. Probably the base commander
had allowed them to go treasure-hunting in the ruins of whatever
extinct race once lived on this rock just to keep them from shooting
each other out of sheer boredom and frustration.  Treasure-hunting and
using the local chlorine-breathing lifeforms for target practice would
keep them busy and out of trouble.
<p>
Too bad they attracted the attention of something much more dangerous
than they were. Likewise, someday Dyarmin was going to regret he'd
ever attracted Raditz's attention....
<p>
PIP! Raditz's scouter alerted him to a nearby power. It was the same
power from before, the one that changed and couldn't be pinned
down. Damn! The creature was in the main tower with him, somewhere.
<p>
"Crap!" Raditz walked quickly for the elevator, trying not to cough,
forcing himself not to run; his pod was unprotected!  The damn thing
had destroyed all their pods; Raditz had worked too hard on his to
lose it now.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Too late; he was too late. Raditz could see that as he opened the
maintenance hangar lock. The pod he'd worked so hard on was scattered
in pieces across the hangar floor.
<p>
"DAMN YOU LOUSY, STINKING, <i>TAIL-GRABBING</i> BASTARD!" The floor shook
as Raditz's power rose explosively; tools vibrated off benches and
fell to the floor, only to be followed by heavier cabinets and
shelves.  Hundreds of long-lost nuts and washers rose from crevices
and corners to hover in the air--
<p>
--and clinked to the floor as Raditz drew in his gathered power. His
scouter pipped gently; his enemy had already fled. "Cowardly beast!
Yeah, come and get me--I'll teach you what it means to hunt a Saiyan!"
<p>
Raditz cursed as he looked at the ruined pod, a long, drawn-out growl
of malediction in the dead Saiyan language. It was not so much damaged
as disassembled; the creature hadn't had time to do more than smash
one or two large components.  There would be spares somewhere in the
maintenance hangar--but it would be hours of tedious work to
re-assemble the thing. Hand work, manual labor with machines, when
there was an enemy to hunt and kill!
<p>
If he left the maintenance hangar to hunt the beast, it would give the
thing a chance to destroy his pod completely. The hangar had a lot of
spare parts, but there were no complete hulls; if his was destroyed,
that was it. Raditz growled more curses; he would have to stay with
the pod until he launched in it. He couldn't hunt the beast, he
couldn't even leave for food! At least there was water in the hangar.
<p>
Reluctantly, Raditz began to work on the pod. Doing the same
incredibly tedious job over again, knowing all his effort the first
time had been for nothing, was the hardest work he knew of. His arms
and legs dragged. Raditz felt like he was burdened with two or three
times his normal weight, though the only burden was in his weary
heart.
<p>
Many hours later Raditz slumped in the seat of his almost-repaired
pod. Only one thing more remained--hooking up the primary and
secondary energy storage--but he couldn't do it. Not yet; he was too
tired, too hungry, too injured.  His half-blind eyes couldn't hold
focus anymore; everytime Raditz tried to squint at the diagrams and
parts, everything he saw would split into two images and drift
apart. His chest hurt every time he breathed, and he shivered with
exhaustion.
<p>
Raditz dropped the tools at his feet. He'd lie back in the comfortable
seat and rest for just a few minutes--or hours--or forever. Just so
long as he got some sleep...
<p>
PIIP! The scouter's alarm jerked Raditz out of his sound
sleep. Something--the creature--was very close!  He still couldn't get
an exact fix on it; its power level fluctuated too much.
<p>
Raditz kicked out with his right foot, slamming open the half-closed
pod door and rolled out as it sprang open. A black blur lept over the
pod from behind him and crashed into Raditz--
<p>
Teeth and claws scraped across Raditz's armor but got no purchase; he
brought his knee up abruptly, catching the coeurl in its ribs. Two
black tentacles as thick as hawsers snaked around Raditz's body; he
quickly grabbed them just below where the ends split into limber
fingers, one in each big hand. The tentacles writhed and twisted
vainly in Raditz's grasp; the big Saiyan grinned wickedly as the
coeurl raked just as futilely at his ki-reinforced armor. A fell light
glittered in the cat-like creature's eyes as it snarled in Raditz's
face and lunged for his throat.
<p>
Even as it did so, Raditz ducked his chin and butted the coeurl full
in its face. It yowled like some huge cat and slammed Raditz's neck
with the broad of one powerful forepaw--powerful Saiyan muscles
shrugged off the shattering blow. Raditz rolled, still holding the
powerful tentacles away from his body, and brought his knees down on the
coeurl as he twisted it beneath him. It yowled again, and thrashed
wildly under him, trying to escape--
<p>
--Raditz twisted and yanked at the tentacle tips caught in his hands,
flinging the coeurl away from him; one slipped out of his grasp as the
coeurl hurtled through the air. As the coeurl's full mass hit the
tentacle still gripped in Raditz's right hand, the big Saiyan twisted
and snapped it viciously.
<p>
The coeurl howled as it landed halfway across the hangar; the bloody
tip of one tentacle remained in Raditz's hand.  The long-haired Saiyan
smirked as he tossed away the maimed cluster of tentacle-fingers.
<p>
"Not what you were expecting? Just wait a moment--I've got even more
surprises for you!"
<p>
Ki surged through him in the old familiar way; Raditz seized hold of
the power and hurled at the black blur crouched on the hangar floor.
<p>
KZAACK--phiissh? His blast vanished! Right when it should have hit the
creature, his ki blast just vanished into nothingness! He hadn't
missed; if he had, the blast would have blown something else up.  What
the hell--?
<p>
"AAARRRRGGGH!!" Raditz's whole body convulsed painfully as a massive
electrical shock coursed through the metal floor and up into his
legs. He fell, only to convulse again as the charge surged through
him.  The coeurl bounded across the floor toward Raditz, the
electrical shock fading away in the instant of its movement.
<p>
Racking coughs tore through Raditz; the painful, electrically-induced
convulsions had dislodged the clotted grue in his lungs. He braced
himself on his hands and knees, coughing up black clots of blood--and
the coeurl jumped on Raditz again.
<p>
Raditz was knocked sprawling to skid across the floor until abruptly
halted by hitting a hard metal parts bin. Bright red blood frothed
from his mouth and nose as Raditz's lungs bled again. The coeurl,
seething with strange energies, tore into Raditz; this time, it dug
into armor that heated, grew brittle, and shattered under the beast's
claws.
<p>
Raditz rolled, turning his exposed belly to the floor; the coeurl
wrapped one hawser-thick tentacle around the Saiyan's neck and
squeezed. Claws raked and tore the armor off Raditz's thighs--and a
flailing, taloned foot slashed across Raditz's tail.
<p>
Raditz couldn't scream past the tentacle choking him; he could only
pull weakly at the thing with the last of his strength. Powerful claws
pulled at Raditz's hair, trying to find exposed flesh to slash and
tear, but were defeated by the immense mass of stiff, spiky hair. He
whipped his own tail out from under the angry coeurl and snagged one
of the coeurl's legs with the supple limb.
<p>
He yanked the leg out straight and held it there. The coeurl twisted,
trying to pull itself free from the grip on its rear ankle, trying to
claw the base of Raditz's tail. The black spots were back in front of
his eyes as Raditz forced his battered body to its knees, one hand
holding the choking tentacle from tightening further, ignoring the
painful slashes across his back and buttocks. The creature's own belly
was pressed against the base of Raditz's tail, keeping it from doing
any significant damage to that tail.
<p>
Pain stabbed Raditz in the back of the neck as the coeurl sank its
sharp teeth into Raditz's neck and shoulder--only the thick, corded
muscles and the thicker mass of hair there saved Raditz from having
his head torn off. Sharp claws slashed the long-haired Saiyan's
back--but the long, long hair padded the blows; the great paws slipped
off the mass of hair, for the moment unable to reach through the hair
to sink deep into Raditz's back. Raditz got one knee under him and
half-rose; his head pounded ominously, and blackness swam in front of
his eyes.
<p>
Raditz suddenly heaved himself up, and threw himself onto his back,
coming down on the coeurl with all his weight. Several
hundred pounds of Saiyan muscle and bone slammed the coeurl into the
metal floor; bones cracked. The coeurl's grip loosened from the sudden
shock--ki flared in Raditz's hand and the coeurl howled as Raditz
ripped the cleanly-severed tentacle away from his neck.
<p>
The coeurl writhed out from under the big Saiyan and bolted; Raditz
rolled aside and coughed red froth out of his lungs. The coeurl ran,
fleeing blindly as Raditz held himself very still, arms wrapped around
his chest, until the bleeding stopped. After a while, Raditz realized
he was still breathing, if barely--one lung was drowned in blood, and
the other was very close.
<p>
"A Saiyan never gives up," Raditz whispered, not daring to force more
than a whisper's worth of air through his lungs.
<p>
<p><I>...Bardock righted himself and landed lightly on his feet a few
yards away. Raditz dragged himself to his feet, panting heavily. The
long-haired boy crouched, on guard and ready for the next move,
glaring angrily at his father all the while.
</I></p>
<p><I>Suddenly Bardock grinned. "What happened to 'I can't possibly beat
you?' Have you learned yet? Do you know why a Saiyan never gives up?"
</I></p>
<p>
<p><I>"Huh?" The battered young Saiyan blinked at his father. "Because
it's cowardly? Because the enemy will just kill you anyway?"
</I></p>
<p>
<p><I>Bardock snorted in disgust. "Sometimes I think all that hair
overheats your brain. Do you kill everyone you get in a fight with? I
hadn't noticed that many bodies lying around. Think before you answer:
if you're not a coward, and you're going to give up, when do you give
up?"
</I></p>
<p>
<p><I>Raditz opened his mouth to answer, and then thought better of
it. He frowned, thinking. "If I'm not a coward, I wouldn't give up
until I knew I couldn't win the fight," the young warrior said slowly.
</I></p>
<p>
<p><I>Bardock folded his arms. "But if you wait too long to be sure, you
might be dead first."
</I></p>
<p>
<p><I>"Yeah..." Raditz pondered, "but I'd give up as soon as I knew the
enemy was tougher than me, then."
</I></p>
<p>
<p><I>Bardock smirked. "You're always tougher than you think--ALWAYS!
Now do you know why a Saiyan never gives up?"
</I></p>
<p>
<p><I>Raditz stared at his father, shocked by sudden
understanding. "Be-because if you give up, you'll lose when you might
have won! You'll only be as strong as you think you are, and you'll
never find out how strong you really are if you always give up when
you think you've had it!"
</I></p>
<p>
<p><I>Bardock's only answer was a slow smile. "Come on, Raditz. Let's
see if Kin's got something left for us to eat..."
</I></p>
<p>
"I didn't give up. I even..." Raditz sighed and dragged himself over
to the pod, the coeurl's tentacle still gripped in one hand. "...got
some fresh meat out of it."
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz licked the last of the salty, tangy blood off his hands and
wiped the few remaining scraps of black, leathery hide off his lap
before standing. The wounded creature had not returned; perhaps it
would never return. Raditz had injured it badly.
<p>
No; that was a fool's dream. <i>Something</i> had driven or lured the
creature into attacking and massacring the entire base; something had
led it to attack Raditz repeatedly. Either it was starving, or Raditz
and the others somehow threatened it...
<p>
It would be back--and he would be lucky survive another ambush like
the last one.  No; he was a Saiyan, and a Saiyan did not wait around
to be killed. Only one thing to do now.... Raditz padded across the
metal floor; the trail of blood was easy to follow. Through airlocks
and down corridors, into ducts and through holes ripped through
armorplast walls Raditz followed the trail. When the visible
bloodstains petered out, he followed the rich, tangy smell of the
creature's blood and fear in the air and on the walls....
<p>
His hearing was getting better; Raditz could hear the soft "thip-thip"
of his booted feet padding along the deck. He hadn't kept track of the
time, but it must have been two or three days since his disasterous
landing--time enough and meals enough for damaged eardrums to heal.
<p>
The creature's trail led him down the long access tunnel to the main
power plant. He paused at the main access hatch, listening. Silence;
only the incessant whispering of the fans reached his ears. Raditz
turned on his scouter. It pipped and beeped, showing the elusive,
here-and-there energies of the creature. Yes; it was down here
somewhere. Raditz smiled coldly and opened the hatch.
<p>
The outer shell of the reactor dominated the hemispherical room; from
the white dome, coolant pipes radiated in all directions like the legs
of a gigantic pale spider. Somewhere below Raditz's feet generators
murmured, a steady vibration that set Raditz's teeth on edge. His
scouter continued to beep randomly; Raditz turned it off.
<p>
His nostrils flared; somewhere in this jungle of pipes and conduits
lurked his attacker. Raditz could smell its fear--and something
more. He raised his head and sniffed the air, a wild beast scenting
the wind. Yes! That tantalizing scent wafted from somewhere above...
<p>
Raditz climbed quickly up the access ladder to the control housing at
the top of the dome. He grimaced at the necessity; if it weren't for
his wounded lungs--
<p>
The scent was stronger up here. What, and where?  Ah! Guided by the
scent, Raditz noted the torn-out access panel. Inside the mechanism,
then. He crouched, ready to smash and break, grab and tear and crush
whatever lurked inside, and stepped through the hole.
<p>
Nothing attacked him. The light was dimmer, much dimmer inside, but
the Saiyan's eyes rapidly adjusted. He squinted, trying to make out
the details of the black mass tucked in amid control rods and gears.
<p>
"Well, well--now I know why the beast is so hungry," Raditz
smirked--and whirled as the coeurl attacked!
<p>
The big Saiyan dodged the coeurl's leap even as his fist slammed
solidly into the cat-thing's jaw, shattering it with a sound like
breaking bricks. The coeurl crashed helplessly into an electrical
panel, smashing it open; sparks flew momentarily, then vanished; thin
tendrils lining the cat-thing's ears fluttered and waved--
<p>
Raditz tackled the coeurl, locking one powerful arm around its head
and neck as he hammered the creature's ribs with his other fist. The
coeurl clawed at Raditz, but to no avail as the big Saiyan forced the
coeurl's head down to the floor; his right knee and body pinned the
creature's body against the wall, it could not break free of his
deadly grip.  The end came swiftly--Raditz clamped his free hand
around the coeurl's muzzle, shifted the arm that was locked around the
beast's neck, braced himself, and twisted.
<p>
KRAK! The coeurl shuddered; a wave of power seemed to pulse out of the
creature, shaking the deck and causing Raditz's hair to stand up--and
it fell limp. The coeurl was dead.
<p>

<p>
It didn't take very long to re-charge his pod's energy storage once
Raditz reconnected main power to the rest of the base. Diagnostics
checked out; his pod was ready to launch.  Only two more things to
do...
<p>
Raditz tapped his scouter on and tuned it to Nappa's private
frequency. This time, there was a live pod to relay the signal, and he
got through.
<p>
"...so I'll meet you there and give you a full report after I get out
of the tank at Base 26.  I think Prince Vegeta might find it
interesting, too. Over."
<p>
Nappa's voice crackled in Raditz's ear, full of the usual intimidation
and dark threats about Raditz's fate if he was wasting the Prince's
time.  Raditz smirked; he wasn't worried. Prince Vegeta would be
interested in the malfeasance and <i>weakness</i> displayed by some of
Frieza's key commanders; he would be more than interested in learning
how a cunning animal had single-handedly annihilated one of the
dreaded Frieza's bases... and there was the treasure world, too.
<p>
That took care of one thing. Raditz glanced down at the extra
packages for Base #26; pack those up, and he was ready to go.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Dyarmin was waiting for Raditz as the medical techs helped him out of
the pod. "Give me your report now, Raditz--I won't have time to get it
from you once you're out of the tank. You have orders to report to
Lord Frieza as soon as you're healed." The blue man's nose wrinkled in
distaste. "Vegeta himself relayed the orders to me," he said, wiping
his hands against his thigh armor as if there was something nasty
stuck to them.
<p>
Raditz's eyes narrowed above the oxygen mask that one of the medical
techs was holding to his face. So, Dyarmin was the survivor. "S'posed
to report to Curbit," Raditz whispered, slurring his words as if
barely conscious.
<p>
Dyarmin gave him a nasty smile and brushed a strand of dark green hair
away from his face. "Curbit died while you were away. There was a
recycling system malfunction and his nutrient bath got contaminated
with some of the chemicals--you know how nasty those catalysts can be
to living tissue--tch, I guess an ignorant monkey like you wouldn't
know, would you?  If it's not fighting, you Saiyans can't understand
it anyway."  He smirked and examined his aquamarine
fingernails. "Well?"
<p>
"Pod broke down on the way back; lost air.... found some strange stuff
on t'other planet," Raditz slurred, his eyelids drooping. "Brought
back...."
<p>
"Brought back what?" Dyarmin shouted as he pushed a medical technician
aside and bent down close to Raditz's face.  "What did you bring
back?"
<p>
"...brought back..." Raditz's whole body slumped; the other technician
rushed back to help his partner lower the collapsing Saiyan onto a
gurney.
<p>
"DAMN YOU!" Dyarmin grabbed Raditz by his chest armor and shook
him. "Don't you dare pass out on me!"
<p>
Raditz's eyes flicked open again and stared puzzedly at
Dyarmin. "...brought back sample for th' boss... in pod..." One hand
flopped down and fluttered in the direction of the grounded pod.
"Careful... they're special." His eyes fell shut and his body relaxed
completely.
<p>
Dyarmin released his grip and wiped his hand off on his armor. He
turned to glare at the technicians. "Well?"
<p>
One of them shook his head. "He's out completely. You won't be able to
talk to him until he's out of the tank--<i>if</i> he makes it."
<p>
Dyarmin snorted. "Take him away, then. I know what I need to, for
now."  He turned to the maintenance technicians, never noticing the
glint from underneath Raditz's long eyelashes. "You, there--clear the
landing area and bring this pod in to the hangar <i>now</i>!"
<p>
A little while later Dyarmin contemplated the two oddly sealed boxes
he'd found in the pod, wedged in on either side of the seat. What had
Raditz found on the second planet?  Perhaps it was a good thing the
long-haired monkey had made it back--having to explain to Frieza that
he, Dyarmin had lost the monkey just when Frieza had sent for it might
have been... difficult. But what had he found? There wasn't supposed
to be anything worth mentioning on that planet, but <i>something</i> had
caught the Saiyan's interest.... Trembling with suppressed excitement,
Dyarmin started to open the first box.
<p>

<p>
A few hours later, Raditz shook the last of the regeneration fluid out
of his long hair, stretched, and took a deep breath.  Rings and Moon,
it felt good to be able to do that without coughing his lungs up and
choking to death!
<p>
The two medics eyed him warily. "Master Raditz, how are you feeling?
The damage should be completely healed," asked the older of the two.
<p>
"Yeah, I'm fine," Raditz said, yawning lazily as he stretched some more.
<p>
The younger, or perhaps just smaller, of the two humanoids presented a
set of armor. "Your new armor, sir. Ummm..."
<p>
"Yeah?" Raditz asked as he pulled the torso armor over his head. Of
all Frieza's goons and flunkies, the medics were the only ones Raditz
tolerated.
<p>
"They said you had a malfunction in your spaceship--and the medical
computer <i>does</i> report decompression damage--but what could tear up
your armor and cut up a Saiyan warrior like that?"  The younger
medic's eyes were wide with awe.
<p>
Raditz smirked as he pulled on the rest of his armor.  "Oh, you'll
find out all about it in a few days."
<p>
The older technician looked quizzically at Raditz. "You mean when your
full report gets filed?"
<p>
"Something like that," Raditz said jauntily as he picked up his
scouter and headed for the door.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
"See my orders? Good. Now, why don't I see a pod?" Raditz growled at
the launch control officer.
<p>
The purplish amphibian blinked at him nervously. "Uh, we didn't get
any orders yet--must be an oversight. I'll take care of it right now!
Take Number 3; it's ready to go."  The slightly moist, slimy alien
punched up numbers on the control console with the fingers of one
webbed hand. "As soon as you latch down, I'll launch you."

<p>"Good." Raditz swung open the hatch and climbed in; as he did so,
the lights outside flickered briefly. "Perrfect," Raditz purred as he
reached up to pull the hatch down. He stopped abruptly.

<p>"Almost forgot," he muttered. "Hey, computer! Systems check!"

<p>Lights blinked for a few seconds. "POD 18434 LEVEL 1 DIAGNOSTICS
RESULTS: ALL SYSTEMS PASS. PRIMARY ENERGY STORAGE 100%. SECONDARY
ENERGY STORAGE 100%. HULL INTEGRITY: 100%"

<p>Raditz grinned and dogged the hatch down. "Sounds good to me! Ready
for launch."

<p>
CHU-CHUNK! The launching catapult tossed Raditz's pod high into the
atmosphere; its thrusters ignited well above the base, carrying him
into space and on his way to Base 79 and his fellow Saiyans.  Below
him, lights flickered and went out across Base 26.
<p>
Raditz leaned back and relaxed; it was so much less crowded without
the two coeurl kittens under his elbows. Raditz smirked; he hoped that
Dyarmin enjoyed his present. He'd put a lot of work into getting the
creatures home: spoon-feeding them potassium salts while keeping them
from eating him; teaching them to understand his language while
keeping them from eating him; and finally, while still keeping them
from eating him, instructing them on how their mother had destroyed an
entire base without getting caught. It had kept the long voyage back
from getting tedious.
<p>
Raditz wondered what would happen when someone finally went to see why
Base #29 stopped communicating.  The other three kittens should make
things interesting.  As it was, things should be getting <i>interesting</i>
back on Base #26 about now...
