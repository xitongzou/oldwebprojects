 boy with pointed ears and a sword is shown fighting a giant monster.
 He is defeated. The movie switches to present time. Gohan and Videl
 fight crime. After they capture some robbers they go back to class.
 Gohan receives a message and he and Videl head out. An old man is
 trying to commit suicide, but is rescued by Gohan. He presents them a
 box and asks if they can open it. Neither Gohan or Videl can. They
 take it home and even Goku can't open it. They gather the Dragonballs
 and wish the box would open. It opens and a tall man with a sword and
 ocarina comes out. He says they've made a big mistake by letting him
 out. He runs off to a nearby warehouse.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Trunks and Goten go into the warehouse,
 but are told to leave by the man, Tapion. At a cookout, trunks give
 him some food. Trunks brings him meals and thinks of him as the
 brother he never had, but is rejected. The next day a monster
 Hildegram reeks havoc on the city. It's only the legs of a monster
 though... Not even Gohan can stop it. Tapion appears and plays his
 Ocarina trapping it in him.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While Tapion is sleeping his Ocarina
 falls. He is attacked by the top half of a monster, but is able to
 grab his Ocarina. The old man who wanted to open the box Tapion was
 inside shows up. He tries to take the Ocarina, but Trunks shows up and
 grabs it. Tapion and the old man try to persuade Trunks, but Trunks
 yells, &quot;Bother catch!,&quot; and throws it to Tapion. The old man
 escapes and Trunks is about to leave, but Tapion asks if Trunks will
 eat with him. Trunks takes Tapion home the next day and shows him all
 his toys. Tapion puts Trunks to bed that night and is going to head
 back. Bulma says Tapion is welcome there, but he says he endangers
 them. He explains that on his planet, wise men summoned a monster
 called Hildegram from a statue. The monster reeked havoc on his
 planet, but it was stunned by Tapion and his brother playing their
 ocarinas. The monster was cut in half and each half was sealed inside
 of Tapion and his brother. For precautions, Tapion and his brother
 were each sealed in a magic box and sent off across space. Hildegrams
 legs were released meaning his brother was probably dead. Bulma says
 she'll make Tapion a box so that he can sleep without the full monster
 sealed inside him, escaping.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The next day Bulma finishes the box and
 Tapion goes to sleep in it. Somehow the monster escapes and continues
 to destroy the city. Tapion tries to seal it up in him, but it's too
 strong. Goku and Goten go Super Saiya-jin and attack. Gohan also
 attacks. They are all defeated. Vegeta awakens and is pissed off he is
 also defeated, but he manages to save some humans. Goten and Trunks
 fuse into Gotenks and go SSJ3, but they still cannot beat the monster.
 Tapion finally seals the monster and gives Trunks his sword. He tells
 Trunks to kill him. Trunks hesitates, but he knows he has to. He is
 too late, the monster escapes.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Goku knows the Earth is in trouble and
 goes SSJ3. Trunks uses Tapion's sword and tries to help, but Goku
 wants to fight alone. Goku uses his new technique called the
 Dragonfist and his arm turns into a dragon and goes right through
 Hildegrams giant body killing him.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Bulma makes a machine for Tapion to go
 home. Trunks is sad so Tapion gives Trunks his sword. Tapion leaves
 the Earth and the monster is gone.</font>
