<h3><b><font color="#2F69A8" face="Arial">Dragonball Z Ki</font></b>
</h3>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This section will tell you everything
 that you would ever need to know about ki. Unlike most sites where
 they provide a two-line equation that they have made up on how ki is
 sensed, we bring you detailed facts. Anyway, enjoy reading through
 them.</font></p>
 <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Ki Attacks<br>
 </font></b><font size="2" face="Arial">A ki attack is an energy beam, or ball, which is made by the attacker.
 The different attacks require different techniques to do. Most of them
 require great concentration, and arm movements which are very
 complicated. Different warriors tend to have their own signature
 attacks, such as the KameHameHa, Kai-o-kan, Spirit Bomb, Masenko, etc.
 The attacks can be used in battle, or be used to boost yourself up as
 you fall to the ground, should that scenario ever arise. ki can be
 used to dry off clothes, light fires, emit heat, and other things
 along those lines. To use a ki attack, you first must gather energy,
 and the more powerful you are, the faster you can do it.</font></p>
 <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Sensing Ki<br>
 </font></b><font size="2" face="Arial">Some
 people can sense ki without the use of any high-tech equipment. They
 close their eyes, look in the general direction of the power that they
 hope to sense, and try their best to feel it out. To sense the power,
 they must be searching for the approximate range that the power would
 go in, because if they search too high for example, they wouldn't be
 able to sense people with low power levels, such as people near to
 death.&nbsp; This is the primary requisite of many warriors, as they
 can sense how strong their opponents are. The problem with this is
 that you can't get the exact power, but can usually tell whether it is
 stronger, or weaker than your own though. The advantage is that it
 doesn't cost anything, unlike the expensive scouters. Using this
 method, they can dodge enemy attacks by sensing for their ki. Most
 humans, and Earthlings can use this skill, as can Vegeta, as he
 learned it from them. Most of the evil people are unable to use this
 ability though, because no one has taught it them, or they haven't
 picked up on it.</font></p>
 <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Scouters<br>
 </font></b><font size="2" face="Arial">This
 is another of reading ki levels. The scouter can measure the exact
 power level of anyone. All you have to do is focus it onto someone,
 and press a few buttons. It gives you a read out of the power level,
 and any special skills that this species of creature may have. The
 scouters fit like an earpiece, and go over the eye. Most have a type
 of green glass display screen. If it reads a power level that is
 either increasing faster than it can handle, or is too large for it to
 handle, then it makes a small explosion, causing the wearer to have to
 take it off, suffering no harm. Scouters are expensive though, and
 there is a fairly limited supply, meaning that once they get
 destroyed, it can be hard to get hold of another one immediately.
 Another function of the scouter is as a communication device. People
 can talk into them, transmitting their voice to others, even if they
 are on the other side of the galaxy. Scouters are probably better than
 using your senses.</font></p>
 <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Hiding ki<br>
 </font></b><font size="2" face="Arial">A
 select group of people are able to hide their ki, so it seems that
 they are a lot less powerful than they really are. This is a skill
 that Earthlings really excel in, and can be useful for throwing
 enemies off, and making them underestimate you. Vegeta has managed to
 master this, along with the Earthlings, as he has been a witness of
 them doing this, and managed to pick up on it. This technique has been
 utilized many times, and has fooled even the most intelligent enemies.&nbsp;</font>
