 Dragon*</b><o:p>
 </o:p>
 </font></span>&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A
 little purple dragon that first appears in DBZ Movie 3, where he befriends
 Gohan after the boy rescues him from a forest fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>In the Japanese and original Pioneer dub of the movie, the dragon is
 simply called Haiya Dragon, but later the FUNimation dub changes the name to
 Icarus for some reason.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The dragon also appears in Movies 4 and 5, and even in the anime series
 during the Garlic Junior Saga.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Commonly associated with Gohan, Haiya Dragon is usually portrayed with
 Gohan riding his back.<o:p>

 </b></font></span>&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A
 creature resembling a green butt with a face and antenna who is stranded in
 Penguin Village along with his servant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>In his spare time he either attempts to conquer the Earth, or simply
 builds a spaceship in order to get back to his home planet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Though his servant is bright, Niko-chan himself is a bumbling idiot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>In the Dragonball manga, he appears briefly giving the victory sign,
 although his part is bigger in the anime series.<o:p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2">Hildegarn
 - “Hirudegaan”*<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </font></span>&nbsp;</b> <font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A
 gigantic monster in DBZ Movie 13, he was created by evil sorcerers who cast a
 spell of negative energy on a menacing stone statue and brought it to life more
 than 1,000 years ago on the planet Konatsu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Hildegarn was never defeated, for killing him was almost impossible, but
 a spell was cast upon the monster that caused him to be split in half so that
 his power would be dismantled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>With the same spell, the top half was sealed inside the body of the
 planet’s legendary warrior Tapion, while the bottom half was hidden inside
 his little brother Minosha.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Hildegarn’s lower half manages to get loose and steps on Minosha,
 killing the boy in the beginning of the movie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Hoi convinces Goku and the others to help him find the dragonballs to
 rescue Tapion from his prison, but in reality the wish opens the Oracle that
 sealed the warrior, and starts the process of Hildegarn’s restoration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>After undergoing a metamorphosis, Hildegarn emerges as a more powerful
 creature with the ability to fly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>This monster is tangible only when attacking, otherwise Hildegarn can
 instantly teleport away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He is defeated by Goku with his most powerful physical move in the
 anime/movie storyline, Ryu Ken or Dragon Fist.<o:p>

 two Saiyajin who battle Tien, Chaozu, Krillin and Yamcha in the Pendulum Room,
 or the Dream Chamber.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>One is short and bald with light skin, while the other is taller, has
 hair and is darker skinned; both are ugly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>They are simulated in order for Earth’s warriors to test their skills
 and see how well they can actually do against the estimated strength of a
 Saiyajin in the field.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Janemba
 - “Janenba”*</b><o:p>
 </o:p>
 </font></span>&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The
 main villain of DBZ Movie 12, he is created when a young ogre guarding the Soul
 Cleansing Machine in the Afterlife fails to keep his watch and doesn’t notice
 when the machine begins to overflow, until it explodes and spews out pure evil
 everywhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>The
 evil is of such great magnitude that it possesses the boy and causes him to
 transform into a huge monster, becoming the embodiment of evil who calls
 himself Janemba.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>In his first form, he resembles a gigantic, fat yellow baby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Fans often refer to him as “The God of Pokemon” for one reason - he
 only says a single word in the entire movie, which he repeats over and over:
 his name.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>He
 doesn’t appear all that powerful or menacing, but he manages to seal King
 Yama’s Palace in a strong force field that can only be broken by cursing and
 violent threats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Janemba also breaks the barrier between the Afterlife and Earth,
 releasing every villain and restless spirit who has been defeated or killed in
 the past upon the world, including Frieza and the Ginyu Force.<o:p>

 Goku and Vegeta face him in Hell, they appear to nearly defeat him, until they
 realize in horror that Janemba has only transformed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He becomes a red and purple devil-like creature and wields an impressive
 katana and a menacing countenance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </span>Janemba shrinks a bit when he transforms, although he is still much
 taller than Goku and Vegeta.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Unlike his first form, he doesn’t speak at all, but only laughs at the
 Saiyajin who think they can defeat him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Janemba holds a wide variety of techniques for a movie villain,
 including a form of Instant Transmission, or teleportation, where he phases out
 in block-like particles, giving the scene a video game-like effect, and travels
 through a hole in space and time to reappear nearby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Vegeta and Goku defeat him by fusing into Gogeta, who whips Janemba
 around until he explodes, leaving only a dazed young ogre where he once stood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

 accent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>Jeice’s
 specialty is his combination of speed and powerful energy attacks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He lasts longer in the series than the other members of the Ginyu Force
 (except Ginyu), and is finally killed by a hand-blast from Vegeta.</span></font>
