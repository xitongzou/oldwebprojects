              23rd Tenkaichi Budoukai - Review</font></b></font></p>
            <p>The 23rd Tenkaichi Budoukai </p>
            <p>Held in 756 A.D., the 23rd Tenakichi Budoukai had a total of 72 
              competitors. As in the previous Budoukai, Chouzo uses his Telepathic 
              skills so that he can pick who goes in each bracket. </p>
            <p>Preliminary Rounds </p>
            <p>Gokuh's first match is against King Chop-ou, a man who he had defeated 
              in the preliminary round of the previous years Budoukai. Gokuh has 
              just gotten done with his training under Kami, so everyone is excited 
              to see how much he has learned. At the beginning of the fight Gokuh 
              just stands still, but when King Chop-ou attack Gokuh, Gokuh goes 
              behind him so quickly that no one sees it. So, when Chop-ou turns 
              around he gets knocked out by Gokuh. </p>
            <p>In Chouzo's match he fights the Cyborg Tai Pai Pai and ends up 
              getting killed by the assasin. Chouzo is the only Z fighter not 
              to advance to the finals. </p>
            <p>In the final match we see for the Preliminary rounds, Shien fights 
              against Yajorobie. Yajarobie is in costume, so no one knows who 
              he is and Shien is actually Kami in a human body. As the fight begins, 
              Shien is a dorky looking man and he rushs at Yajorobie, but he trips. 
              When he gets back up, though, he punches Yajorobie and knocks him 
              out to win the match. </p>
            <p>The 8 Block Finals </p>
            <p>The first match has Tenshinhan fighting against Cyborg Tao Pai 
              Pai. When the fight begins both fighters seem confident. It is easy 
              to tell once the fight begins, though, that Tenshinhan is in control. 
              In anger, Tao Pai Pai uses a blade in his arm in an attempt to kill 
              Tenshinhan. Tao Pai Pai is disqualified, but he keeps going. However, 
              Tenshinhan ends up knocking him out in one blow. </p>
            <p>The nextv match has Gokuh vs. Chi Chi, but Gokuh is not aware of 
              who the girl is. Gokuh is told that unless he wins he will not be 
              told of who she is. Gokuh uses air to blow her out of the ring and 
              after the match finds out that it is Chi Chi and that he had promised 
              to marry her. </p>
            <p>Kurrin has been paired up with Ma Junior for the next fight. Ma 
              Junior is actually Piccolo. Kuririn tries everything he has, but 
              is not strong enough to defeat Ma Junior. Kuririn uses a Kame Hame 
              Ha, but Piccolo uses One Pattern to teleport behind Kuririn and 
              knock him out. </p>
            <p>In the final match of the 8 man round we see Yamucha up against 
              Shien. At the beginning of the match, Shien makes it look like he 
              is getting in a bunch of lucky attacks, but finally the two fighters 
              get serious. Shein is too fast and too powerful for Yamucha and 
              throughout the whole match Shien is giving Yamucha tips on how to 
              fight. FInally, Shien knocks Yamucha out of the ring. </p>
            <p>The Final Four </p>
            <p>The first of the second round matches has Tenshinhan fighting Gokuh. 
              At first the two fighters appear to be even, but then Gokuh takes 
              a break so that he can take off all of his weighted clothing and 
              from that point on Gokuh dominated the match. Tenshinhan uses a 
              technique which splits him into four different bodies, but Gokuh 
              uses Taioken on the four and then knocks them all out of the ring 
              to win the match. </p>
            <p>In the final match of the second round we get to see Ma Junior 
              and Shien go at it. At the beginning of the match, Shien takes Piccolo 
              by surprise with his strength and it appears that the two fighters 
              are evenly matched. Ma Junior also wants to know how Shien knows 
              so much about him. The two fighters take a break to talk, but in 
              the namek language. Shien then pulls out the Denshi Jar and prepares 
              to do Mafuu Ba, but Ma Junior replies with Mafuuba also and takes 
              Kami out his human body and wins the match when the human body falls 
              unconscious. </p>
            <p>The Final Match </p>
            <p>Gokuh vs. Piccolo is the final match of the 23rd Tenkaichi Budoukai. 
              The two fighters are too fast for everyone to follow, but it appears 
              as though Ma Junior is in the lead. Piccolo then goes to use an 
              attack, but since it will kill a lot of people who are watching, 
              Gokuh draws the attack to him, but Piccolo misses. Gokuh then uses 
              his Chou Kame Hame Ha, but it is not enough to kill Piccolo. After 
              this attack is when Ma Junior announces that he is actually Piccolo. 
              Everyone in the stands leaves and now just a few people are left 
              behind. Piccolo then uses an attack which makes him grow super big. 
              Gokuh however uses a Kame Hame Ha to propel himself into Piccolo's 
              Mouth and when he comes back out he has the Denshi Jar which Piccolo 
              had swolled earlier. The Denshi Jar is then opened and Kami is released. 
              After some more fighting, Piccolo has broken or severly injured 
              all of Gokuh's body. As Piccolo is about to Kill Gokuh however we 
              see that Gokuh has learned how to fly and he flies into Piccolo 
              and knocks him out of the ring. So, this means that Gokuh has won 
              the match and is the strongest man in the world. </p>
