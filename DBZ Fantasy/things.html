              That DBZGT characters would never say</font></b></p>
            <p>Goku:(To Chi-Chi) No I'm realy not hungry<br>
              Goku: &quot;Vegeta, you should reconsider. Knight to C-6 allows 
              for mate in 14<br>
              moves.&quot;<br>
              Goku: &quot;Chi-chi, I've had enough with this<br>
              'my-son-has-to-study-every-damn-day' bullshit.&quot;<br>
              Goku: &quot;No, please. I couldn't eat another bite!&quot;<br>
              Goku: &quot;Well, this guy is clearly invincible and we don't stand 
              a chance. I<br>
              give up.&quot;<br>
              Goku: &quot;Are you just using me for my body, Chi-chi?&quot;<br>
              Goku: &quot;I'm converting to Judaism.&quot;<br>
              Goku: &quot;Did you know that in some countries in Africa, children 
              don't even<br>
              have enough food to live?&quot;<br>
              Goku: &quot;Chi-chi, for our anniversary, I got reservations at 
              the most<br>
              exclusive restaurant in town. Afterwards, we can take luxuriously 
              calm<br>
              carriage ride through the park, and retire in the hot springs of 
              Hakone.&quot;<br>
              Goku: *after SSJ transformation* &quot;Whoa, the legend is true! 
              My head isn't<br>
              the only part with golden hair!&quot;<br>
              Gohan: &quot;You guys never listen to me! You're the worst parents 
              ever!&quot;<br>
              Gohan: &quot;Yesterday I smoked pot.&quot;<br>
              Gohan: &quot;Leave me alone, I'm spanking the dolphin!&quot;<br>
              Gohan: &quot;Woodland creatures make me horny.&quot;<br>
              Gohan: &quot;Mom! Just shut the hell for a second and listen to 
              me!&quot;<br>
              Goten: &quot;I can't get any play!&quot;<br>
              Chi-chi: &quot;Goku, I love you for who you are, and you're perfect!&quot;<br>
              Chi-chi: &quot;C'mon Goku, let's go do a little 'sparring' together&quot; 
              *wink*<br>
              Chi-chi: &quot;Gokuu, the firmness of your body is truly exciting 
              me.&quot;<br>
              Mr. Popo: &quot;Kami-sama, after much thought, I've decided to join 
              the Nation of<br>
              Islam.&quot;<br>
              Kami-sama: &quot;Actually, I never really liked that 'Goku' character 
              from day<br>
              one.&quot;<br>
              Vegeta: &quot;This blush really accentuates my cheeckbones.&quot;<br>
              Vegeta: &quot;Wow, with life perspective, this whole 'saiya-jin 
              pride'<br>
              mumbo-jumbo seems totally pointless.&quot;<br>
              Vegeta: &quot;You know what they say about guys wil big foreheads...&quot;<br>
              Vegeta: &quot;To make up for all I've done, I'm going to become 
              a charity worker<br>
              for children's aid.&quot;<br>
              Vegeta: &quot;Gokuu, I think it's time I came out of the closet. 
              I've been<br>
              attracted to you since the day we met, but with all the pressures 
              of<br>
              society, I was unable to express my true feelings for fear of rejection.<br>
              Instead, I channeled all my anger at society towards you. Wow, it's 
              great to<br>
              get that off my chest. Can we still have a meaningful relationship?&quot;<br>
              Vegeta: &quot;Bulma, I'm beginning to doubt my ability to... perform.&quot;<br>
              Vegeta: &quot;I really ought to see a barber.&quot;<br>
              Vegeta: &quot;Wow, pulling nosehairs is tremendously painful!&quot;<br>
              Vegeta: &quot;Oh sure, I may act macho, but *sob* deep down, I'm 
              really<br>
              sensitive, and I'm hurting.&quot;<br>
              Brolly: &quot;Maybe I should lay off the Weight Gainer's 2000 formula.&quot;<br>
              Brolly: &quot;You know what would be really cool? Imagine what I 
              would look like<br>
              with red contact lenses!&quot;<br>
              Paragus: &quot;Hey, Brolly, get this! Your name resembles the word 
              Broccoli, and<br>
              mine resembles Asparagus! Guess we have more in common than being 
              father and<br>
              son, eh?&quot;<br>
              Kuririn: &quot;I am SO sexy.&quot;<br>
              Kuririn: &quot;All my life I've been in Goku's shadow. This is going 
              to end here<br>
              and now!&quot;<br>
              Kuririn: &quot;Perhaps I should reconcile with Piccolo in order 
              to lead a less<br>
              stressful life.&quot;<br>
              Kuririn: &quot;Wow, I never noticed it before, but my head bears 
              an incredibly<br>
              strong resemblance to a bowling ball!&quot;<br>
              Mutenroshi: &quot;Kuririn, please. I'm not interested in lurid pictures 
              of<br>
              women.&quot;<br>
              Mutenroshi: &quot;No, it's OK Bulma. Put your bra back on and let's 
              talk this<br>
              through.&quot;<br>
              Bulma: &quot;Alright Roshi, you, me, and the bathroom. Let's go!&quot;<br>
              Bulma: &quot;I could drop you like a sac of potatoes!&quot;<br>
              Bulma: &quot;Computer? What the hell is that?&quot;<br>
              Bulma: &quot;I'm considering going with a more conversative, brunette 
              look.&quot;<br>
              Piccolo: &quot;For Halloween, I'm going to dress up as myself.&quot;<br>
              Piccolo: &quot;Sometimes I worry about being emotionally unstable.&quot;<br>
              Piccolo: &quot;Cowardice really turns me on.&quot;<br>
              Piccolo: *Points towards to women in a quarrel* &quot;Catfight! 
              Mee-oww!&quot;<br>
              Piccolo: &quot;My therapist says I need a vacation. I'm thinking 
              about Hawaii.&quot;<br>
              Piccolo: &quot;Damn, Chi-chi is a FOX!&quot;<br>
              Dende: &quot;I feel like doing something really evil.&quot;<br>
              Cell: &quot;Fighting sucks. Let's go to the movies.&quot;<br>
              Cell: &quot;Goku, I swear! You are the living image of my ex!&quot;<br>
              Cell: &quot;...for better or for worse. Until death do us part...&quot;<br>
              Cell: &quot;Onigiri, enough for everyone! I made them myself!&quot;<br>
              Buu: &quot;I wish I were an Oscar Meyer weiner! That is what I'd 
              really like to be...&quot;<br>
              Nappa: &quot;Am I cute or what?&quot;<br>
              Radditz: &quot;My secret? Well let's just say that every serious 
              fighter starts their day with Cheerios.&quot;<br>
              Captain Ginyuu: &quot;Alright Goku! We'll start on 3. Remember, 
              let's keep this fight fair and square.&quot;<br>
              Kaio-sama: &quot;Do I really sound like that?&quot;<br>
              Kaio-sama: &quot;I've been thinking it over, and well, my jokes 
              really aren't cutting it anymore.&quot;<br>
              Kaio-sama: &quot;Did any of you see Seinfeld last night? Now THAT 
              was funny!&quot;<br>
              Kaio-sama: &quot;I'm a fat half-catfish-half-man with a bad sense 
              of humor and ugly sunglasses.&quot;</p>
