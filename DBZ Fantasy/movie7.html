 <h3><font face="Arial" color="#2F69A8">Dragonball Z Movie 7: The Three
 Great Super-Saiya-Jins</font></h3>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><b><font color="#808080" face="Arial">Summary:</font><font color="#808080" face="Arial" size="2"><br>
 </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">Android 17 is killing his own
 creator Dr. Gero, while his sister, Android 18 looks on. After
 succeeding in the violent act, the two rebellious cyborgs take flight,
 and we see a large trail of Gero's blood seeping into a crack on the
 floor. This leads to the lower floor of the compound where the
 Doctor's computer works tirelessly on his ultimate creation, Cell. In
 the background, there loom three unopened chambers, marked in
 succeeding order, 13, 14, and 15...</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cut to the mall, where Trunks, Krillin,
 Muten Roshi, and Oolong are waiting a bit impatiently for the 'Miss
 Prettiest Girl in the World Contest'. As it doesn't start for several
 hours, they all have their own little perverted fantasies about the
 girls, (except Trunks, he's a nice young man, ya hear?)</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Anyway, Goku and Gohan are shopping
 with Chi Chi, and beginning to wonder why women shop so much. Gohan
 decides that it's her special way of relieving stress. With that, Chi
 Chi throws Goku a few dozen more boxes to carry.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Suddenly, there is panic in the
 streets, as two strange people are destroying all that gets in there
 way. The two beings don't appear human, as the shorter of the two has
 a maroon tone to his skin, and the tall, muscular one has a complexion
 that of stone. It seems they are indiscriminately clearing a path
 towards the mall.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Krillin, Roshi, Oolong, and Trunks have
 all met up with Chi Chi, Gohan, and Goku, at a restaurant, having
 found out that the beauty contest wasn't until the next day. A huge
 explosion interrupts their meal, as the entire top of the building
 explodes sending the crew flying. Goku tries to figure out who could
 be capable of such an onslaught, and he notices the two people from
 earlier charging up ki blasts. He instructs the others to leave the
 city, as he believes them to only be after him. This holds true, as he
 learns that they are actually creations of Dr. Gero sent to
 assassinate him.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">They proceed to fight, putting Goku at
 a disadvantage, having to battle two powerful creatures at once.
 Trunks comes to his aid, and suggests they take their fight away from
 the city and to an abandoned polar region in the north. They fly off
 with the androids in hot pursuit. Gohan and Krillin look on, and
 wonder if they would be of any use in this fight. Gohan decides that
 even if it is against his mother's wishes, he has to try and help, so
 that his father will have a better chance at surviving the battle.
 Krillin doesn't want to follow, but Chi Chi gives him a swift kick in
 the ass that sends him flying that way.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Back to Gero's lab: The chambers marked
 14 and 15 have been opened, thus ensuring that the two creatures seen
 earlier were in fact the design of Gero. Abruptly, the chamber labeled
 13 begins to flash, and open, revealing yet another android. A shadowy
 figure who, just like the others before him, only utters the phrase
 'Son Goku'...</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the arctic tundra, Trunks and Goku
 have begun the assault on the two androids, which are leaving them a
 bit dazed. A voice from above is heard. It turns out to be the new
 android, a lean, tall, white-haired model, and he seems unimpressed by
 Goku's fighting abilities. They wonder just how many robots Gero made,
 and number 13 explains that it wasn't Gero who made them, but the
 computer itself. It had amplified the Doctor's hatred for our hero,
 several times, and they were the end result. He hits Goku with a large
 Ki beam, which throws him down into the icy depths.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Trunks is doing his best to fend off 14
 (big one) and 15 (small one), but they're just too much for him. 13
 Fires his powerful S.S. Dead Bomb, but Vegeta suddenly intervenes, and
 joins in the fight. He takes on 15, while Trunks continues to attack
 14, and Goku trades licks with 13. He is quick to warn the androids
 that they've been underestimating them all along. With that, they all
 three go Super Saiya-jin, raising each of their powers far beyond the
 comprehension of the androids. This pleases Gohan and Krillin as they
 look on to see that they're back in the game.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Gohan decides to fire a blast at number
 13, which does little more than catch his attention and make him send
 another right back. It is blocked however, by Piccolo! He rushes onto
 the scene and assists Goku in the struggle.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Vegeta is still in combat with 15, when
 the android suddenly explodes from severe damage, leaving a mess of
 computer chips its wake. Trunks slices 14 in half with his sword,
 destroying it as well. All of the warriors congregate around the now
 lone, 13, and prepare to strike. But, wait, it seems 13 has an unusual
 ability. He is able to absorb the two processors and CPU's left behind
 from the destruction of 14 and 15. As a result, he becomes a sort of
 Super 13, a pumped-up version of himself that takes on a blue skin
 tone with spiky red hair and yellow eyes.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Being the glory hog he is, Vegeta
 attacks Super 13 with all his might, does absolutely no damage, and is
 beaten literally into the ground. Trunks tries to help his father, but
 is quickly sent crashing into a mountain at breakneck speed by one of
 13's blasts. Piccolo is easily disposed of, and even Goku doesn't seem
 to stand much of a chance. 13 has seemingly become far too powerful to
 deal with now.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Goku could've easily stayed down.
 Nothing he could do anyway, correct? Yeah right. It's Genki Dama time.
 Slowly but surely, the energy ball gained in size, all the while
 Trunks and Vegeta are doing their best to use what strength they have
 left to buy Goku all the time he needs. Piccolo jumps in and grabs 13,
 steering his Dead Bomb away from his path, and says exactly what we're
 all thinking, &quot;Goku, Show him what a Super Saiya-jin is made
 of!!&quot;</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With that, Goku transforms to Super
 Saiya-jin mode, and Krillin brings it to our attention that he can't
 use a Genki Dama in that form, since his heart is full of hatred. It
 turns out that he doesn't throw it at all, he actually absorbs it
 within himself, creating an ultra power stasis around his body, and
 melting all of the surrounding ice. When 13 tries to punch him, his
 hands begin to disintegrate. Goku eventually punches straight through
 his stomach, sending 13 flying backwards and eventually turning to
 nothing but dust.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After the battle, Goku gathers up the
 others and takes them on a boat ride home. The scene switches to a
 hospital, where Gohan and Krillin are bandaged up and many of the
 others are standing around talking with them. Gohan asks what happened
 to Vegeta and Piccolo after the battle, and his dad tells him that
 'knowing those two, they're just fine.'</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The scene switches to Vegeta and
 Piccolo afloat on a small iceberg, sitting with their backs turned to
 one another.</font></p>
 <p><b><font color="#808080" face="Arial">My Two Cents:</font><font color="#808080" face="Arial" size="2"><br>
 </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">While not my favorite
 Dragonball movie as a whole, this one is certainly one of my
 favorites. The animation is really great, and the characters are well
 drawn. There were four new enemy designs for this movie, and
 surprisingly, they're all interesting.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The biggest problem is the lack of a
 storyline of any quality. It couldn't have taken too long to write
 this one up. It was pretty much just a big fight scene, but that's not
 to say that this fight scene isn't fun to watch. At any length, this
 is a great movie to show to your friends if you want to introduce them
 to Dragonball. It'll certainly hold their interest.</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So here's my score:</font></p>
 <p><font face="Arial" size="2">7 out of 10</font></p>
