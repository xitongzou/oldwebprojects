The Wrong Ones to Know Fusion<br><br>
<font size="2">
<ul>
<li>In Hell<br><br>

<li>Piccolo: Bebi stay away from me or I'll attack.<br><br>

<li>Bebi: You know you don't have enough strength as me.<br><br>

<li>All of a sudden Bebi goes in Piccolo's body.  So now Piccolo
is possessed.<br><br>

<li>Bebi: Use your telepathic powers to talk to Dende.  Then tell him
to collect Dragon Balls.<br><br>

<li>Piccolo: Dende!  Gather up Dragon Balls.<br><br>

<li>Dende: What for Piccolo?<br><br>

<li>Piccolo: I'll tell you when you gather them.<br><br>

<li>The Next Day<br><br>

<li>Dende: Got them Piccolo<br><br>

<li>Piccolo: The other day I talked telepathically to see
how Gokou was doing and he said he wanted to have rematches
against Bebi,The small Majin Buu, and Cell.<br><br>

<li>Dende: Are you sure.  I don't think so.<br><br>

<li>Piccolo: I swear, don't worry about it you know Vegeta 
and Gokou have their new tecnics Super Saiyan 4.<br><br>

<li>Dende: Yes that is true.  OK.  I call upon Shenron.  I have a
wish and would like you to grant it.<br><br>

<li>Shenron: SSSSSaaaaaYYYYY wish.<br><br>

<li>Dende: Gokou would like to have rematch fight
against Bebi, The kid Majin Buu, and Cell so 
would u please take them out of hell.<br><br>

<li>Shenron: Don't like it, but your wish has been granted.<br><br>

<li>Commercial Break<br><br>
 
<li>Then all of a sudden lightning starts coming out of the sky.
Bebi, kid Majin Buu, and Cell fly out of the sky.<br><br>

<li>SMB: hehehehe!<br><br>

<li>Cell: yyyyyyyeeeeeesssss!<br><br>

<li>Bebi: Ok guys I'll go in one of Gokou's friends body
and ask him about 3 ways Fusion.<br><br>

<li>Bebi goes flying around and finds Yamcha.  <br><br>

<li>Bebi: Hey yamcha<br><br>

<li>Yamcha: UUUUhhhhh!<br><br>

<li>Yamcha attacks, Bebi knees him in the stomach and goes in his body
through his back.  Bebi flys to Gokou's house in Yamcha's body.<br><br>

<li>Gokou: Hey Yamcha come in.<br><br>

<li>Yamcha: I only came here to ask you something.  How do you
do 3 way Fusion.<br><br>

<li>Gokou: Why?<br><br>

<li>Yamcha: Because Teshinan, Krillin, and I want to do it.<br><br>

<li>Gokou tells him<br><br>

<li>Yamcha: OK thanks Gokou see you next time.<br><br>

<li>Gokou No prob. Bye Yamcha.<br><br>

<li>Yamcha walks out the door and Gokou closes it.  Bebi gets
out of Yamcha's body and his body falls to the ground.<br><br>

<li>Bebi: Yes! I got it,Hehehehe<br><br>

<li>And he flys away.  Gokou opens the door.<br><br>

<li>Gokou: Yamcha you forgot something.  Huh!  Gokou checks him.<br><br>

<li>Bebi: I got the technique.<br><br>

<li>Cell: Yes we will be unstoppable.<br><br>

<li>SMB: hehehe<br><br>

<li>Bebi: Let's do it!<br><br>

The Wrong Ones Who Knows Fusion Part 2<br><br>
<font size="2">
<ul>
<li>Hurry Gohan were waiting for You<br><br>

<li>Baby,Cell,Kid Buu: FFFFFuuuuu-SSSIIIIIOOOOONNNNN-Ha!<br><br>

<li>They finish the fusion.  Then they go to attack the city to get Gokou and the
others there.  All of them do.  Gokou,Gohan,Goten,Trunks,Vegeta and Ubuu.<br><br>

<li>BCMB(short for Baby,Cell,Kid Majin Buu):Gokou you told us how to do three way
Fusion.  Or should i say you gave it to Yamcha.  Hahahaha!<br><br>

<li>Gokou: OOOOhhhhhhh you snicky bastard.<br><br>

<li>Gokou powers up to Super Sayian 4 and attacks.  BCMB stands there and waits
until to punch.  Gokou does BCMB blocks it and gives him a fast punch.<br><br>

<li>Gokou: Oh no!  Were not strong enough.<br><br>

<li>Vegeta: Kakarotto what are you talking about when i power up to SS4 and we do
fusion.  We get more powerful, then we should be as strong as those three.<br><br>

<li>Gokou: No were not Vegeta, but I have an idea.  You know we both had tails
along time ago.  Right Vegeta!<br><br>

<li>Vegeta: yea<br><br>

<li>Gokou: So did my son when he was a kid.  If he get's his tail pull out again
like we did he could turn into a SS4 too.  Then we could do the three way
Fusion with him.<br><br>

<li>Gokou tells his son and Gohan flys off.  Vegeta powers up and turns to SS4
also. Then both of them do Fusion and attack.  <br><br>

<li>Commercial Break<br><br>

<li>Everybody else is watching Gogeta4 and BCMB fight.  It's a good fight, but
it's more tilted out on BCMB side.<br><br>

<li>Cut to Kame's Home<br><br>

<li>Gohan: Hey Dende and Mr. Popo can you pull out my tail like it use to be.<br><br>

<li>Dende: Sure we will try.<br><br>

<li>They gets some pliars and try to pull it out, but it's no good.  Krillin heard
about the news and shows up.<br><br>

<li>Krillin: Hey I heard your trying to get that little piece of your tail sticking
out your butt so it stretches.  So then you could power up to SS4 too.<br><br>

<li>Gohan: Yup<br><br>

<li>All three of them work on it.  But it only comes out and inch.  Gohan tells
them to power up then try.  They do that and starts pulling, now it's coming
out inch by inch.<br><br>  

<li>Gohan: It's done.<br><br>

<li>Krillin: Woohoo I'm exausted.<br><br>

<li>Mr. Popo: Here take these senzu beans.<br><br>

<li>Gohan: Thank you<br><br>

<li>He flys off somewhere there's no people because he knows he going to go on a
rampage when he turns into a golden monkey.  He does.<br><br>

<li>Back to the fight.  Gokou and Vegeta are lieing on the ground not in SS4 or in
Fusion.  Trunks, Goten, and Ubuu go to attack.<br><br>

<li>Gohan: Wait!<br><br>

<li>He's coming down from the sky with a tail sticking out.  He gives his father
and vegita a senzu bean.  Both get up.<br><br>

<li>Gokou: Gohan you did it.<br><br>

<li>Gohan: Yup<br><br>

<li>then they start powering up<br><br>

<li>Gokou, Vegeta, Gohan: AAAAAAWWWWWWW<br><br>

<li>All turn SS4<br><br>

<li>To be continued<br><br>
