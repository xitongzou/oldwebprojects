 - “Gariku”*<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </b></span>&nbsp; Father of Garlic Jr., he competed with the original Piccolo
 for the throne of Kami.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
 original Piccolo was chosen over Garlic because unlike Piccolo, Garlic held
 evil ambitions that soon became apparent to the previous Kami.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Garlic resented the decision, and created an army of evil demons that he
 led right to Kami’s tower in order to overthrow him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>However, Kami, who had by now split away from his evil half, defeated
 him and, according to Kami in DBZ Movie 1, Garlic was cast into the realm of
 darkness, a negative space from which he would never return.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>However, in the Garlic Junior Saga, a flashback recaps the scene of
 Garlic forcefully trying to take the throne, revealing that Garlic was sealed
 in an orb similar to the type of bottle that Garlic used to capture and contain
 Kami and Mr. Popo with, except that the orb is in a 3-dimensional Star-of-David
 shape, and instead of clear, the orb is opaque and pitch black.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>One may infer that Garlic was kept in that orb for the remainder of his
 life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After taking over
 Kami’s Palace, Garlic appears to “pray” to the orb, assumed to contain
 his father’s remains, considering the orb was never broken from the time that
 Garlic was first sealed inside it several hundred years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Because Garlic Junior makes no attempts to crack or break the orb and
 release his father, one may presume that his father, a mere mortal, is long
 dead inside the orb.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The strange
 part is, in the series, Garlic Junior verbalizes his desire to wish his father
 back to life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One has to wonder at
 the logic in obtaining the dragonballs to wish someone back who has been dead
 far longer than the allotted year’s limit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>But then, how could Garlic Junior have known?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>No big surprise, because after all, it is only a filler saga.</font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><b>Garlic
 Junior - “Gariku Jyuniya”*</b><o:p>
 </o:p>
 &nbsp; The son of Garlic, he desires revenge on the present Kami for taking the
 throne of Kami, or Guardian of Earth (basically God), from his father and then,
 according to DBZ Movie 1, sealing his father in a “Deadzone”.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>As the main villain of the movie, Garlic Junior gathers all
 the dragonballs, including the four-star dragonball on Gohan’s hat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>His henchman decide to nab the kid too while they’re at it, hence the
 name of the movie, “Return My Gohan!”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Goku goes to Garlic Junior’s castle to retrieve his son, only to find
 that Garlic Junior has already made the wish for eternal life, and is about to
 finish Kami when Goku interrupts him and takes him on instead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Piccolo joins with Goku (just this once, according to Piccolo), but when
 Garlic Junior transforms, even the two combined aren’t strong enough to stop
 the immortal Garlic Junior.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then
 to everyone’s surprise, the young Gohan, who is about 4, powers up in a
 terrible rage and with a tremendous burst of power, he blows Garlic Junior into
 the deadzone that he had stupidly created.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Garlic Junior returns in the anime after the Frieza Saga with a plot to
 take over the world using a magic potion called the Black-water Mist, which
 causes anyone who comes into contact with it to become a minion of darkness and
 do Garlic Junior’s evil bidding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Gohan,
 Piccolo, and Krillin all take him on as Garlic opens up yet another Deadzone,
 but this time, he uses it to bring the Makyo Star, a small planet which gives
 off evil power, closer to Earth, an act which makes Garlic Junior and his
 minions even stronger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Gohan
 appears to barely defeat him as he fires a great blast that hurls Garlic Junior
 into the Deadzone again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(Does
 anyone see a pattern here?)<o:p>

 G2006, and he befriends the gang quickly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>At one point early on, he eats the Dragonball Radar that the three had
 brought along to absorb energy, and consequently, Gill acquires the ability to
 locate dragonballs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The little

 &nbsp; Piccolo’s driving instructor, she is cutesy and somewhat flirtatious
 when Piccolo first meets her, but when he starts the car and gets on the road,
 she turns into a crazed, road-raging maniac.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>She’s only satisfied when, after he is taunted by Goku, Piccolo drives
 like a maniac himself to catch up with Goku and pass him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

 road after Goku and crashes.<o:p>

 </o:p>
 &nbsp; The leader of the Ginyu Force, the elite squad of fighters that serve
 directly under Frieza.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ginyu is by
 far the strongest, with a power level of 120,000, but he is no match for Goku.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Ginyu realizes this early on, and plays his cards well, as he fools Goku
 into thinking he will give up soon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then
 as Goku watches in horror, Ginyu inflicts a terrible wound upon his own body,
 then uses his only special ability (besides interpretive dance, anyway) which
 is the power to switch bodies with anyone of his choosing, by calling out the
 words “Change now!”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
 successfully trades bodies with Goku and flies off in search of the dragonballs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Ginyu’s trick fools Gohan and Kryllan at first, who do not realize
 what happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Vegeta is the first
 to figure it out, and watches as Gohan and Kryllan fight Ginyu in Goku’s
 body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Later a weakened Goku
 arrives on the scene to announce that Ginyu has not mastered his fighting
 technique inside Goku’s body, and so he is still vulnerable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>The others gang up on him, until he is forced to attempt the body switch
 on Vegeta, though Goku jumps in the way right before the beam hits Vegeta, and
 Ginyu is stuck in his old body again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Vegeta
 takes advantage of this and proceeds to beat Ginyu to a bloody pulp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Ginyu tries the body switch on Vegeta one last time, but at the last
 second, a still-weakened Goku throws a frog right in the path of the beam, and
 Ginyu instead changes bodies with a Namekian frog.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>For the remainder of the Frieza saga, Ginyu becomes more of a
 comedy-relief character.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He meets
 up with Bulma and changes bodies with her for a brief while, until Gohan
 figures out what happened and uses the same trick Goku used earlier with Bulma
 in the frog’s body, and Ginyu is a frog once more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>He somehow survives the entire ordeal because Dende’s wish for
 everyone to be transported to Earth counts him in as well, and he lives on to
 rule a nearby pond within the Capsule Corp. grounds.<o:p>

 strong, with many techniques, all of which Goku eventually counters until Giran
 finally forfeits the match to Goku.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
 the anime, there is an earlier scene before the tournament where Giran goes to

 - “Gojiita”*</b><o:p>
 </o:p>
 &nbsp; One of the most powerful characters in all of Dragonball/Z/GT, Gogeta is
 the result of the fusion of Goku and Vegeta.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Gogeta appears only in DBZ Movie 12, “Rebirth of Fusion!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Goku and Vegeta!!”, and in GT.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Goku
 and Vegeta must perform the fusion dance, a technique taught to Goku by Kami,
 in order to become a warrior many times more powerful than either Goku or
 Vegeta alone.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Gogeta is a totally different person, and so his personality
 is completely different than either of the two Saiyajin that fused to become
 him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Gogeta’s power is simply
 enormous as he takes out Janemba effortlessly in DBZ Movie 12 after reaching
 Super Saiyajin 2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By GT, his power
 is almost beyond comprehension as Super Saiyajin 4 Goku and Vegeta fuse to
 create Super Saiyajin 4 Gogeta, probably the most powerful character in the
 entire history of the series.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
 special attack is Big Bang Kamehameha.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
 only reason that Gogeta does not completely obliterate Ii Shenlong (the
 one-star Shenlong) is because of his own cockiness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Gogeta toys with the Dragon and wastes time until he defuses (after the
 set half-hour fusion limit) before he can finish One-star Shenlong.<o:p>

 Gogeta*</b><o:p>
 </o:p>
 &nbsp; The first attempt of Goku and Vegeta to fuse fails, as Vegeta uses his
 fists instead of pointing his fingers at the end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>This incident is really Goku’s fault, because when he teaches Vegeta
 the fusion dance, he tells him to concentrate on the position of his legs and
 feet, and forgets to tell Vegeta to point his fingers).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The result of the fusion dance when performed incorrectly is
 actually quite hilarious, though tragic for the two who fused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>He calls himself Gogeta, but his personality is different when the
 fusion is performed correctly.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He looks kind of like Gogeta, except that he is grossly
 obese, and his only sort of “techniques” are farting and running away (o.O;).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Goku and Vegeta are only stuck in this form for half an hour, after
 which Fat Gogeta defuses back into the two Saiyajin.<o:p>

 - “Son Gohan”<o:p>

 </b></span>&nbsp; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Goku and Chi Chi’s
 first son, named after Goku’s adoptive grandfather Gohan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>The name Gohan means rice, which is of course one of Goku’s favorite
 things (food).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Gohan was born in
 the year 757 AD, and at the start of DBZ, he is 4 years old (contrary to the
 dub version, which says he is 5).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Gohan
 is raised mainly by his mother during the first four years of his life, and she
 tutors him in hopes that he would be a great scholar one day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>In early DBZ, Gohan is put through events that would traumatize any
 little kid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In one day, he’s
 kidnapped by his uncle Radditz, and watches as a furious battle ensues between
 Goku, Piccolo and Radditz.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
 things look grim for Goku as Radditz proves his superiority in power, Gohan’s
 anger explodes and he manages to seriously injure Radditz, which neither Goku
 nor Piccolo had been able to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
 Goku’s death, Piccolo leaves Gohan in the wilderness to survive on his own
 for six months to become stronger so that he can stand up to the approaching
 Saiyajin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Gohan is forced to grow
 up quickly, and by the age of 5 he’s battling to save the Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>He becomes attached to Piccolo, his teacher, and idolizes him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Gohan is different from all other characters in the first half of DBZ,
 because he is the only half-human, half-Saiyajin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>When his Saiyajin power becomes mixed with his human emotions, he is
 able to summon an unbelievable amount of power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>This power is released when Gohan becomes extremely angry, and he calls
 upon his Saiyajin rage when battling Radditz, Nappa, Vegeta, the Ginyu Force,
 Frieza, and Cell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Gohan is the
 first Saiyajin to achieve Super Saiyajin 2, which he reaches because he is
 provoked by Cell repeatedly in order to tap into his power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Finally, when Cell destroys Android 16 and steps on his head, the act
 becomes a trigger that releases Gohan’s immense Saiyajin rage and he goes
 Super Saiyajin 2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With a broken
 arm, Gohan kills Cell using a one-handed Kamehameha.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>In the early Buu Saga (Saiyaman Saga), Gohan becomes the main character
 and the story revolves around him as he goes through high school, and later
 fights crime and becomes a sort of superhero complete with costume and mask,
 known as The Great Saiyaman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Gohan
 is the only Saiyajin to become Mystic, which is a special ability granted by
 Revered Kaioshin that allows Gohan access to his highest power level without
 having to go Super Saiyajin at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Gohan
 meets Videl in high school, who suspects that something is fishy about the
 Great Saiyaman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They become good
 friends after she catches him in costume without the mask, and he teaches her
 how to fly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They fall in love, and
 at the end of DBZ, they have a daughter named Pan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Akira Toriyama originally wanted Gohan to become the main character, of
 the series, but the fans wanted Goku back, so Toriyama drifted away from Gohan
 to focus more on his father again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
 the Buu Saga, Gohan gives up fighting and finally achieves his mother’s dream
 for him to become a scholar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Throughout
 GT, he fights from time to time, but he generally remains a glasses-wearing
 nerd.<o:p>

 Z, Goku is 48 years old.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As an
 adult he is 5’7” and weighs 137 lbs., and his home address on Mount Paozu
 is 439 East District.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Goku Junior - “Son Gokou Jyuniya”<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </b>&nbsp; The great great grandson of Goku.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>In the GT movie, he resides with his grandmother Pan who tells him
 stories of the legend of Goku, but to Goku Jr., they are nothing but stories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Goku Jr. is klutzy and a bit of a wuss.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>He is constantly tormented at school, especially by the bully Pakku.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Goku Jr. looks almost exactly like Goku, but he doesn't have nearly the
 strength of his Saiyajin ancestor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
 like Goku, he has a heart of gold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
 goes on a journey to Paozu Mountain, where is great-great-grandfather Goku was
 raised and later made a home (and strangely enough, the same place Goku
 crash-landed on Earth when he was an infant).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Thus, this mountain has special meaning to Goku and his family,
 including his descendants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Goku
 Jr. travels to Paozu Mountain along with the school bully Pakku who later
 befriends him, to track down the dragonballs so that he can wish his sick
 grandmother Pan to be well again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
 GT movie appears to totally disregard the final scene in the last episode of GT,
 where Pan, as an old grandmother, watches her grandson Goku Jr. fight in a
 World Tournament against Vegeta Jr. (whose direct ancestors are never
 specified, although he is a descendant of Vegeta).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Contrary to the movie, both of the boys appear to be fantastic fighters,
 and they both turn Super Saiyajin as they fight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>They look about 5-7 years old, which is the youngest age known for any
 character to turn Super Saiyajin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
 two represent the spirits of the greatest warriors of all, Goku and Vegeta, who
 continue to live on in their ancestors and in the hearts of the viewers (^_^).<o:p>

 </o:p>
 &nbsp; A member of Bojack’s team in Movie 9, he uses a combination of
 weapons, wielding both a sword and a machine gun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>He is killed by his own leader Bojack.<o:p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><b>Goten
 - “Son Goten”</b><o:p>
 </o:p>
 &nbsp; The second child of Goku and Chi Chi, Goten is born in 767 AD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Goten resembles his father very much, and their facial features are
 almost identical.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By the time
 Goten is born, his father has already died in the Cell Saga, and so Goten never
 gets to know his father until about the age of 7 or 8 when Goku returns to
 Earth for a day, which is the day that the two first meet in a brief but
 touching scene.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Goten turns Super
 Saiyajin at a much younger age than his brother Gohan or his father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Goten is famous for his mispronunciation of his father’s move, as “KameHAmeHA!”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Aside from that, Goten has only one other attack which he calls “Totsugeki”,
 which translates literally to “Attack!”.<o:p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><b>Gotenks</b><o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span>&nbsp; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">One
 of the most powerful characters in all of DBZ, Gotenks is the fusion result of
 Trunks and Goten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Goku and Piccolo
 teach Goten and Trunks the fusion dance, a technique taught by Kami used to
 become a warrior many times more powerful than either Trunks or Goten alone.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Gotenks is a completely different person, and so his
 personality is totally different than either boy who fused to create him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Gotenks’ power is fantastic, and he is one of only two characters that
 have ever achieved Super Saiyajin 3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
 fights Majin Buu twice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first
 time is after the boys figure out how to fuse correctly, but Gotenks loses the
 battle pitifully.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This fight is
 shown in the anime only.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
 second time they face off is the famous battle which begins in the Room of
 Spirit and Time, then expands to Kami’s Palace (which is completely
 demolished) and finally ends on Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Gotenks
 makes up the names of his attacks as he fights, such as “Miracle Super
 Punch”, and “Great Kick Special”, and “Galactic Donut”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>While some of his attacks seem a waste of time, others appear more
 successful, such as the Kamikaze Ghost attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>When Gotenks reaches Super Saiyajin 3, he can easily defeat Buu, and he
 knows it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But instead of taking
 him out, Gotenks’ cockiness gets the better of him and he toys with Buu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
 </span>Unfortunately, he defuses after the set half-hour time limit before he
 can destroy Buu.</span></font>
