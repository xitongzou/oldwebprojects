  - Best Of Strongest Vs. Strongest</font></h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">This film starts off with Gohan studying
  hard as ever, attempting to finish so that he can go out with his dad &#150; Goku. Chi-Chi
  watches over her son in an over-protective way. Oolong and Krillen enter, just as Gohan
  finishes his homework. Everyone is carrying backpacks, and Goku reveals that they are
  about to go camping.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Kula, the brother of Frieza, speaks of his
  siblings defeat by a Super Saiyan. He vows for vengeance, and goes off with his followers
  to Earth.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">The gang are gathering firewood at the
  camping location, before Gohan and Krillen are attacked from behind, leaving Oolong
  cowering in fear. The attackers reveal themselves to be Kula&#146;s henchmen, consisting
  of three highly skilled warriors. One of them messes around with Gohan, swinging him round
  by his tail, agitating him greatly. Goku sees what is happening, and runs over, demanding
  that his son be released. The henchmen turn to the Saiyan, and attack him intently, but
  are unable to lay a hand on him. He toys around with them until their boss arrives, and
  scares them all into backing off. Goku turns to see Kula, and at first mistakes him for
  Frieza. The evil being sees Goku, and knows at once that he is a Super Saiyan, even though
  he is in his normal form. Gohan picks up Krillen, and flies towards his dad. Kula sees
  this, and targets them with his eye lasers, but Goku nobly dives in the way, and takes the
  blast for his son, causing him to drop into a flowing river, with his son and Krillen held
  tightly in his arms. They are washed along for a while, before Goku is pulled out of the
  water, and taken to shelter by his friend and son. Kula knows Goku isn&#146;t finished,
  and orders his warriors to find and destroy the injured warriors.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Gohan sets off in search of Karin the cat,
  and sensu beans, leaving Krillen to car for Goku. It takes Gohan a short while, but
  eventually he arrives, and Karin reluctantly hands the beans over, followed by Yajirobe
  giving him one for good luck, which he tucks into his belt gratefully.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Gohan turns back, but is found by the
  henchmen, who try and bully him into giving them the bag of sensu beans. Once again
  though, as is so often in these DBZ films, Piccolo saves him. Gohan flies off towards his
  dad, whilst Piccolo fights the warriors, gaining a small advantage, and killing two out of
  the three of them. He fights with the other one, with a distinct overall superiority until
  Kula comes along, and blasts him right out of the sky, defeating him easily, but not
  managing to kill him. Piccolo soars downwards, in agony, and is unable to pull himself out
  of the descent. He too mistakes Kula for Frieza, as he sees his last waking moments,
  before fading into unconsciousness.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">The one remaining henchmen finds Gohan and
  Krillen, and attacks them, but not before Gohan manages to give Goku a sensu bean. After a
  short amount of time, Goku walks out of the cave. Kula arrives at this point, with Piccolo
  held in his hand. Goku confronts him, and Kula drops the Namek down to the Saiyan. Goku
  holds out his arms to catch Piccolo, but before he can, Kula blasts the Namek, knocking
  him down faster, a flaming wreck. Goku is incredibly angry, and charges at Kula. They
  battle for a short while, with Goku eventually managing to force Kula to back off, and
  transform into his most powerful state.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Kula easily defeats Goku in this form, even
  after he had used his most powerful attack &#150; The KameHameHa, with Kula easily gliding
  right through it, and slamming the Saiyan to the ground with his superior speed and
  strength. Goku has had enough of Kula, and remembers all that he has done to his friends,
  and his rage bursts out, allowing him to turn Super Saiyan. He is far more powerful in
  this form, and defeats Kula with very little effort, having a huge advantage up to the
  point where Kula is seemingly too hurt to continue. Suddenly, he shoots a sneak attack
  right at the Super Saiyan, with Goku not even bothering to block it, as he is too strong
  for it to hurt him. A cloud of smoke goes up, and this is all Kula needs. He gathers the
  energy for a huge death ball, and when Goku sees it, it is too late to stop the attack
  from being launched right at him. Goku catches it, but it drives him down to the ground.
  He struggles against it for a while, before pulling out all his power, and reversing the
  attack with a KameHameHa wave, hitting it right back at Kula, and driving him right out of
  the Earths atmosphere, directly into the sun, with the intensive power of his beam. The
  threat has been vanquished, and the Earth is safe once more thanks to Son Goku &#150;
  Super Saiyan.</font></small>
