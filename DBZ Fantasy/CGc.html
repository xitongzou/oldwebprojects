 Chicken - “Kyaputen Chikin”<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </font></span>&nbsp;</b> <font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">One
 of the many goofy (though muscle-bound) competitors in the 28<sup>th</sup>
 Tenkaichi Budoukai.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Basically he’s a man in a chicken suit. o.o;;<o:p>

 - “Gashyu”*</b><o:p>

 of Garlic Junior’s minions in the anime.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He is powerful, and one of the last characters to die in the Saga.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Like Garlic Jr., he receives a big dose of power when the Makyo-sei, or
 Devil Star Planet (Makyo Star) nears Earth.<o:p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Caterpi
 - “Kiyatapi”<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </b></font></span>&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A
 competitor in the Annoyoichi Budoukai who faces off with Goku.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>As Goku’s first opponent, he underestimates Goku’s power and
 attempts to tickle Goku into submission with his many hands, but it doesn’t
 quite work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>Without
 warning, in the middle of the match he goes into a pupa state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>As South Kai tells Goku and the crowd, Caterpi would later hatch out as
 a much more powerful adversary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The only problem is, the incubation period in the cocoon lasts for 1,200
 years!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
 without much argument, the match is forfeited to Goku. (Is it just me, or does
 this guy have the same name as a Pokemon…? <span lang="ES" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: ES">O.o;;)<o:p>

 female member of Bardock’s team.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>She is cool and casual, and seems to have known Bardock for longer than
 the others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>In
 the Bardock Special, she teases Bardock about his habits and asks him more
 personal questions than the other members, such as why doesn’t he visit his
 newborn son.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>Celipa
 is killed by Frieza’s henchmen, who were sent specifically to assassinate
 Bardock and his team.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Cell
 - “Seru”<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </b></font></span>&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The
 greatest biological warrior ever created.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Dr. Gero originally brought forth the general concept of Cell, although
 it is not Dr. Gero who directly creates Cell, but rather his computer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Over a period of about a year, Dr. Gero collected blood samples from the
 greatest fighters who had ever walked the Earth, including Goku, Vegeta,
 Piccolo, Nappa, Frieza, and King Cold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Gero accomplishes this feat by using a tiny robot drone disguised to
 look like a typical bee to collect each blood sample.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Gero then combined the DNA of all these fighters to create the ultimate
 biological weapon, which began as a small life form in its larva stage sealed
 within Gero’s secret laboratory, and would continue to grow in a tank
 monitored by the computer until it reached its hatching stage, a process which
 takes about 24 years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>However, when Cell first emerges as “complete,” he is far from the
 biological weapon Gero had dreamed Cell would become.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>His first form as Imperfect Cell resembles that of a giant cockroach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>In order for Cell to become “perfect,” he must absorb two components
 built by Dr. Gero, which are Androids 17 and 18.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Cell is actually from the future, as the time of his hatching is several
 years too late to absorb the Androids, who were killed by Trunks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Cell solves this problem by killing Trunks and stealing his time
 machine, then traveling back in time to 4 years before the appearance of the
 Androids, during which time he absorbs nutrients underground until he can
 emerge once again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He searches long and hard for the two Androids, absorbing entire towns
 full of people along his way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Vegeta, Piccolo and the crew are hardly a match for him as he grows
 stronger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>He
 finally succeeds in absorbing both androids, and as Perfect Cell, his power is
 just short of invincible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>To prove his superiority to every single fighter on the planet, he
 organizes the Cell Game, his own World Tournament, which turns out to be more
 like a battle to save the planet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Cell proves that he is stronger than even Goku, and later manages to
 kill both him and Trunks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>An enraged Gohan then takes on Cell, who continues to pick at the
 boy’s anger by releasing his asexually-produced children called Cell Juniors
 upon the rest of the fighters there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>When Cell destroys Android 16 and crushes his head with his foot, the
 act ultimately causes Gohan to reach SSJ2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Gohan finally destroys Cell once and for all with a huge, one-handed
 Kamehameha (due to his broken arm), with the help of Vegeta who distracts Cell
 by firing a Final Flash at the monster from behind just as Gohan adds more
 energy to his blast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Because Cell’s body completely disintegrates in the blast, he cannot
 regenerate himself and so is truly dead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Cell dies on May 26<sup>th</sup>, 767 AD.<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </span></font></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Cell
 Junior</b><o:p>
 </o:p>
 </font></span>&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Another
 trait Cell has acquired through his Namekian genes (or at least, its assumed
 that’s where he got this) is the ability to asexually reproduce.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He produces 7 small versions of himself, called Cell Juniors, from a
 tube in his back (once the end of his tail).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The Cell Juniors are feisty midgets who resemble Seibamen, except much
 more powerful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>They wield a good fraction of Cell’s strength, and seem to match the
 strength of every fighter they face, even that of a Super Saiyajin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Cell creates 7 Cell Juniors in order to have one for each of the
 warriors present, and he commands them to severely beat each fighter in
 attempts to raise Gohan’s anger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>All of the Cell Juniors are violently killed by Gohan when he reaches
 Super Saiyajin 2.<o:p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Chaozu
 - “Chiaotsu”<o:p>
 </o:p>
 </b></font></span>&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Chaozu
 is Tien’s midget telepathic friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Tien and Chaozu’s pasts are never completely revealed, but Tien makes
 it clear that he will protect Chaozu no matter what.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Chaozu is apparently human, with a few different traits than most
 characters in the series.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He looks more like a doll than a human, and never seems to grow or age
 physically.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>He
 weighs 73 lbs and stands 4’5” tall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Chaozu can fight well, although most of his special abilities center on
 telepathy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>He
 can halt a person’s movement if he is able to hold his concentration, and he
 can speak to Tien telepathically.<o:p>

 Chi</b><o:p>
 </o:p>
 </font></span>&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The
 wife of Goku and mother of Gohan and Goten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>She is the daughter of Gyuu Maou, or Ox-King, who promises her hand in
 marriage to Goku when they are only little kids.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Chi Chi later meets Goku again at the 23<sup>rd</sup> Tenkaichi Budoukai,
 where the two must face off in a match.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>She loses to Goku, but reminds him when the match is over who she is,
 and asks if he wants to marry her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The naïve Goku answers with a simple “Sure,” although he doesn’t
 know what marriage is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Chi Chi is set on making her son Gohan a scholar, and so she is very
 hard on his academic life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Although it is more over-pronounced in the anime than in the manga, Chi
 Chi often goes ballistic over her son’s less-than-perfect study habits, and
 Goku’s influence upon them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Though it may not always be particularly noticeable, she really loves
 her husband dearly, and in the anime there are some sweet scenes between the
 two.<o:p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Cooler
 - “Kuura” (read as Koola)*</b><o:p>
 </o:p>
 </font></span>&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Brother
 of Frieza, son of King Cold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>One common alternate spelling of his name is Koola.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Cooler appears only in DBZ Movies 5 and 6.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Like his brother, Cooler has the ability to transform in order to
 increase his power level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>However, he is in his 4<sup>th</sup> form when he first appears in Movie
 5, and later he evolves into a menacing 5<sup>th</sup> form.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He cares nothing about his brother, and goes to Earth only because he
 finds it interesting that a single Saiyajin could defeat him, rather than to
 seek revenge for his brother’s death (despite the dubbed movie title
 “Cooler’s Revenge”).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>In Movie 5, Goku defeats Cooler by blasting him and his Death Ball into
 the sun with a Kamehameha, supposedly incinerating him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>However, Cooler returns in Movie 6 as a cyborg.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>A planet-devouring mass of intelligent machinery, called the Big Ghetti
 Star saved Cooler’s brain, recognizing Cooler as a powerful fighter and a
 valuable tool to gaining power and data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Cooler’s disfigured head remains at the core of the ship, as it was
 the only part of Cooler that survived being shot into the sun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Eventually Cooler learned to control the Ghetti Star to a point with his
 mind, and he travels about from planet to planet, robbing each of its energy to
 feed the Ghetti Star.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He attempts to take over a nearby planet, which happens to be Namek II,
 or New Namek, the planet that the Namekians migrate to after the destruction of
 their first planet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Cooler enslaves the people of Namek and forces them to work and bring
 valuable energy to the Ghetti Star, which is his power source.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Goku, Vegeta and a few of the Z Senshi arrive not a moment too soon,
 only to discover that Cooler is far more powerful than he had been the first
 time Goku faces him, because of his new cyborg form.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Cooler has great advantages over the Super Saiyajin because of the fact
 that he can create hundreds or even thousands of clones of himself using the
 Ghetti Star’s power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Cooler easily captures Goku and Vegeta, and contains them in a holding
 room, where they are held by special wires attached to all parts of their
 bodies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>These
 wires drain their Super Saiyajin energy to feed the Ghetti Star whenever Cooler
 so chooses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>What
 Cooler did not guess was that the sheer immensity of the Saiyajins’ willpower
 could give them incredible energy even when all hope was lost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The two Super Saiyajin literally defy logic, and manage to raise so much
 energy that they overload the entire system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>In a final all-out battle, Cooler attempts to finish Goku and Vegeta
 before he loses his power source, but it is only in vain, as the Ghetti Star is
 ultimately destroyed, along with the last remains of Cooler.<o:p>
