<a href="serious1.html">Next Page &gt &gt</a><p><br>
<p>1. You grow your hair, die it blonde, and increase your muscle 
              mass, then start claiming that you are the legendary super saiyan.<br>
              <br>
              2. You run at your head teacher shouting 'Die Frieza!', and get 
              suspending for beating him to a pulp. <br>
              <br>
              3. You wolf down your dinner as fast as you can, spitting it everywhere, 
              then calling the canteen lady King Kai/Bulma/Chi-Chi, and asking 
              for more. <br>
              <br>
              4. You tie a yo-yo to your wrist, then pretend to blast someone 
              with it, instead hitting them on the head and rendering them unconscious. 
              <br>
              <br>
              5. You come to school with a sword, and attack any bullies that 
              you see with it, and you call your best friend Goten.<br>
              <br>
              6. You sit on the toilet when you have constipation, pretending 
              to power up like Goku would, letting out cries as you do so. <br>
              <br>
              7. You make a scouter out of a bit of cardboard, and pretend to 
              take everyone's power levels with it, sweating as you (pretend to) 
              take one which is even higher than yours.<br>
              <br>
              8. You start throwing your moms best china plates at people, yelling 
              'Destructo disc!' at the top of your voice. <br>
              <br>
              9. You jump off the top of your house, and yell 'Nimbus' as you 
              fall head first, expecting a floating cloud to come pick you up.<br> 
              <br>
              10. You have a terrible hatred towards robots, as you get out your 
              trusty sword, and chop them in half whenever you see them, vowing 
              to gain vengeance on them for what they did to everybody. <br>
              <br>
              11.You pretend that your 'lights out' game is a dragon radar, and 
              you walk around the world, getting to where you consider the lights 
              to be, and searching for dragonballs around there. <br>
              <br>
              12.You stand inside a circle of raging fire, then start yelling, 
              claiming that the fire is an aura of pure energy from your strength....until 
              you run out, rolling around the floor as you try to put the fire, 
              that has spread upon you, out.<br>
              <br>
              13. You start talking in Japanese, and begin to swear, calling everyone 
              bastards, then chopping them in half with blood flying everywhere. 
              You then turn back to American/English, and start to politely shake 
              hands, and secretly cut everyone in half, without anyone seeing. 
              <br>
              <br>
              14. You try to escape from a tight situation by putting your hands 
              to your eyes, shouting 'Solar flare', then flashing an incredibly 
              bright torch in their face. <br>
              <br>
              15. You pick up a CD, wrap it in a towel, then throw it at someone, 
              bringing it back if they dodge it, for another attack, yelling 'Die 
              super saiyan! You can never beat the great Frieza!&quot; <br>
              <br>
              16. You're scared that all women will shout at you whenever you 
              do anything remotely wrong. <br>
              <br>
              17. You get your friend to play a trick on someone by making it 
              seem as though you are floating, then you dive bomb the people watching, 
              trying to catch them off guard to attack. <br>
              <br>
              18. You and a friend do the fusion dance in front of a bully, telling 
              him that you will both fuse into one and becoming far stronger than 
              even him, expecting the bully to be intimidated. <br>
              <br>
              19. You host a Tenkachi Budoki in your back garden, and grow a mini-afro 
              on your head, then bribe all of your mates to lose against you purposely, 
              claiming to be the world champion, and the strongest man in the 
              world when you win.<br>
              <br>
              20. You cut your arm off, and try and show your friends that you 
              are from the planet Namek, and try to regenerate it, with try being 
              the keyword. <br>
              <br>
              21. Every time you see an explosion you think that it is because 
              of an evil, super powered villain, so you quickly run over to the 
              scene to check it out (Of course, it never is an evil, super powered 
              villain, but a mere gas leak) <br>
              <br>
              22. You train in places with increased gravity....or at least you 
              write the number '50', put it on your bedroom door, and start doing 
              press ups, hoping to get stronger for the fight against Frieza. 
              <br>
              <br>
              23. Whenever you can't blast your friends with a KameHameHa, you 
              secretly pull a lighter out of your pocket, tuck it up your sleeve, 
              then flick it so sparks fly off, seemingly out of your hand, as 
              you claim that you are all out of energy. <br>
              <br>
              24. Whenever you walk into the kitchen, you attack your freezer, 
              just in case it is the evil tyrant in disguise. <br>

              25. You shave your head, draw 6 spots on your forehead, cut off 
              your nose, call your best friend Goku, use the word 'bro' a lot, 
              and make your friends call you 'Krillen the great'.<br>
              <br>
              26. (This ones for the chicks) You are really bitchy towards your 
              son (Or in the event of you not having a son, your little friend) 
              and make him do his homework 24:7, then yell at him for saving the 
              world when he fights off evil monsters. <br>
              <br>
              27. You laugh at your friends, and tell them that you know the secret 
              to instantanious movement. When they throw a brick at your head, 
              you try to disappear (Needless to say that you would fail, and have 
              a severe bump on your head for a while) <br>
              <br>
              28. You make a big, fat, ugly pink plastecine man, call him Dodoria, 
              and pretend to be Vegeta as you pull his fake arms backwards and 
              taunt him (Even though he can't speak back, and you quite often 
              rip his arms right off, must be the strength of a saiyan eh?) <br>
              <br>
              29. You talk in a sissy English accent to all your friends, and 
              put your hair in a poofy braid, then use facepaints to paint your 
              skin a light green, you die your hair green, then you get mad, and 
              'transform' into a monster (You tense all your muscles up, but pretend 
              that you are a whole different being now) <br>
              <br>
              30. You carry a light bulb in your hand at all times, and insist 
              that it is your intense KI, making your friends believe you.....until 
              you drop the light bulb and break it due to the massive heat that 
              is burning your hands. <br>
              <br>
            <p>37. You dress up as a DBZ Character for Halloween and keep whering 
              intel your mom says I won't let you watch your TV show enless you 
              let me wash that outfit.</p><p>
