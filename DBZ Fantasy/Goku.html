He's married to Chi-chi and he has sons named Gohan and Goten. He is the only one to reach all of the super saiyen stages. He was originally sent to Earth to destroy it, but an accident has left him to become good. After Cell self-destructed, he has trained in the “other world”, during the Buu saga though, the supreme kai has offered to switch places with him so he can live on Earth again. Goku is the first to go super saiyan 1,3&4. He goes super saiyan when Freeza destroys Krillen(his life long best friend), he reaches super saiyan 2&3 while training in the “other world”, and goes super saiyan 4 while fighting Bebi-Vegeta. He has faced Vegeta several times, when Vegeta first comes to Earth, and when Vegeta is controlled by Babi-di. Without Goku, Freeza, the Ginyu force, and Majin buu would still be in power. He also learns the fusion technique while in the “other world”.  He teaches Gohan, Goten, babytrunks, and Vegeta how to fuse. He is also the most powerful non-fusion character in DBZ.<br>Attacks: kamehameha, ultimate kamehameha, fusion, dragon fist, spirit bomb, kao-ken, solar flare, super ki blast.<br> Power level at beginning of DBZ: 360<br>Power level at end of DBZ: 550,000,000<br>Brother: Raditz, Father: Bardock, Wife: Chi-chi, Sons: Gohan, Goten.<br>Class: Saiyan<br></p></body></html>
