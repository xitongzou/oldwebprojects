<b>What if Vegeta had killed #19 and #20 before #20 could awaken #17 and #18? By:<a href="mailto:legendary_ssj2k@angelfire.com">Majin Gotenks</a></b>
<br>    
After defeating the androids, Vegeta would then become bent upon Goku healing so that the two of them could duel and would fly to Goku's house to make sure he heals. Trunks will arrive again from the future, but seeing no androids and being informed by the Z warriors that the androids were defeated (they don't know about #17 and #18) he will return to the future. When Cell arrives he will hunt about for #17 and #18 and Kami will sense him running amok, as will the Z warrior eventually. Since Piccolo does not realize the full power of Cell yet, he will not fuse with Kami. The Z warriors go to battle Cell. During their battle with Cell, the Z senshi would eventually discover his purpose and inform him triumphantly that the two androids were killed. Cell would be too shocked to battle and would fly off to Gero's lab to see if he could find the androids. Vegeta would think that Cell was ignoring him and fly after him, followed closely by the Z fighters. At the lab, Cell would discover #17 and #18 and activate theut #16 would step in and destroy him utterly and completely, then go after Goku. By this time, Goku would have probably healed and would be up and about, knowing nothing of the androids or Cell. #16 would soon arrive and face off against him and destroy him. #16 would then become a peace-loving android. Mr. Popo would teleport to New Namek and ask to use their Dragonballs. They will let him and he will wish for everyone killed by any creation of Dr. Gero to be revived and all the people killed will be revived. There won't be that much difference in the Buu Saga, except for no Marron, and Piccolo being weaker against Buu, having not fused with Kami. The Bebi Saga will be the same as always, but there would be no Super #17 saga, #17 having been killed while inside of Cell. This would also cause them not to have to use the Dragonballs again, but if they ever were to, the Evil-Shenlong saga would then take place.

<b>What if the Z-Fighters had Gokou's Heart Medicine on hand when they began 
their battle with Androids No. 19 and 20?</b>-Submitted by <a href="mailto:MajinVader@aol.com">Majin Vader</a><br>
If Gokou had the heart medicine on hand during the battle with Android No. 
19, he would not have had to leave the battlefield, and could keep on 
fighting.  His Saiyajin physiology would probably allow him to get stronger 
because of being healed from the terrible disease (he might possibly need a 
Senzu Bean as well, however).  After being fully healed Gokou would then be 
able to destroy Android No. 19 as well as Android No. 20.
Eventually, Vegeta would arrive, and wonder what the hell had happened.  The 
Z Fighters would explain that Gokou had defeated the Androids all by himself. 
 Vegeta would then go Super Saiyajin, and decide that now he would be able to 
get his rematch.  The two Super Saiyajin would be very evenly matched, and 
begin their duel (in the manga, it says that Vegeta was stronger than Gokou, 
but after being healed with a Senzu Bean, Gokou would probably be about equal 
to Vegeta).Suddenly, Trunks would return from the future, and try to stop Gokou 
and Vegeta's fight, and explain that they had destroyed the wrong Androids.  
The Z Fighters would then work on trying to find these Androids, but would have 
no luck in doing so.
Eventually, the Z Fighters would find out about the sighting of the second 
Time Machine.  Gokou, Gohan, Trunks, and Bulma would probably go check it 
out, and find the egg shells of Cell.  Meanwhile, they would find out about 
some sort of monster attacking the cities and killing the people.  Vegeta 
would be the first to go, still itching for a fight, and would be easily 
defeated by the incredibly strong Cell.  Piccolo would realize that there was 
no way any of them could ever defeat the Monster, unless he were to fuse with 
Kami, and so he would head off to Kami's Lookout.  Kami, sensing that this 
Cell was way too strong, he'd realize that he'd have to fuse with Piccolo.
Gokou would go and try to save the battered Vegeta, and they would realize 
that there was currently nothing that they could do to stop Cell, until the 
New Piccolo: Super Namek-Seijin, would return and fight.  Eventually, Piccolo 
would return from the fusion, and do battle against Cell.  Piccolo would 
probably still pretend to let himself get absorbed so that Cell would talk.  
Cell would probably blab about absorbing Androids No. 17 and 18.  Piccolo, 
having the info needed, would start to dominate Cell again in battle.  Cell 
would be too weak to beat Piccolo, and would use a Taiyoken to escape and try 
to absorb more people.  With his incredible ability to hide his ki, Cell 
would evade the Z Fighters repeatedly, and with his incredible quickness, he 
would go from city to city without anyone ever stopping him.
Gokou would heal Vegeta, and Vegeta would become determined to get strong 
enough to beat Cell.  Gokou would tell him about the Room of Spirit and Time, 
and would let Vegeta and Trunks enter the Room.  Piccolo would eventually 
meet up with Gokou again, and explain Cell's plans to absorb No. 17 and No. 
18.  Hopefully, this would lead them to the Androids' locations.
Meanwhile, Cell would go to Dr. Gero's Laboratory, and awaken Androids No. 17 
and 18.  Cell, thinking that now he would be able to absorb the Androids, 
become Perfect, and have nothing to fear, would no longer hide his ki.  
Gokou, with his unique sensing abilities, would realize that Cell had stopped 
moving for some reason, and teleport to that location, to find Cell attacking 
the Androids.  Gokou would then teleport No. 17 and 18 away from Cell, 
probably to Kami's Lookout.  Angered, Cell would continue to ravage the 
towns, absorbing more and more people.
After rescuing the Androids, the two of them would probably wonder what the 
hell was going on.  Gokou would explain everything about the arrival of 
Android No. 19 and 20, and his defeating them.  Thankful that Gokou had 
defeated Dr. Gero, the Androids would not go through with trying to kill him. 
 Gokou would then explain the situation with Cell.  The Androids would then 
remember seeing Android No. 16 in a large capsule back at the lab, and that 
it would probably be helpful.  The Androids would take Gokou back to the lab, 
and they would awaken Android No. 16, and ask them to help fight Cell.  
Android No. 16, being the pacifist that he is, would refuse to fight Cell 
without more information about him, and how he was so evil.
Now, Vegeta and Trunks would leave the Room of Spirit and Time, with each of 
them having reached Ultra Super Saiyajin (USSJ).  (In the regular timeline, 
the two of them would have gone directly to fight Cell, but at that time, 
Cell was Second Form Cell, and in the middle of trying to absorb No. 18.  
However, in this timeline, thanks to Gokou's efforts, he would still be in 
his First Form, and traveling from town to town absorbing normal people.)  
In the regular timeline, Gokou and Gohan would have been the next to enter 
the Room of Spirit and Time, but here, Gokou would realize that if he left 
Vegeta, Trunks, and the Androids alone together, all hell would break loose.  
Gokou would decide to send Android No. 18 in with Gohan, so that Gohan would 
get stronger, and become the strongest Super Saiyajin.  Gokou would probably 
realize that USSJ would leave someone a bit too slow to fight, and would 
think that Gohan would have what it took to truly excel beyond Super Saiyajin.
Eventually, Cell would absorb so many people, that his ki wouldn't be so easy 
to hide anymore.  Piccolo, after training by himself, would sense this, and 
so, try to attack Cell again.  This time, however, Cell would be too strong 
for Piccolo, and things would not look good for the Super Namek-Seijin.
Now, No. 18 and Gohan would leave the Room of Spirit and Time, and Gohan 
would be a Super Saiyajin.  Sensing that Piccolo was in trouble, he would 
head off to help fight Cell.  Gokou would not stop him, because he would know 
that Gohan would have what it takes, and sense that Gohan was no ordinary 
Super Saiyajin.  Gokou would then enter the Room of Spirit and Time with 
Android No. 17, but not before telling No. 18 to stay away from Cell for the 
moment.  Trunks would then head off to fight Cell, but Vegeta would stop him 
and say that he wanted to wait until Cell became a real challenge.
Gohan would arrive on the scene and help Piccolo take down Cell.  The two of 
them would probably defeat Cell, and Cell would ask how Gohan had become so 
strong in such a short amount of time.  Gohan, feeling overconfident, would 
explain the Room of Spirit and Time to Cell, who would then escape and fly 
towards the Room of Spirit and Time.  Piccolo and Gohan would then try to fly 
after him.<BR>
Cell would arrive at the Room of Spirit and Time, and set his sights on 
Android No. 18, and begin to try and absorb her.  Then, Trunks would go USSJ 
and start to beat the crap out of Cell.  Cell would then escape again, but 
instead of flying to a city to try and absorb people, Cell would think about 
his current location, and fly down to Karin Tower and steal some Senzu Beans 
to cure himself, rather than just regenerating.  With his Saiyajin DNA, Cell 
might even become stronger, and then would regenerate!  (I would imagine that 
when Cell regenerates itself, it probably doesn't become stronger because 
that regeneration comes from Namek-Seijin DNA.  However, if it regenerates 
from an outside source like Senzu, the Saiyajin cells would be in effect in 
this case.)  A now stronger Cell would then continue to fight Trunks, and 
last longer with his constant, repeated replenishment using Senzu Beans, 
getting stronger and stronger.  Vegeta would not bother to step in because he 
would want to wait until Cell was as strong as possible.  And USSJ Trunks 
would not let loose his full power on Cell because it would destroy Earth.  
Furthermore, Cell would be fighting with everything he had, and USSJ Trunks 
would be distracted by constantly having to stop Cell from destroying their 
battlefield.<BR>
Finally, Gokou and Android No. 17 would leave the Room of Spirit and Time.  
Gokou would teleport the Androids to Kame House, and then return to face 
Cell.  Gokou would offer to go one on one with Cell, and, being better at 
keeping his ki under control than Trunks, would use regular SSJ to fight Cell.
Gokou would have Cell on the ropes, and Cell would realize that there was no 
where to run.  Gokou had told Trunks and Vegeta to make sure Cell didn't 
escape.  Cell would realize that Gokou wasn't using his full power, and 
remember Gokou's naivete that was in his own cells.  Cell would play the 
sympathy card, and try to beg Gokou for forgiveness.  Gokou would make Cell 
promise to never again absorb anyone.
Vegeta, enraged by Gokou's seemingly infinite generosity, would attack Gokou 
and Cell as a USSJ, letting loose all his power, hardly thinking about 
preserving Earth.  Between keeping Cell from getting killed, and keeping 
Earth safe, Gokou, Trunks, and Cell would have their hands full.
To try to keep Cell from getting killed, Gokou would ask Android No. 16 to 
escort Cell away from there, but not to take him to Kame House, as it was 
uncertain if he could be trusted or not.  Cell might then try to absorb No. 
16 and fail, and No. 16 would realize Cell's true intentions, and begin to 
beat the crap out of him.  Eventually, Vegeta, Gokou, and Trunks would 
arrive, and Gokou would see that Cell really is evil.   Enraged, Gokou would 
tell 16 to stand down while he got vengeance.  Cell would use his remaining 
Senzu Beans to cure himself and regenerate again, and become stronger, but 
not enough to defeat Gokou.  Gokou might even go USSJ to kill Cell out of 
sheer rage (like he did against Freeza), thus ending the Android/Cell Saga, 
without any of the Androids having to get absorbed, Gokou having to die, or 
Gohan having to go SSJ 2.
This is just one possible chain of events that could have occured during the 
Cell Saga, and I'm sure there could have been plenty other things to happen.  
This is just my idea. ^_^

<b>What if Kurilin, Gohan, and Bulma had waited for Gokou to heal before they 
left for Namek?</b>-Submitted by <a href="mailto:MajinVader@aol.com">Majin Vader</a>
<br>Gokou would have gone with them, and after getting past the people of the 
Mirror Spaceship and the Fake Namek, they would arrive on Namek.  Gokou would 
have gone to investigate the power levels of Frieza and etc. with Kurilin and 
Gohan.  If Gohan were to try and save Dende from Dodoria, they would not be 
chased far, because Gokou would step in. (By the way, I would imagine that 
after being healed with a Senzu bean, Gokou's Saiyajin physiology would allow 
him to get a lot stronger).  After being stronger, he would probably able to 
go to Kaiouhken Levels like Kaiouhken x 5 a lot easier, so he would defeat 
Dodoria, and get stronger.  The scouters would probably sense that there is a 
Saiyajin higher than Vegeta's.
Vegeta, who is also on Namek, would probably go to face Gokou, and with his 
sensing ability, which still needs to be refined, he would fight Gokou not 
knowing what he was getting into.  Eventually, Zarbon would go check things 
out, and would probably transform early. Gokou and Vegeta would have to stop 
their fight and team up, and they'd defeat Zarbon.  The two Saiyajin would 
probably end up on good terms long before the arrival of the Ginyu Force, 
which would probably be summoned a lot earlier.  If they're summoned earlier, 
then that's when Frieza has less Dragonballs, like only five.  Gokou, Vegeta, 
Gohan, and Kurilin would split up into two teams to find the last two 
Dragonballs.  (By the way, Dende would probably still be with them).  Dende 
would take them to see Guru, they'd get the Dragonballs, and they'd BOTH get 
their sleeping powers awakened).
Meanwhile, Gokou and Vegeta would get the Dragonballs from the Namek Village 
that Vegeta destroyed in the regular timeline.  With Gokou there, Vegeta 
couldn't kill anyone without having to go up against Gokou.  They'd get the 
Dragonball, thanks to Gokou's true honor, and later meet up with Gohan and 
Kurilin.  (Gokou would probably take the tests that Frieza mentioned) They 
might send Vegeta on a mission to see what Frieza and the others were up to 
so they could make sure he wasn't killing more Nameks.  (the reason they'd 
send Vegeta was they'd say that Vegeta was the only one strong enough to do 
it safely [lies, all lies])  They'd also send Vegeta so that Kurilin and 
Gohan could tell Gokou about getting his hidden powers released from Guru 
without having to let Vegeta know.
While Vegeta was spying on Frieza, he'd probably find out about how the Ginyu 
Force was being summoned, and go warn the others. He'd then suggest that 
Gokou, Gohan, and himself start to spar, so that their Saiyajin make-ups 
would allow them to get stronger.  Gokou would hide most of his power level, 
so that Vegeta wouldn't know about how he had gotten a power-up.  But he 
would keep his power level high enough to challenge Vegeta, so Vegeta would 
get strong enough for the Ginyu Force
When the Ginyu Force arrives, everyone would probably have the same power 
levels as they did in the reegular timeline.  But with Gokou present, the 
Ginyu Force would have to worry about Gokou, too.  First, they'd steal the 
Dragonballs from the Z Fighters, and Ginyu would take them back to Frieza.  
Sensing Gokou's possible true power, Ginyu tells Guldo to use his special 
abilities to hold Gokou and Vegeta in place so that they couldn't help 
Kurilin and Gohan.  When Guldo uses the Body Freeze on Gohan and Kurilin, 
however, Gokou gets p.o.'ed and lets loose his full power level, which is too 
high for Guldo to hold him in place.
Now, Guldo would be dead, and Recoome, Burter, and Jeice decide that they all 
have to take out Gokou together.  Gokou would probably be able to take them 
all out.  Vegeta would probably kill off Burter and Recoome, and Jeice might 
run away.  This would probably be the place where DBZ would have the same 
storyline as in the timeline we know.  The What If...? was basically there to 
make everyone realize that you dont have to wait for Gokou to have an 
exciting DBZ Saga!  Gokou can be already there!!!!!

<b>What if Goku had not have hitten his head when being held by Grandpa Gohan
By:<a href="mailto:fannyjack123@hotmail.com">Mark Wilson</a></b>
<br>
<br>
    He would continue to be fierce and destructive, resulting him to find a way to escape from Grandpa Gohan, and finding a place to train, then Raditz would come to make sure his little brother had done his job. They would then team up and train some more, then destroying Earth, later with the help of Vegeta and Nappa, not knowing about the Dragonballs they would have nothing to do but maybe work for Freeza conquering planets. Freeza then getting afraid of the Saiyjins, from getting too strong.  Would either kill them and then that would mean the end of Dragonball or DBZ, and no DB-GT.  If they escaped however, Raditz, Goku, Nappa, and Vegeta would find a good place for training and would learn more techniques.

<b>What if Dr.Gero had known about Goku becoming a Super Saiyan? By:<a href="mailto:fakkeslimshady@hotmail.com">Mason Palamara 
</a></b>
<br>
He would create all the androids much more powerful than they were in the 
series.  Android 19 would be around 18's power so Goku would lose much 
sooner and get absorbed.  Android 20 would hold the Z fighters back probably 
absorb Piccolo.  Vegeta would come and be no match for 19 and he would get 
absorbed to.  Trunks would arrive and realize the androids were to powerful 
so they would retreat to Kami's to train instead of going to Roshi's.  Kami 
would tell them about the Hyperbolic chamber and Trunks and Gohan would go 
in.  Cell would show and track down 20 and 19.  The three of them would go 
to the lab to awaken 17 and 18 so Cell would be perfect.  Trunks and Gohan 
would emerge and be too late to stop Cell from absorbing 17 and 18.  They 
would go back to Kami's after awhile still being to weak.  The androids 
would destroy city after city until Trunks and Gohan would come again.   
Trunks  and Gohan would now be SSJ2.  Trunks would fight Cell first and 
would almost win.  I said almost because 20 would realize it was hopeless 
and talk Cell into letting himself get absorbed.  19 would hold of the 
saiyans as best he could as it would take a long time for 20 to get all of 
Cell's power.  Gohan would kill 19 out of rage as 19 absorbed Goku.  Before 
19 was killed,20 would finish absorbing Cell.  I believe he would then be 
too strong Gohan and Trunks and would rule the Earth.

<br>
While two of them were in training,the other two would train like normal 
outside.  All four would go in twice,so their power levels would be almost 
three times greater than in the series.  Piccolo and Gohan's power would 
stay the same.  The saibamen would get killed and Nappa would get finished 
by Krillin,Tien,or Yamcha because Gohan,Piccolo,and Chaotzu would still be 
too weak.  Everyone would gang up on Vegeta and he would be weakened by the 
time Goku got back.  Vegeta would then change to his ape form and kill the 
same Z warriors that died in the series.  While he was doing that,Goku would 
charge a Spirit Bomb and kill Vegeta.  Krillin,Gohan,Goku,and Bulma would go 
to Namek and Goku would arrive there much weaker since he didn't train in 
the gravity chamber.  The Namek saga would go almost the same and Goku would 
get a power up from the elder with Gohan and Krillin.  Frieza would still 
kill Krillin and Goku would go Super Saiyan.  Frieza would get past Goku 
going back to Earth and wreak havoc and fight the Z warriors until Goku came 
back to Earth and put him out of his misery.  The androids would kill all 
the Z fighters since Vegeta is dead and couldn't father Trunks.

<b>-NEW-What if Gohan didn't have his hidden power?  

By:<a href="mailto:fakkeslimshady@hotmail.com">Mason Palamara

<br>

Radditz would kill Goku,Piccolo,and Gohan since Gohan wouldn't be strong 
enough to weaken Radditz during the fight.  Radditz would train while 
waiting for Vegeta and Nappa to arrive.  Goku,Piccolo,and Gohan would train 
under King Kai.  They would train as hard as they could and Goku and Gohan 
would get much stronger than in the series due to their saiyan biology.   
Piccolo would be around 4000 when they got wished back.  All three would 
know the Kaioken and Spirit Bomb.  All the Z fighters would be dead when 
they got back.  They would kill Radditz and Nappa and triple team Vegeta.   
They would spare Vegeta then go to Namek.  They would train some more on the 
way to Namek because VEgeta was still alive.  Most of the Namek saga would 
go the same except Piccolo would fuse with a healty Nail.   
Dodoria,Zarbon,and the Ginyu Force would die.  The fight with Frieza would 
have a major change.  Frieza would most likely kill Piccolo instead of 
Krillin since Krillin is dead,and Gohan doesn't have his hidden power so he 
would go straight to Super Saiyan along with Goku.  I forgot to put in that 
Vegeta wjould also be on Namek as well,so when he saw a child got SSJ before 
him,he wjould get super p***** and go SSJ as well.  Frieza is now royally 
screwed.  Goku and Gohan would wish back the Z fighters to life and return 
to Earth.  Vegeta would have an inflated ego so he would follow Goku to 
challenge him again.  Garlic Jr wouldn't stand a chance when he arrived.   
Trunks would warn the Z fighters about the androids so they would train.   
The androids and Cell saga would go along the same original way.  While 
training for the Cell games;however,Gohan and Goku would train hard in the 
Hyperbolic time chamber so they would reach SSJ2.  Cell would die then Buu 
would come and go.  The Z fighters would keep training so they would be 
strong enough to have an easy time in DBGT.  They would live happy lives.

<b>What if Kami hadn't fused with Piccolo in the Android Saga? 

By:<a href="mailto:fakkeslimshady@hotmail.com">Mason Palamara

<br>
Piccolo would ignore Kami's warning not to go fight Cell and probably get 
absorbed.  Trunks and Krillin would arrive too late and Cell would get away 
to hunt 17 and 18.  Goku would then get better and take Gohan, Vegeta, and 
Trunks to the Hyperbolic Chamber.  Cell would continue absorbing and Trunks 
and Vegeta would get out to look for him and/or the androids.  Cell would 
eventually track down the androids,but eventually would be a few days so 
Gohan and Goku would emerge and join the hunt.  An interesting showdown 
would take place between the four androids and the four saiyans.  Android 16 
would reconize Goku and attack him.  Vegeta would want revenge against 
Android 18 and attack her.  Gohan would sense Piccolo in Cell and go beserck 
shooting his power up sky-high.  Trunks would then be left with 17 and kill 
him with one blast.  Vegeta would drag his fight out making revenge taste 
sweeter for him but would kill 18.  Despite being a lower power,16 would use 
his knowledge of Goku's attacks to avoid the inevitable.  Trunks would 
distract 16 and Goku would finally deactivate him permanently.  Gohan would 
give Cell a thourough @$$-kicking and blow him up.  It really is weird how 
one little change of events could completely change everything.

They would train hard and emerge as SSJ2.  Vegeta would most likely be the 
one to kill Cell off.  Trunks would return to the future and Vegeta would 
realize he was the strongest fighter in the world now.  He would try once 
again to get immortality.  He would destroy the Capsule Corp. building 
looking for Bulma's DB radar,but Bulma would run off with it and baby 
Trunks.  She would tell Goku and Gohan about Vegeta's rampage.  They would 
fly to the Capsule Corp. and see the destruction causing them to go SSJ2.   
They would catch up with Vegeta and be forced to kill him.  When Buu came 
they would go train and become Mystic Goku and Gohan.  They would come back 
to Earth to fight Buu,but he would absorb Gotenks and force Goku and Gohan 
to fuse,most likely forming an SSJ4 warrior and kill Buu.  The fusion would 
be without the earrings so it would not be permanent.  They would gather the 
dragon balls and wish Goten and Trunks back.  DBGT would go about the

would let Cell find the android. The Cell games would still go on but when it

Goku to go SSJ 2. Goku would show no mercy and kill Cell with a giant

When they found the androids Goku would be killed because of the heart 
disease. This could cause gohan to go SSJ. He would be a little stronger 
thatn Goku and might put up a little fight but would end up losing but not 
get killed. Vegeta would join the fight and would get killed. Trunks would 
come and here the news then go SSJ 2. He would kill the androids then go back 
to the past. Cell would appear and Kami would warn the Z warroirs. He and 
piccolo would fuse then the Z warriors would take on Cell. Gohan would end up 
killing him. Then since no one enter the hyperbolic time chanber no one would

<br>
What if the Z fighters knew about the fusion dance 
during the Saiya-jin Saga?  Not much would be affected 
early on.  No one could fuse in the Raditz fight, 
since you have to be of the same race, height ect to 
fuse.  In the Vegeta/Nappa fight, Yamcha and Tien 
could have fused, and have taken out the Saibamen and 
Nappa, but would still be nothing against Vegeta.  In 
the Namek saga, Vegeta and Goku possibly could have 
fused, and given Frieza a match.  If Gogeta could have 
shown pity for Krillin's death, he could have turned 
SSJ and have destroyed Frieza, like it was nothing. 
In the Cell Games, Trunks/Vegeta/Goku could have fused 
to most likely defeat Cell.  Fusion is learned about 
in the Buu saga anyways, so nothing much would be 
affected.

If Vegetto was not absorbed by Super Buu, he would have killed Buu by using 
Kamehameha or Final Flash. As a result, Vegeta and Goku would be fused as 
Vegetto forever. After defeating Super Buu, Vegetto would collect the 
dragonballs and make a wish for all of the people killed by Buu to be 
brought back to life. The next wish would be used to bring back all of the 
people who were absorbed by Buu. This wish would bring back Piccolo, Goten, 
Trunks, Gohan, and Fat Buu. Vegetto would find Fat Buu and try to kill him. 
Mr. Satan would beg Vegetto to not kill Fat Buu, but Vegetto wouldn't care 
and kill Fat Buu anyway. Since Vegetto believed that he was the most 
powerful being in the universe, he would decide to stay that way forever and 
use the third wish to make himself immortal. Vegetto would not wish for Buu 
to be reincarnated as Ubuu. Vegetto would have to decide whether he wanted 
to live with Chi Chi or with Bulma, and he would decide to live with Bulma 
since her family was rich. <BR><BR>
Over time, Vegetto would train to become even stronger and learn how to 
reach SSJ3. Ten years after Buu was killed, Pilaf would collect the black 
star dragonballs and try to wish to be ruler of the world. Vegetto would 
sense the dragonballs being used and use instantaneous movement to go to 
Kami's Palace and find Pilaf. Vegetto would kill Pilaf, Mao, and Shou. Dende 
and Mr. Popo would tell Vegetto that the Earth would be destroyed if any 
wishes were made with the black star dragonballs, so Vegetto would simply 
destroy the black star dragonballs so the Earth wouldn't explode. 
Bebi would eventually travel to Earth in his mission to destroy the 
Saiya-jins. Vegetto would sense Bebi's ki and find him before he could lay 
eggs in any humans. Vegetto would power up to SSJ2 and easily kill Bebi with 
a Kamehameha. But since Bebi was never able to create the new planet Plant, 
Vegetto would never look at the Earth and become SSJ4. Dr Gero and Dr. Myuu 
would create Super 17 and have him merge with regular #17. Hell would be 
unleashed and the world would be in chaos. Vegetto would find Furiza and 
Cell and defeat them. They would try to send him to hell, but Vegetto would 
be able to resist being sucked into hell and find Super 17. He would fight 
Super 17 and realize that his ki attacks weren't having any effect and power 
up to SSJ3 and try using more ki. Super 17 would continue to absorb 
Vegetto's ki attacks and use Hell Flash but it wouldn't harm Vegetto since 
he was immortal. #18 would arrive and be angry that Super 17 killed Kuririn 
and shoot ki at him. Vegetto would hit Super 17 from behind with a 
Kamehameha and kill him. <BR><BR>
The dragonballs would be collected and Shenlon would say that there was too 
much negative energy in the dragonballs and create the evil Shenlons. 
Vegetto would travel around the world and kill the evil Shenlons one after 
another. SSJ3 Vegetto would find Ii Shenlon and would not be as powerful as 
him since he hadn't reached SSJ4. Ii Shenlon wouldn't be able to defeat 
Vegetto since he was immortal. Ii Shenlon would become very worn out and 
weakened, and SSJ3 Vegetto would use Kamehameha or Final Flash to kill Ii 
Shenlon. Vegetto wouldn't sacrifice his life to purify the dragonballs and 
instead destroy them so that the evil Shenlons couldn't return. He would use 
instantaneous movement to travel to new planet Namek and get a namek to 
create new dragonballs. <BR><BR>
Eventually Vegetto would become tired of living on Earth and get a space 
ship from Capsule Corp to travel to different planets and take over the 
universe.

Well  first since Yamcha being the coward he is would let tien fight first 
since he see's he has to fight Nappa. Mostly tien would die trying his mega 
blast on Nappa and piccolo,krillin,and yamcha would attack Nappa just like 
krillin and Piccolo would have    .Then piccolo would die by Nappa, chauzui 
wouldn't die cause Yamcha would say not to let tien's death be gone to 
waste.By the time piccolo dies Goku makes it ya,  ya , ya , da, da,da . Now 
lets go to the ginuy fight guldo would die easily ,but recoom would beat 
every body.You know the rest,and every thing would be same except there were 
extra people freeza had to fight.(oh , yeah  chouzui would probudly die in 
the hand of freeza)

<b> What if Captain Ginyu had been able to change into Vegeta? </b>- Submitted by <a href="mailto:rvarney@fredericksburgherbfarm.com">Roy Varney</a><br>
Well Gohan and Krillin would of have to start fighting and at first they'd have the upper hand but Capt. Ginyu would slowly begin to get the upper hand. Mean while Vegeta would take goku and put him in the rejuvinantion chamber. {Since Goku was in a Sayain body and Vegeta thought Goku was a Super Sayian} Any way Vegeta would go outside and begin to fight along side Gohan and Krillin but Ginyu would have begun to have been able to control his new body. While Vegeta had not been able to control his body as much because he had not been fighting as much in his new body. The fight would progress and Capt. Ginyu would easily knock out Vegeta. He'd then knock out Krillin this would really pis Gohan off and he'd go all out nearly killing Capt. Ginyu. Capt. Ginyu would then try to change bodies but Gohan would have caught on by now and flew behind Capt. Ginyu. Gohan would then force Capt. Ginyu to change into his orginal body.Vegeta would then kill Capt. Ginyu. By now Dende would have just arrived and would heal Krillin and Gohan but not Vegeta. Then they'd go to the dragonballs and Dende would play dumb as if he'd forgotten the code. Vegeta would send Dende to get the code while he'd take a nap. Together Krillin, Dende, and Gohan would make the same wishes. Vegeta would wake up and Freeza would arrive. Vegeta wouldn't be so airheaded this time and wouldn't tell Freeza to go into his 2nd form. {This would change the series alot!} Krillin would have been knock down into the sea. Gohan would get really angry and do the same thing he did in regular DBZ but this time Freeza would have really really been down for the count. Freeza would then go into his 2nd form Krillin would be up again  and start to fight. Together Vegeta Gohan and Krillin would beat up on Freeza. When Freeza finally nearly kills Vegeta. {This would set them back because even though Vegeta wasn't at full power he did help} Freeza would then go after Gohan still being angry at him. Krillin would stall again in the same way he did in normal DBZ accept this time he'd be able to stall longer because this time in 1st stage Freeza had gotten Gohan's anger attacks instead of his 2nd form by the time Krillin got back Gohan would be healed. Now Piccolo would arrive and beat up Freeza alot. Freeza would go 3rd fom and Piccolo gets beat up. Gohan gets angry and this time his attack would hit Freeza. {Because this time he'd been healed alot more} Any way Freeza would go final form, kill dende, and this time time when Vegeta fights he's stronger because he'd gotten hurt more this time aruond. So Goku shows up earlier but not but much from normal DBZ.. So this time Vegeta lives because he's stronger and Goku arrived earlier any way Vegeta is taken to taken away to the rejuvination chamber by Gohan. The fight goes the same until Goku makes a spirit bomb and he'd have more time to stall because Vegeta is there the rest of the series goes the same....

<b>-NEW- What if Guru had told Nail to go with Krillin and Gohan to fight the Ginyu 
Force? </b>- Submitted by <a href="mailto:pokefreak2002@hotmail.com">Ry Senkari</a><br>
Well, Vegeta would begin arguing with Nail about the Dragonballs. Nail would 
probably have told Krillin and Gohan about the password, but not Vegeta. 
Eventually, they would have agreed that they needed to fight the Ginyu 
Force, so they go to retrieve the 7 Dragonballs just as the Ginyu Force 
arrives. Captain Ginyu would have stolen the Dragonballs and left Recoome, 
Jeice, Berter, and Guldo to fight Nail and the others. Guldo would have 
stepped up to fight, and Nail would have just blasted him into nothing 
before he got a chance to do anything. Vegeta would have started arguing 
with Nail again, since Vegeta wanted to kill Guldo to get his revenge. 
Recoome would have stepped up to fight Nail, but Vegeta would insist Recoome 
fight him instead. Nail would have let Vegeta and Recoome battle, and Vegeta 
would have been beaten. Then, Nail would have stepped in. It would be a good 
fight for a while, until Nail powered up to take Recoome out. Gohan and 
Krillin would just be watching in awe. Next, Berter would have stepped up to 
fight Nail (since Nail would have taken longer to beat Recoome then Goku 
did, Berter probably would have thought he could take Nail by himself). BTW, 
the American Season 2 would have ended just as Berter stepped up to fight 
Nail, to make it more dramatic. Berter would use his size and speed to get 
the jump on Nail. Goku would probably arrive on Namek just as Berter and 
Nail were fighting. While all this was happening, Gohan and Krillin might 
have been talking to Vegeta. Anyway, Goku senses two large power levels and 
rushes to the scene with Senzu Beans. By now, Nail would be winning the 
fight with Berter. The fight between Nail and Berter would stop when Goku 
arrived. Goku would ask Nail who he was, and Gohan would speak up to tell 
Nail about Goku. Goku would read Krillin's mind, and give Vegeta a Senzu 
Bean (for saving them from Dodoria and Zarbon, but not from Guldo (Nail 
killed him)). Anyway, Jeice would go after Goku, and Goku would school him 
easily. Nail would try to kill Berter, but Goku would stop him, giving Jeice 
time to escape. Vegeta would then kill Berter and run after Jeice. Jeice 
would tell Captain Ginyu about Goku and Nail. Just then, Vegeta would show 
up and challenge Captain Ginyu. Vegeta would proceed to beat the crap out of 
Ginyu. While all this was going on, Goku, Nail, Krillin, and Gohan would be 
looking for Frieza's spaceship. Frieza would be getting impatient and also 
go looking for the Dragonballs. Captain Ginyu, knowing that he couldn't beat 
Vegeta, would bodysnatch him and leave with Jeice and the Dragonballs, 
leaving Vegeta at Frieza's spaceship. Captain Ginyu (now in Vegeta's body) 
and Jeice would find Goku, Nail, Gohan, and Krillin and would challenge Goku 
and Nail to a duel. Since Vegeta was a bit stronger than Goku was, Captain 
Ginyu would be a bit more powerful in Vegeta's body, and would whoop Nail. 
Then, Goku would power up to full and take Captain Ginyu on. Jeice would 
attack Gohan and Krillin, and would beat them easily, then take them back to 
Frieza's ship while Goku was distracted with fighting Ginyu. Meanwhile, 
Frieza would arrive back at his ship and see Vegeta in Ginyu's body. Vegeta 
would trick Frieza into putting him into a recovery tank. Frieza would get 
angry, since he thinks that Captain Ginyu failed, but Vegeta would trick 
him, saying that he did manage to keep the Dragonballs. Frieza would put 
Vegeta in a recovery tank and go looking for the Dragonballs. Soon after, 
Jeice would arrive with Gohan and Krillin. Just before he killed them, a 
fully recovered Vegeta (in Ginyu's body) would attack and kill Jeice, then 
put Gohan and Krillin in recovery tanks. He would then go to where Goku was 
fighting Ginyu. It would be a pretty close fight until Vegeta in Ginyu's 
body challenged Ginyu in Vegeta's body. Meanwhile, Goku would eat a Senzu 
Bean and give one to Nail, fully recovering him. Guru would send Dende out 
to look for Gohan and Krillin. Meanwhile, Ginyu (now fully accustomed to 
Vegeta's body) would be beating up Vegeta. Goku would tell Nail to use the 
Dragonballs and wish back Piccolo, but not until Ginyu was dead. Goku would 
then attack Ginyu and beat him up. Ginyu would try to bodysnatch Goku, but 
Vegeta would step in the way and Ginyu and Vegeta would be back in their own 
bodies. Vegeta would then blast Ginyu into oblivion and pass out. Dende 
would arrive, and Nail would wish Piccolo back to life, then back to the 
planet. Gohan and Krillin would finish their recovery just as Frieza arrived 
at his spaceship, mad at Vegeta/Ginyu for lying to him. Just then, Guru 
would die, making the Dragon go away before Goku and Nail could make another 
wish. Dende would arrive and ask where Krillin and Gohan were, and Goku 
would suddenly realize that they were missing! Goku, Nail, and Dende would 
drag Vegeta to Frieza's ship and would find Gohan and Krillin, hiding behind 
a rock. Frieza would appear and Nail would challenge him to a battle. Nail 
would be beaten easily, and Dende would heal Vegeta and Nail. Vegeta would 
challenge Frieza and would coax Frieza into going to his second form. Vegeta 
would still be a good match for Frieza, since Vegeta would have been healed 
twice (once from being beaten up by Recoome, and once more for Goku beating 
up Ginyu in Vegeta's body). Piccolo would arrive on the battlefield, and 
Nail would ask to fuse with Piccolo so that he would have a chance to fight 
Frieza too. Piccolo would reluctantly agree, and after fusing with Nail, 
tell Vegeta to back off. Vegeta, on an ego high, would refuse, and tell 
Frieza to transform again. Frieza would go to his third form, and beat up 
Vegeta. Dende would heal Vegeta again, and Piccolo would also be beaten up. 
Dende would heal Piccolo, then Frieza would transform again and kill Dende. 
Meanwhile, Goku, Gohan, and Krillin would be watching Vegeta fight Frieza 
again. Vegeta would be a little stronger then Goku was when fighting Frieza 
(from being healed 3 times), and put up a good fight, but get beaten when 
Frieza powered up to 50%. Goku would then step in and go Kaioken x20. Vegeta 
would be almost dead, but not quite dead (Goku would step in before that 
happened). Goku would also get beaten by Frieza, and would begin powering up 
a Spirit Bomb. Piccolo would blow up Frieza's ship, drawing Frieza's 
attention away from Goku. Goku would then build his Spirit Bomb and toss it 
at Frieza. Bulma would be scared by the disturbance and run to the 
spaceship. Frieza would then get up and kill Krillin, causing Goku to go 
SSJ. Things would then turn out pretty much like the show, only Ginyu would 
have died, and Vegeta wouldn't have been killed.
