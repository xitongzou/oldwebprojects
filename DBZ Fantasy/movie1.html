<h3><font face="Arial" color="#2F69A8">Movie 1 - The Dead
  Zone</font></h3>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">The film starts off with Piccolo training
  hard, when he is attacked from behind by many enemies, all of which destroy him easily. He
  is attacked by a multitude of powerful energy beams, and seemingly dies.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">We shift to Goku&#146;s house where Gohan
  sits peacefully, doing some routine studying and working hard as ever. He is fascinated by
  the results of the information he&#146;s receiving from the book. Chi-Chi calls Gohan in
  for dinner, before the Ox-King arrives with his hands full of present., Gohan goes to
  greet him, and happily says hello. Suddenly, Ox falls onto his knees revealing a
  mysterious monster of some sort standing behind him. The monster is after the Dragonball
  on Gohan&#146;s hat, but Chi-Chi won&#146;t let him touch her son. Some more monsters join
  the fray, all of which are after Gohan. Chi-Chi lunges into the one who seems to be the
  leader, but is pummeled straight to the floor, as Gohan is captured, and taken away by the
  four monsters.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Goku arrives on the scene shortly after
  everyone leaves, to find his wife and father-in-law on the floor in agony. He quickly sees
  to their needs, then takes off in search of his son.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">The leader of the monsters is sitting on
  his throne, announcing that he almost has all the Dragonballs, and is going to wish for
  eternal life. The monster is Garlic Jr, and his intentions are purely evil. Gohan whines,
  but everyone merely laughs in his face. Garlic can sense some hidden power in him though,
  and invites Gohan to be his disciple.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Goku grabs the Dragon radar, and locates
  his son, before soaring off to rescue him.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Gohan manages to run off from his captors,
  exploring the palace, and finding some sort of alcoholic fruit. He eats it, and goes
  through a weird dance scene where he is totally drunk, dancing around with dinosaurs, etc.
  He ends it by falling asleep on Garlic Jr&#146;s throne, much to his
  &#145;Babysitters&#146; annoyance. Suddenly, someone shouts out that the final Dragonballs
  have been collected.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Garlic Jr summons out Shenron, and quickly
  wishes for immortality before anyone can thwart his plans. Getting the new power gives
  Garlic Jr a new arrogance about him, with a new burst of power making him stronger than
  ever. Goku arrives on the scene, but it is far too late, the wish has already been made.
  Garlic Jr mocks him, then walks off, leaving Goku to battle his minions. Before the fight
  starts though, Kami arrives, meaning that Piccolo isn&#146;t dead. He explains that he
  beat Garlic Jr&#146;s father to the throne of Earth&#146;s guardian, and knows that the
  only reason that Garlic is here is to revenge his fathers defeat. Garlic was sentenced to
  be sealed away for eternity by the previous Earth&#146;s guardian.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Goku realizes where Gohan is, and races
  into the building, leaving Kami to fight Garlic Jr. The Saiyan is ambushed by Garlic
  Jr&#146;s three monsters, and they all fight viciously for a while, with neither of them
  able to gain any sort of advantage on the apposing force. Goku fights them all, and even
  though it is three-on-one, he still manages to overcome them for a fair bit of time. He
  knocks them all to the floor, and demands one of them to tell him where Gohan is. Before
  an answer can be given, the other two minions attack the Saiyan with energy beams, with
  him seeing them too late to put up any sort of defense. Some how they are deflected away
  though. A silhouette is revealed. It&#146;s Krillen! Another power arrives on the
  scene&#133;this time it&#146;s Piccolo! Krillen runs off from him, scared out of his mind.
  Suddenly, some sort of liquid drops on Krillen&#146;s head. Gohan is leaking on him!</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Kami and Garlic Jr continue the ferocious
  battle, with Kami being the distinct loser of it, being pummelled to within an inch of his
  life.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Krillen is left to take care of Gohan,
  whilst Goku and Piccolo easily eliminate the minions, with Goku taking out two, and
  Piccolo taking one. The two most powerful warriors in the world go in search of Garlic Jr,
  to finish him off. They find him, and rough him up a fair bit, teaming up well even though
  they are bitter enemies. They force the evil one to transform, where the fight evens out a
  bit, although Goku and Piccolo still have the overall advantage. Eventually, Garlic Jr
  opens up a portal to another world called the Dead Zone, which will trap whoever goes into
  it for all eternity. It sucks everything in apart from the Earthlings, who all hold onto
  some sort of pillar, or object. Gohan is no where to be seen though,. Goku and piccolo are
  about to be sucked in, and trapped forever, when Gohan bursts out of the rocks, and slowly
  advances on Garlic Jr, somehow nullifying the effects of his attack. He then powers up,
  and nails Garlic Jr, right into his own Dead Zone, locking him away forever where he shall
  suffer his eternal life in solitary darkness.</font></small></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><small><font face="Arial">Everyone walks off, with Gohan not even
  remembering the days events, and not even knowing that he is any sort of a powerful
  fighter.</font></small>
