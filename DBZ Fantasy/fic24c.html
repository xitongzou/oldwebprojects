Episode 20: Disabling Dragonballs</H3>

<P>Previously on Dragonball NR, Goku and Trunks continued to follow Glacial, who, according to Dende, already has 3 Dragonballs. After defeating Bobocco, Losadugrap, and Wexalata, Gohan and Vegeta set off into space to look for Glacial's power source, which was revealed that it existed before Bobocco died. Goten caught up to Goku and Trunks and informed them on what's happening. The Jrs have gone into training while Dende is asking Piccolo how to disable the Dragonballs in case Glacial gets them all. Will Glacial get them all? Find out today on Dragonball NR!

<P>Gohan was searching the ship he was using when he found a radio that would contact the ship that Vegeta was in. "Hey, Vegeta, where do you think we should start looking?"

<P>"You should have a map of where Glacial's planets are. Start with one of those. I'll take the South and East Quadrants' planets. You take the North and West Quadrants' planets. Good luck."

<P>"Okay, talk to ya later," replied Gohan. The ships shot off in different directions.

<P>Goku, Goten, and Trunks were flying towards Glacial.

<P>"How about we split up and find the Dragonballs before Glacial gets them all?" suggested Trunks.

<P>"Good idea, Trunks," said Goku. "Bulma gave me these 3 Dragonradars."

<P>Trunks set off East with a Dragonradar, Goten set off West, and Goku continued heading North.

<P>Piccolo, sensing that Dende wanted him, flew up to Dende's Lookout. "Piccolo, I know that Kami is inside you and I would like to ask him something."

<P>"Sure, what?" said Kami's voice from inside Piccolo.

<P>"You see, I made another set of Dragonballs that react with the old set. I was wondering how I could disable them."

<P>"Here, I'll teach you," said Kami. And Kami began to teach Dende.

<P>Trunks had locked on to a Dragonball and was heading towards it. "Uh-oh, I can feel Glacial's energy coming towards the Dragonball up ahead. I better hurry up." Trunks saw the Dragonball, grabbed it, and went and hid behind a cliff.

<P>"Hmmm," said Glacial, looking around. "My scouter says that the ball shouldn't be hidden by anything." Trunks was trying to keep his power level low, but when Glacial blasted a cliff,(not the one he was hiding behind), it startled Trunks and Glacial got a reading of 1,500 before the power went away. Glacial sniffed the air.

<P>"Come out, Trunks," said Glacial. "My species has the ability to detect people by their smell and I have smellt all of you saiyans already." Trunks put the Dragonball in his jacket pocket and flew up to face Glacial.

<P>"Hand over the Dragonball, foolish boy, or die trying to keep it!"

<P>"I'll never let you have it!" shouted Trunks, turning SS8.

<P>"Why do they prefer the hard way?" Glacial asked himself. "Oh well, just another worthless saiyan out of the way."

<P>"Don't you dare mock my race!" shouted Trunks, lunging at Glacial. They went into hand-to-hand combat. While punching, Trunks was secretly powering up a Burning Attack.

<P>"YAAAAAAAAA!" shouted Trunks, firing his blast. Glacial punched the blast back at Trunks, who was too surprised to dodge it. Trunks fell to the ground, turned back to normal, and the Dragonball rolled out of his pocket.

<P>"I told you," said Glacial. Glacial flew down to Trunks, and was about to crush his head when a blast came out of nowhere. Glacial dodged it and looked up. It was Goten.

<P>"Leave Trunks alone!" shouted Goten, throwing a senzu bean to the barely alive Trunks. Trunks ate it and stood back up. He grabbed the Dragonball and flew over to Goten. "Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"

<P>"I am if I think I know what you're thinking."

<P>"Aww, hell with it. Let's just fuse already." Goten and Trunks fused and became Gotenks.

<P>"Alright Glacial, bring it on," said Gotenks.

<P>All this fighting for 1 measly Dragonball? Let's just hope it's not this way with the rest of the Dragonballs. How many Dragonballs does Goku have? And has Goten gathered any before he came to help Trunks? Speaking of helping Trunks, is Gotenks strong enough to destroy Glacial once and for all? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

Episode 21: Gotenks' Demise</H3>

<P>Previously on Dragonball NR, Dende began learning how to disable the Dragonballs from Piccolo, while Gohan and Vegeta split up to look for Glacial's power source. Speaking of splitting up, Goku, Goten, and Trunks went looking for the Dragonballs separately. Trunks ran into Glacial while he was looking and just when Glacial was about to kill Trunks, Goten came to save the day. After giving Trunks a senzu bean, Goten then fused with Trunks and became Gotenks! Is Gotenks strong enough to defeat Glacial? Find out on today's exciting episode of Dragonball NR!

<P>Gotenks charged at Glacial as a SS8, doing much better than Trunks did alone. Gotenks was powering up another new move called the Burnmeha.

<P>"BURN-ME-HA!" shouted Gotenks. The Burnmeha swirled with red and blue and then became purple. Glacial looked on in horror as the blast hit him.

<P>"YES!" shouted Gotenks.

<P>"Hahahahaha! You actually thought that even injured me? My god, you're a dumbass!" Glacial came out from behind the smoke and smashed Gotenks into the ground.

<P>Gotenks got back up and punched Glacial in the face. Glacial didn't even flinch.

<P>"I hope you're familiar with the next dimension, because that's where you're going to be in 5 minutes if you can't do better than that!" said Glacial.

<P>"BASTARD!" shouted Gotenks, firing as many blasts as he could at Glacial. Glacial knocked Gotenks down again.

<P>"You just don't learn, do you?" asked Glacial. "Oh well. DIE!" Glacial fired a blast at Gotenks, killing him.

<P>"That takes care of them," said Glacial. "Now where did they put that Dragonball? Didn't Trunks pick it up before he fused? Then that means...SHIT!!!!!!!!!"

<P>"Oh well, I can just force Dende to make an extra Dragonball so I can summon the Dragon." Glacial flew off searching for the rest of the Dragonballs.

<P>Meanwhile, Goku had been picking up the power level of Gotenks and then it disappeared. Goku almost dropped his 3 Dragonballs. "NOOOOO!!!!! GLACIAL!" Goku began powering up. He turned SS8. "SONNNN!" Goku let out a wave of anger and turned SS9.

<P>Vegeta, in his ship in space, looked back towards the Earth. So, did Gohan. Even though they were so far away, they could still feel Gotenks' disappearence of power and Goku power boost.

<P>"What in the world is going on down there!?!?!?" shouted Vegeta. "Wait, that's Kakarot's power boosting. KAKAROT!! How can you continue to surpass me? Every time I get stronger than you, an enemy comes that's stronger than both of us. And then the enemy makes either you or your son reach a new level of Super Saiyan! AHHHHHH!" Vegeta began powering up, and when he turned SS9, his whole ship exploded! Vegeta quickly flew over to the closest planet. Vegeta had landed on 1 of Glacial's planets. "Looks like I have some aliens to take out my anger on."

<P>Since Gotenks had 3 Dragonballs, and Glacial has 4 now, Goku used his Super Saiyan speed to collect the rest, which gave him 7. He flew up to Dende's Lookout. Piccolo was talking to Dende. "And that's how you freeze somone in mid-air."

<P>"Dende, I'm taking the Dragonballs and going into space. I need to find Vegeta and fuse with him or we won't stand a chance against Glacial. I'll be back as soon as I find Vegeta. I guess what I'm trying to say is, the Dragonballs are causing lots of harm to the planet and be careful of Glacial while I'm gone. Goodbye." Glacial landed behind Goku.

<P>"Goodbye is right, but you're not going to find Vegeta." Goku turned around. "You're going to fight me right now or die."

<P>"Fine, you give me no other choice." Goku lunged at Glacial and Glacial lunged at Goku.

<P>It looks like Goku isn't in the best situation right now. But as a SS9 is he finally strong enough to take out Glacial? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

<P>Next time on Dragonball NR, Vegeta continues to search for Glacial's power source, which may be closer than everyone thinks! Goten and Trunks head down Snake Way to King Kai's new planet to learn the art of Kaioken. Don't fall off! Meanwhile, Goku faces off against Glacial as the last hope of the planet. In mid-battle the Dragon is summoned! But by who? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

Episode 22: Vegeta's Refusal</H3>

<P>Previously on Dragonball NR, Glacial made quick work of Gotenks and only afterwards did he realize he had destroyed 3 Dragonballs. Extremely annoyed, Glacial set off towards Dende's Lookout, where Goku was telling Dende that he was going into space to find Vegeta so that they could fuse. But Glacial had a different idea. "You're not going anywhere. You're going to fight me right now or die instantly!" Now, faced with a bigger problem than finding Vegeta, Goku must give his all against Glacial as the last hope of the planet. Is Goku strong enough to defeat Glacial? Find out today on Dragonball NR!

<P>Goten and Trunks were speeding down Snake Way.

<P>"Hey Trunks, my dad came here a long time ago to learn Keiokan or whatever it is. Your dad never learned it. When we get brought back, are you gonna teach your dad?"

<P>"Probably if I can and he'll let me."

<P>"Oh."

<P>Vegeta was approaching one of the buildings on the planet. One soldier ran outside. He glanced at Vegeta.

<P>"RED ALERT! IT'S VEGETA!" Hundreds of men came out and started firing guns. Vegeta kept walking and killed all of them.

<P>"Come on, Goku. Fight like you mean it!" shouted Glacial. Glacial kicked Goku in the gut and knocked him into the floor of the lookout. Goku got back up and charged at Glacial as a SS9. Goku punched Glacial in the gut and continued punching him in the gut. Goku then prepared a Kamehameha wave.

<P>"KA-ME-HA!" shouted Goku. Glacial had the wind knocked out of him and heard Goku shouting so he glanced over. "NO!" Panic began to spread over Glacial. "You can't! You would never aim the Kamehameha wave at the Earth!!! Goku, have you completely lost it? You wouldn't destroy the planet just to defeat me?!?!"

<P>"MEEEEEEE!" Glacial looked at Goku in horror. "YOU FOOL!" Goku used the Instant Transmission, just like he did against Cell, to go behind Glacial.

<P>"HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!" The Kamehameha wave hit head-on. 
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"

<P>Goten and Trunks landed on King Kai's planet. King Kai came outside. "Oh, hello there. You're Goten and Trunks, right?"

<P>"Yep!" said Goten.

<P>"Well boys, I'm afraid I can't teach you."

<P>"WHAT!?!?"

<P>"I'm afraid that I wouldn't be able to teach you enough. So, I'm going to send you to Shin's planet instead. He can teach you Kaioken and a lot more than I can. So, just touch my shoulder and I'll take you to Shin's planet."

<P>"Okay," said Goten. King Kai teleported them to Shin's planet. Shin turned around.

<P>"Ah, I sensed you coming here," said Shin. "North Kai, I would be honored to teach them Kaioken."

<P>"Great! I better go and check on the situation on Earth," said King Kai.

<P>"Tell them I wish them luck," said Shin. King Kai left.

<P>The bottom half of Glacial's body was all that was left of him. Goku looked down at Glacial in disgust. Goku turned to Dende.

<P>"Goku, behind!" shouted Piccolo. Goku turned around and saw the bottom of Glacial's body jump up. It was standing there as if it had an evil smile on it's face. It kicked Goku square in the face, knocking him to the ground.

<P>It started shaking, and then Glacial regrew his torso! Then, Glacial began laughing. "Ahahahhahahahahaha! Goku, you've surprised me at your strength. I guess I surprised you as well. This isn't even the peak of my power though. Like my father, I can transform!" Dende and Mr Popo  gasped. Piccolo looked shocked. Goku began to get angry.

<P>'If only I could somehow summon the dragon,' thought Goku.

<P>"Well, are you ready to see the power that will destroy you, this planet and the rest of the universe? HAAAAAAAA!" shouted Glacial. He began to power up. "YAAAAAAAAAAHA!" Glacial body started glowing and changing shape. Then, he finished transforming. Now he looked like Frieza in his second form only Glacial had shades of blue instead of white, pink, and purple.

<P>"Well, Goku, what do you think? Am I strong enough to destroy the universe, or just the galaxy?"

<P>Goku just stood there in disbelief. Glacial, annoyed at not getting an answer, leaped at Goku and knocked him to the ground. Suddenly, Glacial froze, not moving an inch.

<P>"Goku," said Dende,"I froze him in mid-air. Hurry and summon the dragon! There's no time to waste!"

<P>"Right!" said Goku. "Arise, Shenron!" The sky suddenly turned black and Shenron shot up into the air.

<P>"You have summoned me, and in return I will grant you 3 wishes that are within my power."(Shenron gave them 3 wishes in the Buu Saga)

<P>"Alright, now what was I going to wish for? Oh yeah, could you bring Vegeta back to planet Earth?"

<P>"Just a minute..."

<P>Meanwhile...

<P>"No power source here. Guess I'll steal a ship and head for the next one," said Vegeta.

<P>"Vegeta..." said Shenron,"a wish has been made for you to go to planet Earth. Would you like to go?"

<P>"No, why would I?"

<P>"That's all I wanted to know."

<P>Back on Earth...

<P>"Vegeta refuses to come."

<P>"What?!?" shouted Goku.

<P>This looks like a bad situation for Goku. But with Shenron summoned, is there another chance? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

<P>Next time on Dragonball NR, Goten and Trunks finish up learning Kaioken and then get a surprise gift from Shin! Gohan continues to search for Glacial's power source while Goku and Vegeta argue using Shenron's abilities to help them. Just when things are looking like they couldn't get any worse, Dende loses too much energy and can no longer keep Glacial frozen. With Glacial free and Shenron here, is Glacial going to get his wish? Will the Juniors be able to help? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

Episode 23: Relying on Shenron</H3>

<P>Previously on Dragonball NR, Goten and Trunks went down Snake Way to recieve training from King Kai, who decided to have Shin teach them instead. Meanwhile, on Dende's Lookout, Glacial fought with Goku for awhile and then transformed! After transforming, Dende froze Glacial in place and told Goku to summon Shenron. Goku wished that Vegeta, who's ship had been destroyed when he turned SS9, be returned to Earth. Vegeta refused to come, which shocked Goku, who now has to wish for something else. What will Goku wish for? Find out today on Dragonball NR!

<P>"Here is a gift," said Shin, handing 1 small item to each Goten and Trunks. Goten and Trunks had already mastered Kaioken, and the mysterious Finihan moves and powers and Shin had granted them the ability to breath in space.

<P>"Hmmm," said Goku. "I'll just have to wish for something else. Shenron, could you bring Goten and Trunks back to life?"

<P>"It shall be done," said Shenron. Shenron's eyes glowed and then Goten and Trunks' halos disappeared.

<P>"Hey, you've been brought back!" exclaimed Shin. "But, I should teleport you to Earth now. Let's go!" Shin, Goten, and Trunks left for Earth.

<P>"You fools! You'll never get away with this!" shouted Glacial. "I'm not waiting a year!"

<P>"Just keep tryin, Glacial. But you'll never make it," said Goku.

<P>"What is your next wish?" rumbled Shenron. Suddenly, Shin appeared with Goten and Trunks.

<P>"Hey guys!" said Goku.

<P>"Thanks for wishing us back, Goku," said Trunks.

<P>"No problem."

<P>'Hey dad,' said Gohan, telepathically,'I don't think Glacial's power source is in space at all. It must be on Earth somewhere. Bobocco said we wouldn't have destroyed it if we destroyed every other planet, so it must be on Earth.'

<P>'Good job, son!'

<P>"Shenron! I would like you to bring Gohan and Vegeta to Earth right away! I don't care if Vegeta refuses, bring him anyway!"

<P>"It shall be done!" Gohan and Vegeta appeared behind Goten, Shin, and Trunks.

<P>"Kakarot, what the hell are you doing? I refused to be brought here so why am I here?"

<P>"Hey guys, I can't hold him much longer!" shouted Dende. "My energy is low. I can't hold him!!!!" Glacial broke free and lunged at Goku.

<P>"HOLD IT!!" Everyone turned around. Piccolo had froze Glacial in mid-air.

<P>"Thanks, Piccolo," said Goku.

<P>"Goku, hurry up and make the last wish!"

<P>"Right," said Goku. "Shenron, can you kill Glacial?"

<P>"It is not within my power to do so."

<P>"How about-" Goku was cut short by 3 huge power level ratings almost as high as his. Then, the Juniors came out from around a corner.

<P>"Wow, they've been training really hard," said Gohan.

<P>"Yeah, but what are we gonna wish for?" asked Goten.

<P>"Whatever you do, do it quick!" shouted Piccolo. "Aahhhhhh!" Glacial broke free of Piccolo's mind freeze.

<P>"Not in my part of the universe!" shouted Shin, as he now froze Glacial.

<P>"Kakarot, answer me!" shouted Vegeta.

<P>"Just be patient, you insolent fool!" shouted Goku. "We have an evil alien, stronger than anyone we've ever faced, Shenron is here, and all you care about is finding out why you're not in space, jacking off! Just shut up!"

<P>"FINE! JUST HURRY UP!"

<P>"Shenron," said Goku,"please tell us where Glacial's power source is."

<P>"That is not possible," rumbled Shenron. "It is a sacred hidden source that I am not even able to fathom."

<P>"Could you teleport Glacial to the other end of the universe?"

<P>"I can only take him to where the old planet Namek was. He would be able to get back here in 5 days. Shall I grant the wish?"

<P>"Yes, there's no other option," said Goku.

<P>"It shall be done," said Shenron. Shenron's eyes began to glow red and Glacial disappeared. "I have fulfilled 3 wishes and now I bid you farewell." Shenron then disappeared and the Dragonballs scattered across the Earth in stone.

<P>"What do we do now?" asked Goku Jr.

<P>What do you do now is right! With Glacial away from Earth for 5 days, will the Z fighters be able to stop him when he comes back? Find out next time on Dragonball NR!

<P>Next time on Dragonball NR, Glacial furiously races back to Earth, but then decides to head to New Namek instead since their Dragonballs can still be used!
