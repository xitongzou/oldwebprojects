              22nd Tenkaichi Budoukai - Review</font></b></font> </div>
            <p>The 22nd Tenkaichi Budoukai takes place in 753 A.D., 3 years after 
              the previous Budoukai. There are a total of 182 contestants in this 
              years Budoukai and after the blocks are picked we see that all of 
              the Z fighters are in seperate blocks besides Gokuh and Yamucha, 
              but they will still not fight each other until late in the Budoukai. 
              The first preliminary match for Yamucha is against Mohichan and 
              Yamucha easily wins. In the next match Kuririn fights against Oootako, 
              who is the same guy that Gokuh had faced three years ago in the 
              preliminary rounds. Just as Gokuh did, Kuririn easily wins the match. 
              The next match has Tenshinhan fighting Sumou Tori and Tenshinhan 
              brags about how strong he is. Tenshinhan steps in the ring and quickly 
              desposes of his opponent, everyone, but Gokuh is surprised at Tenshinhan's 
              strength. Gokuh in his next preliminary match fights against Chapa-ou 
              and Chapa is a very strong opponent and this is expected to be a 
              good match. Well, it isn't, Gokuh is still too strong and he ends 
              up blowing Chapa out of the ring, everyone is surprised with Gokuh's 
              strength. In the final preliminary match we see that involves the 
              Z fighters, Jackie Chun fights Bear Man and ends up winning after 
              knocking him unconscious. So, now that we are out of the preliminary 
              rounds we are left with an 8 block competition to decide who will 
              be the world champion. </p>
            <p>The 22nd Tenkaichi Budoukai 8-block finals </p>
            <p>With the help of Chouzo, the pairings are set up and the first 
              match will face Tenshinhan up against Yamucha. </p>
            <p>Tenshinhan vs. Yamucha </p>
            <p>Besides the fact that Tenshinhan and Yamucha are now rivals, there 
              masters are also rivals. Kamesennin is an enemy of Tenshinhan's 
              trainer tsurusennin. So, now we start the match, though. As the 
              match begins the crowd sees that both of the fighters are fast and 
              Tenshinhan is happy to be fighting someone of Yamucha's strength. 
              Yamucha uses his Wolf Fang Attack, but it does not work. After some 
              more fighting, Yamucha attemtps to do a Kame Hame Ha and it works, 
              it is weak though and Tenshinhan just reflects it back at the boy. 
              Yamucha jumps up in the air, but he does not see that Tenshinhan 
              is now above him and Tenshinhan knocks out Yamucha. Tenshinhan continues 
              to fight, though, and he breaks Yamucha's leg. Finally, Tenshinhan 
              is declared the winner. </p>
            <p>Jackie Chun vs. Man-Wolf </p>
            <p>Right off the bat we find out why Man-Wolf hates Jackie Chun. Well, 
              whenever there is a full moon, Man-Wolf turns from a wolf into a 
              man. Well, he had meet a girl, but during the previous Budoukai, 
              Jackie Chun had destroyed the moon. Now, this Man-Wolf was not able 
              to turn into a man and be with this girl. Man-Wolf wanted to fight 
              Jackie Chun so he could get revenge. The match begins and Jackie 
              Chun immediately knocks down his opponent. Man-wolf pulls out a 
              knife and even though this is illegal, the match continues. He is 
              not able to hurt Jackie though and now Jackie convinces the his 
              opponent that he is a dog and gets him to chase a bone out of the 
              ring, causing him to lose the match. After a minute, the wolf runs 
              back into the ring, but Jackie has him look at the &quot;moon&quot;, 
              which is actually Kuririn's bald head. The Wolf is turned back into 
              a man and runs off happily. </p>
            <p>Kuririn vs. Chouzo </p>
            <p>Chouzo starts off the match by knocking Kuririn around and then 
              Chouzo flies out of the ring to saftey. From there he gets ready 
              to use his special attack which is the Dodon Pa. At the same time, 
              Kuririn powers up to use the Kame Hame Ha, but it is a fact that 
              the Dodon Pa is stronger than the Kame Hame Ha. Kuririn jumps in 
              the air and fires off his attack, hitting Chouzo and it looks as 
              though he will win. Chouzo uses his paralyze technique, though to 
              paralyze Kuririn's heart. Kuririn, though, says a match problem 
              to break Chouzo's concentration and gets in a hit. After doing the 
              same thing for a second time, Kuririn is able to defeat Chouzo. 
            </p>
            <p>Gokuh vs. Panputto </p>
            <p>Well, Panputto has won many world championships, so it is expected 
              to be a good match. However, Gokuh easily knocks out his opponent 
              after getting in some hits with his elbow </p>
            <p>The Final 4 </p>
            <p>Jackie Chun vs. Tenshinhan </p>
            <p>At the beginning of the match there is some talking exchanged and 
              then the match starts. The two fighters are very evenly matched 
              and Tenshinhan wants to know who Jackie Chun really is. Tsurusennin 
              then through telepathy tells Tenshinhan that Jackie Chun is actually 
              Kamesennin. After seeing some more moves from Tenshinhan, Jackie 
              Chun jumps out of the ring to be disqualified. </p>
            <p>Kuririn vs. Gokuh </p>
            <p>Well, on and off all throughout the match the two take breaks to 
              say how much fun they are having. After fighting for a while Kuririn 
              realizes that he will not beat Gokuh with his Muscle or speed, so 
              he plans on tricking Gokuh. Kuririn fires a Kame Hame Ha, but only 
              to distract Gokuh so that he can grab his tail. Gokuh then tells 
              Kuririn that, that is no longer a weakness of his, though. Gokuh 
              begins to fight seriously though and begins to hop around the match 
              so quickly that he becomes invisable. All of a sudden he reappears 
              in front of Kuririn and surprised Kuririn so much that Kuririn jumps 
              out of the ring and Gokuh wins the match </p>
            <p>The Championship Match </p>
            <p>Tenshinhan vs. Gokuh </p>
            <p>The match begins and the two fighters appear to be evenly matched, 
              but then Tenshinhan goes in for the death blow by using his Volley 
              Ball technique, but Goku is fine after the move. In the middle of 
              the match, though, all of a sudden Gokuh can not move and this happens 
              many times. What is happening is that Chouzo is paralyzing Gokuh 
              so that Tenshinhan can get in hits and win the match. Finally, though, 
              Tenshinhan yells out to stop and Chouzo does. Tsurusennin goes to 
              kill Chouzo, but Kamesennin comes to a rescue with a Kame Hame Ha 
              and the match continues. Tenshinhan uses a technique where he grows 
              an extra set of arms, but in return, Gokuh uses the eight arms technique 
              and knocks Tenshinhan around. Tenshinhan is now upset and plans 
              on using Kikoho. Tenshinhan fires off the blast and even though 
              Gokuh jumps in the air and avoids the blast, the rind is now gone. 
              Since Tenshinhan can float, once Gokuh lands he will lose the match. 
              However, Gokuh uses a Kame Hame Ha to propel himself into Tenshinhan, 
              so now both the fighters are falling to the ground. Since Gokuh 
              will be the first one to hit he uses the last of his power to form 
              a Kame Hame Ha which will slow his fall. At the last moment however, 
              Gokuh hits a van which causes him to touch the ground first and 
              Tenshinhan is declared the winner. </p>
            <p>After The Match </p>
            <p>Well, everyone is now friends and Tenshinhan offers to split the 
              money with Gokuh, but Gokuh declines. So, instead, Tenshinhan says 
              that he will take them all out to eat. To bad it is all interupted 
              by Kuririn's death, though. </p>
