Prologue:  Memories Stay With the Soul.

She could feel the knife assaulting her now lonesome heart, yet there was no blood. 
Memories and sorrow were the only things that dispensed from the large wound that 
filled her soul. 

Standing there in the darkness, she wondered what the future would hold.  It wasn’t 
so much her prospect that she was worried about, because she knew her time in this 
life was now coming to an end.  The anxiety was for him, and what his life would be 
like after she departed from this world.

Her lengthy slim fingers ran through his blaze of black hair and a slight smile appeared 
on a face that now a days hardly ever saw one.  They continued to moved across his small 
features and along his high cheek bones as the quiet night wrapped him in slumber. He 
was starting to resemble his father more and more each day.  The only feature that he 
carried of her was the shape of the eyes.  She had to confess somehow she felt disappointed.

As she watched her young son sleep, it was a moment that she wished with all her heart 
could last forever. But that same old feeling brushed over her as memories of the day 
haunted her like unrested spirits.  The pain for what tomorrow would bring rushed back  
every time she tried to relax or get comfortable.  She winced a little as her fingers touched 
the largest souvenir.  Her right cheek was aching from the large bruise that covered the skin 
and a tiny crystal blue tear ran its way down her cheek like a lonely rain drop in a shower 
empty storm.

The King had never meant to strike her the way he did, she understood because she could 
hear his thoughts through the bond they both shared.  That was the first time he ever 
laid a hand on her.  The only other time the King had done that was the first time they 
ever sparred together, when she first went to work in the Saiya-jin elite eight years earlier.  
For a moment she was taken back on how long it had been.  It was hard to believe eight 
years had gone by and it was even harder to comprehend how far she had come in such a short 
time.

She was not angry at the King for the smack across the face that left a painful 
reminder, she had forgiven him.  Her rage was for what he had done to their people, the 
planet and their son.   The King’s fear had signed the death warrants of not only him, but all 
that was held dear.   Then their son, who was only five years of age,  was now on his way to be 
a personal slave for that fiend, while he held the Saiya-jin empire in his slimy grasp.  She 
was going to lose the only thing that she loved more then life itself and more tears 
streamed down her face.

Gently she placed a kiss on the boy’s forehead and whispered silently in his ear, “Although 
I will not live to see such a deed, you will one day see what a monster he is, my son.  
When that day comes, you will show that beast what a real Saiya-jin can do.”  The boy 
wiggled a little at the breath that tickled his ear, but did not wake.  “Sleep well my son.”

Rising up, her lengthy brown hair fell around her, as she silently walked to the door.  She turned 
to glance one last time at the small sleeping figure and knew deep down that she would never 
see him like this ever again.  The concluding days had arrived and their time was up.

Chapter 1:  She Was A Disappointment.

15 Years Earlier

Her petite body struggled to stand up, as she wiped away a small river of blood running 
down from her lip.  Blackness was beginning to blanket her vision, but she couldn't 
surrender.  She had tried so hard, yet failed so many times.  Now all eyes were staring 
at her, some in amusement and others in sympathy.   She hated when people gave her 
empathy; it made her feel weak.  Then there was those large dark eyes staring down at her in 
disappointment, which made her realize it was futile.

She shrieked in pain as she felt her body slam back into the ground, and the black sandy 
grime clogged her nostrils and throat, as she was squashed on to her stomach. The pressure 
from the weight on top of her was so great that she was unable to haul herself up.  Blood 
mixed with slime as she couched up the mud in her throat.  She heard a sinister laugh come 
from her opponent, then another sharp pain engulfed her body, as her eyes shut tight and her 
face turned red.  She heard the gasps from the small crowd watching a few feet away.  The 
pain was so intense, that she wanted to cry out, but that was only for weak Saiya-jins 
and in their society Saiya-jins like that did not survive long or were sent away.  The 
strong hand continued to yank at her brown tail, while his weight pressed into her further.  
Finally, tears clouded her vision and the throbbing soreness that raced around her body 
won, she screamed out, begging to be released.

"Shanu!"  Roared a familiar voice.  She shrieked out again as her opponent pulled harder.  
"SHANU! The voice was now enraged. "I said, enough Turles!  Let Vitka go, right now!"

Her face fell back into the muck, as Turles let her tail go.  Vitka could hear him 
growl, feeling his weight disappear.  There was a quiet sign of relief, as heavy footsteps
approached and her weary eyes looked up upon the intimidating form of her grandfather.

The older superior Saiyan stood before the smaller ones.  His old eyes narrowed as he 
looked at the pathetic lump that was his only granddaughter.  "Turles, how many times 
must it be made clear to you, that pulling a Saiya-jin tail is an illegal move and you 
will be disqualified from the Saiya-jin academy try outs."  His voice was lowered with 
every word that passed his lips, as he tried to hide the anger and disappointment.

Another growl escaped the 14 year old boy's throat as he stood in front of the old 
Saiya-jin with his arms crossed and a deep scowl upon his face.  His black pointed hair 
wildly hung about his head, with the air as its only support. His white chest armor was 
cracked and the black cloth like material underneath it clung to his tan skin, which 
glowed with tiny beads of sweat, as his tail curled around his waist. 

"I don't need advice from you old man.  It is not my fault that she has such a feeble power 
level and can't compete."  Turles kicked some mud into Vitka's face.  "Besides, weaklings 
like her need to be put in their place." He smirked.

"Turles that is enough!"  The two heads turned to see two other young Saiya-jins 
approached the small group, one 12 years and the other 10 years.  The 12 year old male 
looked exactly like Turles' clone, the only difference between the two was this Saiya-jin 
was two inches shorter and his skin was not quite as tan as his older brother's.  The 
second a 10-year-old female, who was about the same size stepped from behind the other. 
She had long black hair that hung in the air like spikes and was tied back in a neat ponytail. 
Her brown eyes had the hint of worry as she picked up her childhood friend off the ground.

"Come to save the day, as usual little brother?"

"Choose your words wisely Turles, maybe Vitka wasn't a match, but you know that I will be 
glad to finish what she started."  Bardock growled through clenched teeth.

"Are you ok Vitka?"  Taanipu lifted Vitka's arm around her shoulder for support.

Vitka couched out a few more drops of blood, "Yeah, I..." Then blackness cloaked her vision.

"Bardock, Taanipu, take Vitka to the Regeneration Tank."  The old Saiya-jin bellowed.

Turles chuckled and yelled out at the three, "she should have been send away like the 
rest to some remote planet."  His laughs could be heard around the arena, along with 
the other young students. "Then again the inhabitants of that planet would be lucky to 
have such a weakling as their conqueror."

As the words left his lips, the laughing from the crowd turned into gasps as Turles 
suddenly felt a sharp pain rupture through his stomach, he lay implanted into the ground. 
When Turles realized what had happened he was staring into the into the cold, angry eyes of 
his younger brother.  Like an animal after it has caught its prey, Bardock fury rose
with every passing second.  

Bardock and Vitka had known each other since they were small. Both had grown up at 
Vitka's grandfather's small academy. Where young Saiya-jin go to train, before they 
are excepted into the larger one, where their destinies are decided.   Even though, Bardock 
was two years older then her and for a third class Saiya-jin had made it too much higher 
levels of skill, then Vitka could barely reach as a second class Saiya-jin, he regarded 
her as his best friend.  

Bardock could never explain why he felt it was his job to watch over her and protect 
her, maybe it was because they had so many things in common with each other.  Their 
parents were dead, well Bardock and Turles' father was still alive, but for all intentsive 
purposes he was dead.  Their father cared little about either of his sons and had not 
bothered with them in many years.  It was at a point where Bardock could not even remember 
what his father looked like. 

The real reason was they could talk to each other about anything and 
somehow, both filled each other's sadness.  For Bardock it was more of a feeling of 
love, which  he tried to deny many times, but failed.

"I warned you. "  Bardock's voice was cold, as he came back from his thoughts.  He could 
hear the shouts coming from the others, but he didn't care.  His fist raised slowly into
the air, he was ready to strike.

Turles closed his eyes and smirked, waiting patiently for his brother blows.  He enjoyed 
building rage in others.  But to his disappointment the knock never came.  Bardock fist 
was still raised in the air, but it had another hand enfolded around it, which was 
connected to the older Saiya-jin's.

No words were spoken only expressions told the tale.  As Bardock removed himself off of 
Turles and lifted Vitka other arm up around his shoulder. He and Taanipu continued on
their way carrying her to the medical room, to be placed in the tank.

The arrogant smirk of Turles still covered his face, "Well, I think I have had my fun 
for the day.  Wouldn't you say old man?" Vitka's grandfather never moved, keeping his 
back to the boy. 

Turles ominous laugh filled the arena once more. He neatly bushed himself off and left 
in the opposite direction.  The crowd of students headed back to their rooms, jabbing 
about the days events to one another.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bardock and Taanipu watched their friend flooding in the murky green water of the 
tank, as the regeneration water, started to heal the cuts and bruises from her worn out body.  
The Physician or Peony in Saiya-jin tongue, to their relief stated that they had gotten 
her there just in time.  Her wounds were healing nicely and in a few hours she 
would be fine.  There was silence in the room as both waited for their friend to heal.

Taanipu small hand touched the glass tank, as she stared at the naked form of her friend.  
The only item covering Vitka's body was the oxygen mask, to keep the water from getting 
into her lungs.  Like Bardock, Taanpiu had also grown up with Vitka.  The three had become 
inseparatable over the years, always hanging around together and were never usually 
apart for very long.  It hurt to see her friend like this, struggling so hard to compete 
and make it to the top, but always being one step behind.  Taanipu had also surpassed 
Vitka in many areas, which was not easy considering they were the same level and class.  
Tears started to form in her eyes, but she held back, crying was for the weak.

Suddenly, Bardock and Taanipu were both taken off guard as the Medical Room door 
opened, and Vitka's grandfather stepped through.

"How is she?"

"She is fine, the Peony said she would out in a few hours." Bardock said respectly.

The old Saiya-jing nodded, "I think you two, should go get cleaned up and get some rest. 
The try outs are in a few days and you will need all your strength."  His eyes seem
to stare out in space.

Bardock and Taanipu were about to protest, but decided against it when they saw the 
seriousness of his face.  Nodding they took one last look at Vitka and headed 
out of the room.


The Medical Room was an erie place, when empty.  The walls were white and padded down.
No windows anywhere, only the automatic door's sphere like porthole gave any evidence of an 
outside world.  The only sounds were the computers moderating the different equipment around
it, from regerenation tanks to life support systems.  The air was bitter and the smell
had the power to make anyone sick from just standing there, it was mostly from the 
regerenation water that was used as a healing tool to all Saiya-jins.

 
He just stood there with his arms crossed and eyes shut tight.  Thinking, just thinking 
about whether he had done the right thing, by them keeping her here.  Yes, at birth her power
level was weak only a level 3, which was extremely disgraceful in many Saiya-jin eyes.
They suggested that she be sent away, to another planet, like so many others, using
her weak power to take over the planet to be sold one day.  Vitka's parents, his son, 
refused to allow them to do that, they both swore that if trained right she could become
powerful.  Over the years, Vitka built up her power level and accomplished many skills, 
however she was still behind her peers and it was literally killing her.  Now, that her 
parents were gone, all she had was her grandfather and all he had was her.

"So, old friend, I heard what happened."

The old Saiya-jin felt a hand on his shoulder and turned to see Paragas one of his
old students from many years before, who now was one of the fighting instructures to 
the students who entered here.

"Varen you are becoming too soft.  You do realize it was a mistake to keep her here."

Varen turned his head around, his back now faced the younger Saiya-jin. His gaze 
fell once again upon his granddaughter.

"I know."  He whispered.

Paragas raised an eyebrow and smirked, "Well, your son was a stubborn man. But, I wouldn't
worry.  I am sure there is a purpose for the girl and we will find it out someday."

Unexpectedly,  Both jumped as they heard the door fly open.  Tiku, one of the many students
and a messenger rushed in, out of breath and on his knees.  He looked as though he had 
been running for hours.  Varen stepped forward staring down at the boy. 

"What is it?"

"I have a message from the palace."

"Well speak up boy, neither of us have all day."  Varen crossed his arms and a scowl
appeared on his face.

"The King.....he....he...is dead."  Tiku faught to catch his breath.  

"By who's hand?"  Varen asked.

"The Prince."

Varen and Paragas quickly glanced at one another.  There was a moment of shock, but it soon
faded into the air.  The Saiya-jin tradition was nothing new to either men.  Through out
their history most rulers were killed by their own offspring, when they were seen as unfit to
rule.

Paragas just smirked, "well looks like the prince was able to kill the weakling after all. 
About time too, the old fool was starting to become bothersome."

Varen nodded, rubbing his chin. "Yes, but I wonder what this new change will bring to 
the empire."
