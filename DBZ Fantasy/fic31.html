Part 1</H3>

<P>The sun was shining directly above Gohan's house (#_#) Master Roshie had 
decided to invite him self over for some tea and everything seemed pretty 
dull.

<P>`Man dad what's taking so long?` Gohan thought.
He sighed and looked toward the window.

<P>"GOHAN!" screamed Chi Chi, "Why do you have to have such bums for friends?!"
"Get out of my house you pervert!"

<P>Master Roshie shook at Chi Chi's feet praying for his life.
"Please Chi Chi I'm sor..."

<P>He was cut of by a pot swung at his head causing him to fly out of the room.
"And don't come back!!!"

<P>Gohan sighed again and thought to him self 'at least some things haven't 
changed'
then started to giggle after he had figured out what had happed.

<P>"I don't think things will ever change" Gohan said giggling.

<P>Gohan was right some things will never changed but in this case...
He was terribly wrong.

<HR width="85%">

<P>The next day Gohan pleaded with his mother, again...

<P>"NO!" screamed Chi chi. "I will not have my son turned into a brain dead 
hooligan!"

<P>"But mom"

<P>"No buts Gohan, you cannot join that martial arts class and that's final!"

<P>"Now, don't you have some studying to do?"

<P>Gohan sighed and thought to him self...
'Dad would let me join'

<P>Drugging back to his room he saw it.
"Hey!" Gohan said playfully.  "Icuris!"

<P>"Raaaaaachaa" said Icuris.

<P>"Oh really?" said Gohan as if he understood him.
"Well I have the perfect place to play!"

<P>Icuris turned to the window and Gohan followed.
He jumped on his back and they flew off.

<P>"NO!!!" screamed Chi chi (once again)
"You haven't even done one problem on your homework yet!"

<P>But it was too late...
They were already long gone.

<HR width="85%">

<P>By the time they got to the class it was almost over.

<P>"Hey, wait for me!" said Gohan as he touched down.

<P>The other children were giggling as Gohan approached them

<P>"Well..." Said the instructor.
"It looks like we will be having one more today"
"And what is your name young man?"

<P>"uhh..." Gohan stuttered as the other children continued to giggle.
"... Gohan" he finally stuttered.

<P>"Well Gohan you can be our volunteer"

<P>Gohan smiled.
'Maybe if I make a good impression early on he will excuse my being late'

<P>Stepping forward proudly he approached his master.

<P>"Now Gohan I'd like to see how well you can fight." Said his teacher.
"Don't be afraid if you can't do it though."

<P>Gohan nodded and they both bowed.

<P>"Okay Gohan you may begi..."
A light blow to the stomach interrupted him.

<P>Gohan nervously apologized.
"Oh no, I'm sorry was I supposed to start later?"

<P>The teacher replied with difficulty
"No., it's okay Gohan"
"Your just better than I expected"

<P>The other children stair in ah as they continue fighting.

<P>Gohan manages to bring him down in less than a few seconds, keeping in mind 
to try not to hurt him.

<P>"Gohan!" said the teacher.
"You are exhalent!"

<P>After the other kids left the teacher told Gohan to stay behind.

<P>"Gohan?"

<P>"Yes?" said Gohan curiously

<P>"I've never shown any one this"
"Can I trust you to keep a secret"?

<P>"Uhh... sure" Gohan stuttered.

<P>"Good"
"Now then, I found this belt in the forest"
"I was wondering if you know what "Ki" is?"

<P>The teacher handed him the belt and Gohan studied it for a while.

<P>The inscription on the belt read:
-The Person Who Has The Ultimate Ki Will Succeed In The Journey-

<P>"Any Idea what it means?" Said the teacher.

<P>"Well I know what Ki i..."
"Yaaaaaaaaaa!!"

<P>All of a sudden it looked like Gohan was being sucked into a black hole.
Electricity formed all around him as the belt wrapped around his waste.

<HR width="85%">

<P>When Gohan woke up he was in a strange place.

<P>"Whe... where am I" Gohan stuttered

<P>Then something moved in the corner of the room.

<P>"Who's there!" screamed Gohan.

<P>A dark shadow loomed over the room.

<P>Standing in the shadow was a creature that was the same height as Gohan, and 
was staring at Gohan with big black eyes.

<P>"Who are you?" Gohan said slowly

<P>The creature stepped out of the shadows and revealed him self.

<P>The creature began to speak.
"Well who'd you think I was?"

<P>The creature came closer and Gohan could see that it was actually human.

<P>The mysterious stranger spoke one last time.
"I'm you."

&lt;The Truth&gt;</H3>

<EM>RECAP of last few sentences:</EM>

<HR width="85%">

<P>"Who's there!" screamed Gohan.

<P>A dark shadow loomed over the room.

<P>Standing in the shadow was a creature that was the same height as Gohan,
and was staring at Gohan with big black eyes.

<P>"Who are you?" Gohan said slowly

<P>The creature stepped out of the shadows and revealed himself.

<P>The creature began to speak.
"Well who'd you think I was?"

<P>The creature came closer and Gohan could see that it was actually human.

<P>The mysterious stranger spoke one last time.
"I'm you."

<HR width="85%">

<P>Gohan could not believe what he was hearing.
"What?" Gohan said with a shaky voice.

<P>"You heard me," said the Gohan look a like.
"I'm you."

<P>Gohan franticly looked around for an answer.
He had be laying on a normal sized bed -nothing special-
and the room looked almost like his did, only there was nothing in it, just 
the bed.

<P>Gohan stood up and peered out the window.
He couldn't believe it!
It was completely empty!

<P>There was no ground, it was just... emptiness... not even a hole.

<P>&lt;Maybe It's my martial arts teacher trying to test me&gt; thought Gohan.

<P>Reacting strictly on his gut feeling Gohan charged at his double.

<P>"Yaahaaaaaauuua!!"
A scream of pain came out of Gohan's mouth as the duplicate kneed him in the 
stomach.

<P>&lt;On the other hand...&gt;

<P>"Uhyaa!" The evil Gohan began to power up!

<P>"Huh?" Gohan pondered
&lt;He has the same Ki I do!!&gt;

<P>The other Gohan then began a very familiar attack,
"Ka..."

<P>"What the!?"
Gohan stared on as the imposter continued his attack.

<P>"Me..."
"Ha... Me..."

<P>Gohan quickly ducked out of the way as fast as he could!

<P>"HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
The beam of blue light just missed Gohan tearing his shirt.

<P>Gohan rolled on to the floor and quickly arose.

<P>"Hmmm..." The imposter said.
"Ha..."
"Ha ha hahaha!" The evil Gohan began laughing like a maniac.

<P>"Hahahahaha!"

<P>"Stop it" Gohan finally said.

<P>"Ahahahaha!"

<P>"STOP IT!!"
Gohan felt a sudden surge of power within himself.
"Buuuaaaaaaaaaa!!!"

<P>The evil Gohan looked on smiling as if he were pleased with what he saw.

<P>"YaaaaaaaaaYAYAYAaaaaaaa"
Gohan's hair was a bright display of yellow and black glowing!

<P>"AHAAAYAAAAYAYAAAAAA....." Gohan finally stopped...
He had gold hair and green eyes!
Was it true?
Was Gohan really a Super Saiya Jin!!?

<P>Unfortunately Gohan was as surprised as you are!

<P>"Hmmm..." The evil Gohan pondered.
"I would probably suppose you are now wondering why you are a Super Saiya 
Jin"

<P>"hahaha!"
"And I bet you don't even know where you are!"

<P>"TELL ME" said Gohan through clenched teeth.

<P>"Well if you must insist!"
The other Gohan turned SSJ with ease and punched Gohan in the face!

<P>"YOUR IN MY WORLD!" Laughed the evil Gohan.

<P>Gohan stuttered backward and spoke through clenched teeth again...
"WHAT?"

<P>"Ha hahaha!"
"Your in my NET!" laughed the Evil Gohan again.

<P>"EXPLAIN!!!" Gohan screamed louder.
"AhYAAAaaaa!"

<P>While Gohan was still fascinated by the story Evil Gohan kicked him in the 
head!

<P>"DON'T BE SUCH AN IDIOT!" Evil Gohan screamed.
"Your power will never match mine!"

<P>Evil Gohan gave him another punch to the face and continued the story...
"Well for you information my name is Brix!"
"And if you must know I created this place"

<P>"Huh?" Gohan stuttered.

<P>Brix gave him a small Ki blast that Gohan quickly dodged.
"LET ME FINISH!!!"

<P>"The reason you are a Super Saiya Jin is because you think you are."

<P>&lt;What does he mean?&gt; Gohan said to himself knowing better than to say it out 
loud.

<P>"IT MEANS that you just imagined going SSJ, you never did though!"

<P>&lt;Huh?&gt;

<P>"That's right, I can read you mind Gohan!"
"The belt you received from you teacher helped me tap into your mind!"
"I control what you see, hear, feel, EVERYTHING!"

<P>Gohan gasped.

<P>Brix took this opportunity to kick him in the face again.

<P>"Yes, and I let you believe you became a Super Saiya Jin while
your nothing but a puny piece of garbage!"

<P>Gohan filled with anger and sent two energy blasts
sky rocketing strait for Brix.

<P>Brix caught them in midstream and sent them flying back at Gohan in little 
pieces.

<P>But Gohan dodged every one.
"That... that's impossible!"

<P>"It's MY world and MY rules!" Snickered Brix.

<P>"Then is this YOUR REAL power!"

<P>"No... I'm JUST HAVING FUN WITH YOU!" He laughed.
"And you probably still think this is my true form!"
"Ahahahaha!"

<P>Gohan was getting angry.
&lt;Why does he want me?&gt;

<P>Brix punched Gohan into the floor and stood on top of him...
"The reason I picked you was because I could only tap into the mind of a 
child!"
"And since you were the only child I've come across in my long years
imprisoned in that belt, I decided you were the perfect playmate!"

<P>Gohan grabbed his leg and swung him into a wall.

<P>"I forgot you could read my mind..."
"But it's going to take more than that to bring me down Brix!!"
