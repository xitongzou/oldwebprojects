<p>
"Zorn didn't tell us exactly where or when this is, just that we're
both on-planet right now," mused Chishan, elite Saiyan and second son
of General Nappa's large family, as he followed Apio down the narrow,
crowded street. Slave creatures of many races scurried about, buying
and selling and otherwise doing their masters' bidding.  Proud Saiyan
warriors clad in battle armor strode down the street, heedless of the
slaves who scurried frantically out of their way. "Where are you
going, anyway?"
<p>
Apio, a big, broad, plain-faced Saiyan with black spiky hair flowing
down to his hips, glanced at his older brother. "Tracking the broo."
<p>
Chishan looked startled, and tilted his head as if listening,
highlighting the short, vivid scar across his left eye. He was slimmer
than his blocky younger brother, but still powerfully built; hair
spilled down to just below his shoulderblades in a spray of black
spikes. "Oh. Yeah. That reek is hard to miss!"
<p>
Apio snorted. "Thought you were smelling this alley?"
<p>
Chishan smiled wryly. "Yeah. Seeing and hearing all this again, I
forgot I was dead for a moment."

<p>Apio raised one eyebrow and shook his head reproachfully, then
turned back to the task at hand. "Only two of them."

<p>
"Two of us, two of them. Could get nasty."
<p>
"Probably will."
<p>
"I know where we are now," Chishan said. "We're on the edge of the
Slave Quarter, and over that way is the spaceport. Welcome to
Vegetasai, and all that," he commented sardonically.
<p>
"Nice neighborhood," Apio grunted as the streets narrowed and
darkened. Ancient Tsufuru-built buildings towered above them, much
repaired and rebuilt over the centuries. Furtive creatures ducked in
and out of buildings, avoiding clusters of ragged, savage-looking
Saiyans that idled near taverns, pawnshops and gambling houses.
<p>
There were more slaves in this district, and fewer Saiyans, but the
Saiyans of the Slave Quarter were the weakest, poorest and most bitter
of the race.  They were those too weak to enlist in the off-world
soldiery, or too cowardly, or too damaged by past injuries, physical
and mental. Despised and unwanted--for what good is a Saiyan who
cannot fight?--they lived among and preyed on those too weak to resist
them, the common slaves of the Quarter.
<p>
"You know your way well enough, 'Shan," said Apio.
<p>
"Yeah, I used to come down this way for a little entertainment, to
wind down after purge missions. The broo came this way, too. My guess
is they're looking for someone with a weak mind and strong body--oh,
crud!"
<p>
The two ghosts glanced at each other; Apio hissed wordlessly and said,
"They split up."
<p>
"One stayed here in the Quarter, but the other went flying off over
there... I wonder what got his attention?"
<p>
"Medical Center," Apio grunted.
<p>
"Yeah, that makes sense. Another source of strong bodies and weak
minds--the wounded in the regen tanks. If there's some wounded
first-class whose soul and body are held together by a thread...."

<p>"...Broo-boy kicks that soul out and moves himself in," growled
Apio.  "I'll take him--you go after the bottomfeeder. Meet at the
tavern--you know the one--when you're done."

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
In the sparring pit, Cumber looked askance at the stocky, bearded
alien doctor who was supervising the two medical technicians as they
carefully lifted Berge's body onto a gurney. "I don't see why you're
bothering... with those bone shards driven into his brain, he's dead."
<p>
"Brain damage is unpredictable," the doctor answered calmly. "We'll
see what happens after the tissue is regenerated. He may be braindead,
he may be permanently impaired, or he may come out of this in perfect
health."
<p>
Cumber shrugged, and let the medics carry on with their work.  The
elite had no particular animus against Berge--in fact, they had been
friends, but he did think Berge had been a damn fool to get in a
sparring match with Rhubra--and doubly a fool to fight so carelessly,
preening like an adolescent before the elite woman! Well, he'd paid
the price. Too bad for Berge that Rhubra was already involved and had
no interest in courting displays. Doubly bad for Berge that Rhubra was
involved with Cumber.
<p>
"I hope you're satisfied," he hissed down at his corpse-faced
friend. "I tried to warn you that she wouldn't be admiring your
physique once the fight started--she'd be trying to kill you.  You
just didn't listen, did you?"
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
No-Tail winced as he dragged himself and his maimed leg deeper into
the old sewer pipe. Damn the bastards! He'd cornered the old slave in
an empty alley and made the kill himself, Rateater and his cronies had
no right to take his meat away! He'd been a fool to fight them, but
his empty stomach maddened him, drove him out of his head with
hunger. Unable to bear losing his first real meal in a week, he'd
attacked Rateater himself, grabbing his tail and not letting go--until
the others had beaten him nearly senseless.
<p>
Pain drove the hunger madness from his brain, and left him cowering in
his usual fear--he'd broken free and run, then. Not that he could run
very far; something was wrong with his knee, and his ankle was
broken--it was only a matter of time before Rateater finished his
feast and came after him.  Then No-Tail himself would become
Rateater's kill and next feast.
<p>
As he shivered fearfully in his hiding place deep in the Slave Quarter
sewers, the small, tailless, cowardly, weak-willed Saiyan did not
sense the foul presence that drifted toward him like an intangible
poisonous mist until it was far, far too late.
<p>

<p>
The medical technician frowned at the outputs from Berge's regen tank
and shook his head. "I think we can pull the plug on this one--he's a
flatliner."
<p>
PIP! The encephalograph suddenly burst into activity.
<p>
"What the--? That's impossible!" The technician stared at the formerly
empty graph; it was fully active--but completely wrong.  Quickly, the
technician pulled up Berge's charts and compared them.  The restored
neural activity was completely different from that previous
recorded--it was the graph of a different person. Quickly, the
technician made a copy of the records and went to find Dr. Quoon.
<p>
Some time later, he returned with the skeptical Dr. Quoon.
<p>
"... Are you sure? Brain tissue regeneration is very unpredictable; it
could have affected his brain pattern. Perhaps it's simply been
misfiled in the database."
<p>
"No, sir, I double-checked, and...." the technician's voice trailed
off as he stared at the readings from Berge's regen tank.  "Sir,
something is <i>wrong</i> here! These readings are all wrong for a Saiyan
warrior!"
<p>
The bearded humanoid alien doctor glanced at the
displays. "Extraordinary! The tissue regeneration pattern has
changed... let me see."  Dr. Quoon stepped up to the tank, peering
through the greenish fluid at the man within.
<p>
Two dark eyes regarded him from a face that was no longer Saiyan. A
long-nailed hand reached up and pulled the mask from its face.
<p>
"What?" The doctor staggered back---
<p>
CRASH! The front of the tank exploded in a burst of power, shredding
the doctor into bloody gobbets from the waist up. The technician
cowered behind the console as something that was almost Saiyan, and a
lot something else pulled itself from the remains of the tank. Sharp
claws tipped the otherwise still-Saiyan foot that supported its
owner's weight as it climbed down.  It still had the spiky black hair
of a Saiyan, and the muscular physique of an elite, and even a
tail--though no Saiyan's tail was sheathed in sharp-ridged scales--but
the face! Massive ram's horns curled back from the ex-Saiyan's
temples, and far too many sharp teeth were bared in grinning, bestial
jaws.
<p>
Dark eyes darted toward the cowering technician; with a single bound
the naked creature landed in front of the small birdlike alien. A blow
of his powerful fist slammed the helpless technician to the ground;
then the naked ex-Saiyan knelt on his body and gripped the small
alien's head in both hands.
<p>
The technician screamed and clawed frantically at the ground as a foul
presence forced itself into his mind and rummaged through what it
found there.
<p>
"Coo!" it said. "You've nothing useful to me--I've already got the
language and customs and stuff from Dead-Brain here, and with my
gifts, I don't need your healer's arts." It laughed, a deep growling
rumble. "Besides, I like hurting healers."
<p>
The technician screamed even more as the Saiyan Broo tied crude
tourniquets around both of his arms and both of his legs--and then
ripped them off one by one. It ate what was left, without bothering to
kill him first.

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Even if he hadn't tracked the broo's foul spirit to this spot, Chishan
reflected, the goat horns sprouting from the tailless Saiyan's
head would have caught his attention.  It was a very unusual feature
even for an ex-soldier who'd had his tail cut for cowardice. Chishan
didn't know the man called No-Tail, but there was no mistaking the
brand of disgrace seared into the spot where his tail had been.
<p>
From the look of him, he was starving and had been badly beaten not
too long ago; Chishan marvelled that he could move at all, let alone
so purposefully.  That had to be the broo spirit's doing; it had
possessed the man, suppressing or expelling whatever weak excuse for a
personality he'd had, and was using his body for its own purposes.
<p>
Chishan scowled ferociously and stalked the goat broo-Saiyan,
contemplating how he might interfere with those purposes, whatever
they were. Could he attack the possessing spirit directly?
<p>
As the goat-broo Saiyan-thing slunk up the back stairs of a tenement
building, Chishan drew his spirit sword and slashed savagely across
the thing's back.
<p>
His sword rebounded, and the creature whirled, snarling, hands curled
into claws ready to strike. The broo was in complete possession of
its body and could not be forced out--the former owner's soul was
gone. Something shielded the possessing spirit; it was weaker than
Chishan, and should have lost power to the angry ghost.
<p>
The goat-horned Saiyan looked around and stamped a hoofed foot. It
waggled two fingers, holding them out, pointed approximately at
Chishan. "Strong ghost, strong ghost. Ghost stay away from Gutclaw,
Gutclaw's magic stronger.  Later, later, Gutclaw bind you, drink your
power."
<p>
Chishan recoiled. Shaman! The goat-thing was a shaman, and knew how to
fight and bind spirits. He watched as the thing slipped into the
ancient tenement and followed at a distance, snarling with
anger. Gutclaw meant to feed his hunger-weakened body by hunting
slaves <i>inside</i> the tenement!
<p>
There was a reason the weakest of the Saiyans gathered in gangs on the
streets, and hunted lone slaves in the alleys and byways--but never
set one foot inside a slave tenement.  Someone owned those tenement
buildings, and the slaves within--and that someone was usually an
elite noble or a powerful first-class warrior. An occasional unskilled
or useless slave taken on the street was no real loss, but the slave
owners took it amiss if gutter scum came into <i>their</i> buildings to
prey on <i>their</i> slaves. The weakest of the weak last-class Saiyans had
the courage and strength to hunt feeble, lone slaves in packs--one
first-class in a bad mood could wipe the entire Quarter clean of their
packs and think it no more than an hour's light exercise.
<p>
It didn't take Gutclaw long to find an occupied apartment. As he
drifted insubstantially through walls after the broo shaman, Chishan
was surprised at his own outrage--hadn't he done the same during every
purge? The meat of the young was the tenderest eating, and as for the
female... Bloodlust stimulated lesser lusts, and when the targets
weren't tough enough to provide a good fight, sometimes he indulged
his other lusts when the killing frenzy ran down. Chishan preferred to
sate his lusts on something a bit more <i>Saiyan</i>-looking, but he'd
never cared if his alien victims were willing beforehand or healthy
afterwards.  What did it matter? They'd all be purged anyway.
<p>
Would you have cared if that had been your little sister Zukini? A
part of him asked sarcastically. Imagine she'd been Zarbon or
Doddoria's plaything before she died--would you still think it didn't
matter?
<p>
Shut up! Chishan told himself, just shut the hell up! I don't have
time for this, and I don't want to think about it!

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Apio had even less luck than Chishan. Oh, he'd had no trouble finding
the carnage left in the medical center--it was the center of a crowd
of shocked, confused technicians and warriors milling about and
staring at the seared and blasted wreckage of what had been a regen
tank and most of the adjoining room.  The author of the carnage was
nowhere to be found.
<p>
Three entities were unaccounted for: one technician, one doctor, and
one brain-injured warrior.  One of the living warriors speculated that
something had malfunctioned badly, causing the tank to explode--a
speculation that sent the alien technicians scurrying for cover, lest
one of them be held responsible by the angry, uncertain warriors.
<p>
Apio thought differently; he knew what he was hunting. The missing,
brain-injured warrior--<i>he</i> would have been perfect for the broo
spirit to possess! If the broo were rational, it would also have been
an obvious move to blast the whole place and destroy the evidence. Now
if only he could get one of these idiots to mention who the warrior
was and where he lived!
<p>

<p>
Cumber not only knew where Berge lived, he passed his quarters several
times a day, on his way to meals or his duty station or the sparring
pits. As he passed by, Cumber was surprised to note a light on in
Berge's quarters. His eyes narrowed; could Berge have recovered that
quickly--or was some jackal robbing his suite? Cumber clicked on
his scouter; power level 1950. That was high, but consistant with
Berge having recovered from his deadly wound.
<p>
Cumber slapped the door a few times; as soon as it slid open, he
entered. No one greeted him in the anteroom, but there were sounds
from the sleeping chamber. "Hey, Berge! Why didn't you tell me you
were better?"
<p>
"Just a minute and I'll be out," came Berge's voice from
the other room. "Get comfortable; there's some fresh meat on the
table."
<p>
Cumber wandered into the common room and noted the still-warm,
raw meat on a platter on the table.  He hooked a low chair with his
foot and pulled it under him; sitting down, he picked up a bloody
chunk of liver and slurped it down. "Not bad! Where'd you get it?"
<p>
"The medical center," growled Berge's voice. Cumber looked up,
slightly startled.
<p>
It was not Berge, though it was wearing Berge's armor and scouter, and
had Berge's shoulder-long hair and voice. Berge didn't have horns and
long jaws filled with sharp teeth, and he didn't have a scaly, ridged
tail that whipped from one side to the other. Cumber started to his
feet--
<p>
The thing was already moving, and slammed a fist into Cumber's
unguarded gut.  Cumber doubled up, groaning--only to be interrupted by
a kick in the groin, followed by a heavy blow to back of the helpless
Cumber's head.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
The first thing Cumber was aware of as he regained consciousness was
the pain--pulsing, agonizing pain near the end of his tail.  With a
great effort he managed to turn his head, and blinked, trying to clear
the tears of pain from his eyes.  As his vision cleared, Cumber
realized he was tied face-down, naked and spreadeagle, to Berge's
table.  He couldn't fight, he couldn't get up, he could barely move
his fingers--the pain was everything, weakening him, and clouding his
mind.
<p>
"What?" he gasped.
<p>
A shadow moved into his sight; the Berge-thing looked at him.  "You
are useful to me," it informed him.  "but I need to prepare you
first. I wasn't sure I could restrain something as strong as you, but
then I remembered your tail." The monster roughly pulled the end of
Cumber's tail into view, displaying the large alligator clamp that
firmly gripped Cumber's tail. It laughed harshly. "Such a simple way
to bind a mighty warrior!"
<p>
Cumber shouted curses and heaved at the wires binding him, but with
the clamp on his tail, he didn't have the strength to break the steel
rope or the table. He sagged down, panting with exhaustion.
<p>
"You're too damn loud, Cumber," said the monster. Cumber felt a sharp
prickle of ki, and a cool breeze across the back of his head as some
of his hair fell away.  The monster laughed at the startled look on
his face. "Oh yes, I know your name; I know everything Berge knew.  In
a few hours, I'll know everything you know."
<p>
"You're not Berge!" Cumber snarled.
<p>
"No; Berge is dead. Call me Redjack." With that, the broo-Saiyan
stuffed a handful of Cumber's own hair into his mouth and gagged him.
"Well, <i>think</i> of me as Redjack."  Redjack began to strip off his
armor. "What a fine, proud, tough elite warrior you are! It should
take no more than four hours to break you."
<p>
It only took two hours; two hours in which Cumber learned that the
Saiyans were mere infants in the art of cruelty, two hours in which
Cumber learned of every depravity that one being can inflict on
another, two hours that ended with Redjack pulling himself off of
Cumber's bloody, twitching body for the last time.
<p>
Redjack grinned down at his victim; Cumber's eyes stared up at him,
dull and empty and hopeless.  The tail had been the breaking point; it
hadn't taken very long after Redjack began patiently and
systematically applying his skills to the delicate limb. He hadn't
really needed to abuse the Saiyan again after his victim surrendered
to despair, but the broo enjoyed it <i>so</i> much.
<p>
Cumber didn't even blink as Redjack drew the silver wire tight between
his hands and wrapped it around the Saiyan's throat.  Cumber's body
reacted, shuddering as the wire bit into his neck, but he had no
strength left to resist--nor any desire to do so.  There was something
like relief in the tortured Saiyan's eyes as the garotte slashed
through the big veins and arteries, cutting Cumber's throat; Redjack
couldn't help laughing. As he pulled the wire tight and tensed for the
final twist that would sever Cumber's spine, he whispered in the dying
Saiyan's ear: "This is just the beginning!"
<p>
The final twist and jerk, a breath of diabolical black sorcery, and
Redjack held up Cumber's severed head. The broo laughed, an uproarous
fit that brought tears of mirth streaming from his eyes as Cumber
opened his eyes and screamed soundlessly--his mind and soul now
trapped in his own severed head.
<p>
Redjack, Doom Priest of Thanatar, stroked his new head fondly. It
wasn't the Saiyan's knowledge he wanted--that was trivial, and
differed little from the memories in Berge's brain--but the elite's
raw power.  The black magic that gave Cumber's head a semblance of
life could not be imposed until the Saiyan's will had been completely
broken and his mind as thoroughly <i>known</i> as his quivering
body. Now, as long as his head continued in its half-life, his mind
and power were Redjack's, to use as the broo desired while Cumber
endured, fully conscious, unable to sleep, unable to deny Redjack
utter and complete intimacy with his mind and his soul's innermost
secrets.

<p>Redjack grinned; what was this?  Cumber did have some tidbit of
knowledge that interested him. "Coo! Rhubra." He rolled the name
around on his tongue as he secured the severed head to his waist by
its own hair, savoring Cumber's own desire for the female. Berge had
desired her, too. "Rhubra. Yesss... I shall make her mine."

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Back in the Slave Quarter, Chishan watched the broo-Saiyan Gutclaw
methodically work his way through two more slave apartments, raping,
killing and eating the inhabitants in each one.  The broo was
cautious, sneaking furtively from one hall to the next, avoiding the
sight of any other tenement dwellers. The demon holed up in the last
apartment and curled up to sleep.
<p>
He's not very strong yet, Chishan realized--but a feast like that
should put some meat on his scrawny bones and heal his injuries. In
the ordinary course of things, he'd be doomed; once the owner of these
slaves finds out how many he's lost, he'll wipe out every tailless,
last-class gutter Saiyan in the Quarter.  As it is--he's doomed with
the rest of us. Either he knows that, or he doesn't--but either way,
his actions are foolish... or is he up to something I don't know
about?
<p>
Chishan pondered this for a bit while the broo slept, and finally gave
up in disgust. I can't figure this out without knowing more, and I
can't doing anything about it even if I knew what he was up to. The
ghostly Saiyan snarled his frustration, but only another spirit could
have heard. There must be some way to solve this!

<p><I>"I don't know if you'll be ghosts like if you'd been sent to the
living world the normal way, or manifested like you are here, or
possessing your former selves, or what..." Captain Zorn had said.
</I></p>
<p>
Possessing his former self? Could he do that--take over his own body?
Chishan wondered. Something told him it would either be extremely
easy, or completely impossible. But even if he did, what would it do
to have the same soul twice in one body?
<p>
First he had to find his body... but there was only one day he'd been
on planet shortly before the destruction of Vegetasai--the day he'd
come back from his last purge mission... the last day <i>anyone</i> came
back from a purge mission. Ap had also gotten back a few hours after
him, but right now, if it really was that day, Chishan knew where he
was and what he was doing.

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Chishan woke abruptly, oddly disoriented. Where was he? The two warm
bodies laying against him reminded him; he grinned as he gently
caressed the two naked, sleeping women.  Yamra and Millette were his
two favorites on the whole Street of Whores--if he'd been a low-class
soldier instead of a noble elite, he'd have married both of them by
now.  Unfortunately for them, even though they were Saiyan, they were
too low-class for any kind of permanent liason with <i>Lord</i>
Chishan, eldest living son of the Marshal of Vegetasai.
<p>
Chishan raised himself on one elbow to peer at the third figure
sharing the bed with him. The alien girl was curled up in a tight,
huddled ball, facing away from him, on the very edge of the mat--as
far away as she could get without leaving the sleeping mat entirely.
She shuddered as Chishan reached over Millette to lightly stroke one
pastel green arm.  So, the girl was still awake!  Chishan smiled with
amusement; she had been a rare treat!
<p>
Yamra had hinted that she had something special for him--a new slave
of a very Saiyan-like race, not yet broken in.  Yamra knew his tastes
very well. The girl's pastel green skin, dark green hair and short,
bushy, silver-furred tail had been exotic and intriguing, rather than
disgustingly alien. Her screams and sobs and struggles had inflamed
him until he'd lost himself in his wild passion--he'd come close to
killing her before Yamra and Millette intervened. They had tackled him
and twined their tails around his, demanding that Chishan share his
passion with them--a very dangerous thing to do; he'd nearly killed
all three of them, but it <i>did</i> snap him out of his battle lust.
<p>
After that, they had thoroughly enjoyed the encounter, even if the
little green slave girl hadn't.  So what? She was just a slave--
<p>
An image flashed through Chishan's mind unbidden:

<p><I>His little sister Zukini, stripped naked and pinned to
the metal deck of a starship compartment by two of Frieza's
soldiers. A burly, stub-horned, half-naked soldier was on her; she screamed
thinly as he raped her. Zarbon and Doddoria stood by and watched,
breathing heavily.
</I></p>
<p><I>"Listen to the little monkey squeal," Doddora said, grinning. "I don't think it's enjoying our fun!"
</I></p>
<p><I>Zarbon chuckled. "It's just a filthy monkey--but if you don't
mind, I'll go next.  It'll be all used up by the time you're through."
</I></p>
<p>
Chishan sat all the way up, sweat beading his brow. That never
happened! Zukini and all the rest died in the explosion, they were
never captured, they--
<p>
<i>We're all dead</i>. I'm dead, this is the past, and there's a damn broo
that needs killing! Chishan scrambled to his feet, pulling himself
free from the sleepy embraces of the two Saiyan whores.  Damn it,
where was his armor?--oh, there where he'd dropped it, along with his
scouter.
<p>
As he was pulling his torso armor on, Yamra sat up, rubbing the sleep
out of her eyes. "Hey, what's your hurry? You paid in advance," she
joked. "No need to run out before breakfast..." She glanced at a
chronometer, '...or lunch."
<p>
"There's a demon butchering his way through one of the slave tenements
not too far away. I need to kill him," Chishan said tersely as he
fitted his scouter over his ear.
<p>
Yamra's eyes widened. "Well! Talk about mood spoilers!" She scrambled
out of bed, wincing as she stood up.  "Just as well; you were, ah,
more than I could handle last night. It's going to be a day or two
before I can work again; I should charge you extra for the down time,"
she grumbled, but not seriously.
<p>
Something like Chisan's conscience twinged; she wouldn't have another
day to rest--none of them would. He tossed her a credit plaque.
<p>
"Hey! I was just joking about the extra charge--you know my sense of
humor," Yamra said, fear creeping into her voice. Had she insulted her
elite patron? Chishan was easy-going as elites went, and she thought
he knew her humor and she knew his or she wouldn't have dared say
something so familiar, and every warrior liked to be told he was too
virile for one woman to handle, and--
<p>
The scar-faced warrior seized the younger whore by one arm and pulled
her close, stilling her fears with a deep, passionate kiss. In spite
of her aches and fears, she found herself responding, returning the
passion in his kiss. After long minutes, they pulled apart, breathing
heavily.
<p>
Desultory clapping greeted them from the sleeping mat. Millette, the
older of the two sisters, was awake. "Is this a private party, or can
the rest of us join in?"
<p>
Chishan's lips quirked up in the barest hint of a smile as he wrapped
his right hand around the credit plaque in Yamra's hand.  "Millette,
Yamra... take this, and enjoy yourselves. Buy a feast, go shopping,
whatever--I order you to indulge yourselves totally. Spend it all, if
you can. And..." He glanced at the alien girl huddled on the edge of
the sleeping mat, "take <i>good</i> care of her. I was rough on her last
night."  He gave Yamra one last pat on the rump, and was out the door
and gone.
<p>
Yamra blinked and stared after the departed warrior, her tail tip
twitching. "What was that all about?"
<p>
Millette yawned. "I dunno, but I'm not going to complain. How many
credits in that account, anyway?"
<p>
Yamra's eyebrows raised. "I'm almost afraid to find out. That was
weird--have you ever known 'Shan to give a damn about a slave?"
<p>
Millette frowned. "Never... he nearly killed her last night! You know
how much Dendretta cost me--Saiyan-like virgin females in good health
are not cheap, damn it! I knew she'd be to 'Shan's taste, and I
figured he'd be perfect to break her in, and he gets off to a good
start and then goes battle-happy on me, and I nearly get killed
snapping him out of it, damn it!"  Millette grumbled. "Then this
morning..." She shakes her head. "Damn it! He worries me, Yam; I've
seen other warriors act like that."  She stood up, still frowning, and
opened a wall locker looking for clothes. "'Shan thinks he's going to
die soon, damn it."
<p>
Yamra sat up, alarmed. "Not 'Shan! I like him! Besides, he's Nappa's
son--no one is strong enough!"
<p>
Millette sighed. "Yeah, well, I remember another one of Nappa's sons
who was every bit as strong, and he's every bit dead now. Every
warrior I knew who thought he was going to die was right, damn it!
But... maybe I'm reading him wrong--'Shan didn't actually say it
himself. Damn it, he's our best customer, and he treats us well--he's
more like a second- or third-class than an elite when it comes to
that."
<p>
Yamra chuckled.  "You like him, too, big sister--you just don't want
to admit it! Well, if 'Shan really thinks he's going to die, shouldn't
we respect his last request?" Yamra held up the credit plaque
hesitantly.
<p>
Millette smirked and snatched the plaque from Yamra. "Yam, honey,
that's one elite lord's order I'll be happy to obey."

<p>
How long had he been out of it? Chishan had possessed his own sleeping
body--and had promptly fallen asleep. He'd forgotten that a soul in a
body was subject to the limitations of the body--and his body and mind
were asleep, so he slept. Not only that, his soul and mind and
memories had gotten all tangled up, and he'd temporarily forgotten
that he was here twice, and had a mission to accomplish....

<p><I>Captain Zorn was a slender Saiyan with a wild shock of short black
hair drooping into his eyes and every other direction as well; like
the rest of the Saiyan warriors in Hell, he'd kept his form and most
of his power. "I need two elite warriors to take care of a, ah, small
problem that this battle has caused." The pointed sarcasm in Zorn's
voice caught Chishan's ear; he stirred uneasily.
</I></p>
<p><I>
"How small a problem?" asked the scar-faced elite.
</I></p>
<p><I>"The battle with Chaos tore holes in reality, and broo escaped
through those holes. There's one in particular that has to be closed
fast, but not before we kill the broo."
</I></p>
<p><I>
Chishan glanced at Apio, and asked suspiciously, "Why us? And what's
so special about this hole, Zorn? You're never close-mouthed
unless it's bad."
</I></p>
<p><I>
Zorn sighed. "I picked you two because you're powerful, and you're not
stupid, and I can trust you to stick to the job and not get
distracted. The hole is a time gate, Chishan... a gate to Vegetasai
before it.... before we died."
</I></p>
<p><I>
"Oh, crud." Chishan stared at Zorn. "How can you trust even us? Any of
us would do anything to change what happened!"
</I></p>
<p><I>
Apio finally spoke. "It's not that simple--we can't change
anything, can we?"
</I></p>
<p><I>Zorn lowered his voice. "You can't change anything--you're still
dead, and past time is fixed. The broo can, if they possess a body.
It is said that they can change the unchangeable, for that is the
nature of Chaos--unlimited change."
</I></p>
<p><I>
"Would that be so bad, if it changed things so that Frieza didn't
destroy Vegetasai?" Chishan wondered.
</I></p>
<p><I>Zorn looked at him reproachfully; Chishan was usually smarter than
that. "Chishan--"
</I></p>
<p><I>
Apio interrupted. "'Shan, can you imagine a broo doing something
helpful... ever?"
</I></p>
<p><I>
Chishan scowled. "No. But I don't see how they can possibly make
things worse." He shrugged. "We're all dead, what does it matter if
the demons send a few people here early?"
</I></p>
<p><I>
Zorn frowned. "When you're done thinking up excuses for staying in
Hell and not going back home, let me know."
</I></p>
<p><I>
Chishan scratched the back of his head. "Eh, that's a hard way to put
it. We'll do it," He glanced quickly at Apio for confirmation.
</I></p>
<p><I>"One more thing," Zorn lowered his voice, "at that time, there is
no one alive stronger than Frieza. Those who killed Frieza were all
young and vulnerable then. No one except Frieza himself could change
what Frieza did to us; you can't stop Frieza, but anyone could kill
Kakarott or Vegeta's mate-to-be, whoever she is. Even young Vegeta
might be vulnerable, and Raditz definitely is. You know what that
would mean."
</I></p>
<p>
...Yeah, Chishan knew what that meant: if Raditz hadn't gone to Earth
and killed Kakarott, letting him be resurrected so much the stronger, or if
Kakarott had never made it to Earth, Frieza would never have been
defeated and the last of the Saiyans would have died a miserable death
as Frieza's broken slaves. Instead, the last of the Saiyans had died
fighting as warriors should, and some of them had been miraculously
resurrected. There wasn't supposed to be hope in Hell, and Chishan had
no hope for himself... but maybe, just maybe because of Kakarott and
Vegeta there was some tiny hope for the Saiyan race.
<p>
Chishan would take on all Hell and Vegetasai both before he let some
lousy, stinking <i>demon</i> destroy that tiny hope.
<p>
Time to find that little bastard before he got up to <i>real</i>
mischief. He tapped the scouter on as he flew down the alley toward
the tenement building, searching for anomalous power readings. Nothing
high enough to even threaten a third-class. Chishan frowned; Gutclaw
had seemed moderately powerful as a spirit. Where was he?
<p>
Below him, a dark shape suddenly caught his eye. Chishan looked at it,
but there was no reading on his scouter. Just some stray bit of trash,
or--?
<p>
It was a body.  Chishan touched down and turned over the carcass with
one toe--to his surprise, it was one of the gutter Saiyans. Why hadn't
he realized that at first--oh. His tail had been cut off. Chishan
knelt down and inspected the body more closely, noting other
mutilations; the dead man had been de-tailed and sloppily tortured to
death. Or maybe it hadn't been sloppy; true torture strove to keep the
victim alive as long as possible--the killer seemed bent on
inflicting a very painful death quickly. Chishan shuddered and
wrapped his tail more tightly around his waist.
<p>
There were many hazards in the Slave Quarter, not least of which were
other gutter Saiyans, who did not hesitate to kill and eat anyone
weaker and slower than they. Nonetheless, Chishan could not ignore the
synchronicity between the arrival of the broo and this strange, brutal
murder.  Besides, no gutter Saiyan would have left perfectly good meat
behind.
<p>
Chishan extended one hand and power flared in a long plume that
completely consumed the corpse, and continued his search. He paused to
dispose of two more corpses, similarily mutilated and
de-tailed--Gutclaw had been busy, but what did he want with the tails?
<p>
The apartment was empty. After finding the bodies along the way,
Chishan had expected that it would be. Where was the little bastard
now? Again he searched for anomalous readings--there! That was far too
high for a gutter Saiyan, and the wrong part of the Quarter for a
second-class.  Second-class? If that was Gutclaw, his power had grown
drastically.
<p>
Chishan blew out the wall and flashed through the air, heedless of who
saw him or whose property he might have damaged. He was the son of
Nappa--few Saiyans and no aliens would dare call him to account even
if they had had more than a day to live.

<p>
Rateater was the strongest of the gutter Saiyans, which wasn't saying
much, but he was strong enough to dominate the Slave Quarter aliens
and gutter Saiyans alike. He could have been a third-class warrior and
gone off-planet except for one thing: he was completely psychotic.  He
was too unpredictable, too apt to scream at things no one else could
see, too likely to start foaming and clawing at the invisible bugs
eating his brain, too fond of attacking and killing the random
passers-by who were stalking him and <i>plotting</i> to put bugs in his
brain; no team would accept him nor would any recruiter train him.
With the odd cunning of madness he refrained from attacking anyone
significantly more powerful than he, and, since his victims were
nothing but slaves and weaklings, no warrior bothered to put Rateater
out of his misery.
<p>
In his more lucid moments, he was a vicious bully and fierce hunter;
that, combined with his relative strength and unusual appearance--grey
complexion, dark, nearly black tail-fur--attracted fearful respect
from the other gutter Saiyans. Rateater never went hungry for long,
and had never starved; his small band of followers survived quite well
on his leavings.
<p>
Unfortunately for Rateater's gang, No-Tail's hatred for his tormentors
had been remembered by Gutclaw. Rateater came out of one of his
brain-clawing fits to find that his followers had been reduced to one
in the space of several hours--and then none.  They had simply
wandered off and disappeared, which disturbed the unstable, paranoid
Saiyan.
<p>
Then the piping began, <i>greatly</i> disturbing Rateater. He staggered down
the alleyways, shouting at the invisible musician, looking for
something or someone to tear apart. He was completely surprised to
round a corner and find No-Tail standing in the middle of the narrow
alley, waiting for him.
<p>
Rateater blinked; something was funny about No-Tail's face. He
had... horns. The little coward wasn't running, either. Rateater
roared and charged--only to find his feet firmly rooted to the
ground. He fell on his face.
<p>
"Cannot befuddle the fuddled," recited Gutclaw. "A madness
demon... niiiice. I will have him." The broo gestured with his hands,
and something intangible swept over Rateater and crawled in his
head--<i>and ate all the bugs</i>! Rateater sat up, whimpering with his
hands around his head. The bugs were all gone, they weren't crawling
in his head eating his brain anymore, and he could think!
<p>
Gutclaw cocked his head, and looked at Rateater thoughtfully. Rateater
started to notice other things that were not quite right about the
former No-Tail--his feet were changed into hooves, and he had a tail
wrapped around his waist--no, he didn't, he had a braided rope or
something tied around his waist...
<p>
"Stupid, lame little bastard!" the bully Rateater growled as he got to
his feet. "A fake tail! Who you fooling, coward?"
<p>
Gutclaw smirked. "Not a tail, not a fake tail. Real tails, real
tails. I like your tail, too." With that, he danced forward on his
hooves and suddenly snap-kicked, catching Rateater solidly in the
groin. Rateater went down, groaning; Gutclaw kneed him in the face
and chopped the dark-tailed Saiyan across the neck. Rateater stayed
down.
<p>
When Rateater regained his senses, he found himself looking into
Gutclaw's goat-horned, Saiyan face. Gutclaw smirked, and Rateater felt
a sudden, sharp pain at the base of his tail, followed by sudden
weakness.
<p>
"ARRRRGGHHH! What did you--?" Rateater fell suddenly silent as Gutclaw
waved a severed black-furred tail in his face.  "MY TAIL!" he bellowed
in anguish--only to be hit by Gutclaw again, nearly knocking him out.
Then the cutting began...
<p>
Gutclaw smirked in satisfaction as Rateater's tormented soul finally
broke free of his tortured, dying body... only to be trapped in his
own severed tail.  Tail-binding was a foul ritual of pain; Rateater
had been tortured to death in such a way that the pain increased as
death neared; his confused soul had anticipated death as greater
torment rather than the final release it should have been, and so
lingered with his body--or rather, the most coveted part of his body.
<p>
Gutclaw licked his lips; for animals, it was tails, for humans,
the hands, and for Saiyans, also their precious tails. His companion
Redjack would probably argue that the head was a better container for
a captured soul, but that was a Thanatari for you.  Gutclaw had no
interest in mucking about with his victim's minds; he just wanted the
raw power. He carefully braided the black-furred tail in with the
other stolen tails he wore around his waist, savoring the extra ki
he'd captured.  Maybe now he'd have enough to bind that strong ghost
who'd attacked him....
<p>
Thip!
<p>
Gutclaw whirled; another Saiyan had just landed--no gutter Saiyan
this, but a true warrior! The warrior tapped his scouter and scowled,
plainly disliking the numbers he was reading. "What the hell?"
<p>
Gutclaw's nose twitched; he didn't like the power he could sense on
this armored warrior, either.  Even with the boosted ki from the
captured souls, he couldn't hope to challenge a strong
first-class--and this was an elite! His fingers arched in a clutching
gesture, and then released. "Madness demon, feast!"
<p>
Chishan staggered as invisible bugs clawed at his face, trying to
burrow in through his eyes and mouth to devour his soft, juicy brain.
He clawed at his face, trying to get the creatures no one could see
off and away--
<p>
<i>This is a psychic attack, you idiot!</i> Chishan collapsed to his knees
as his strength suddenly left him--and so did the crawling bugs. He
sensed rather dimly that some kind of struggle he couldn't see was
going on around him--and what was he doing here in the back alleys of
the Slave Quarter with a corpse for company? Last he remembered, he
was quite comfortably wrapped up with Yamra and Millette and that
green slave-thing. How had he--?
<p>
His strength returned in a rush; Chishan stood up and brushed himself
off.  The damn broo was nowhere to be seen.  Damn, damn, damn! He
distracted me with that madness demon--I had to abandon my own body to
fight it or it would have possessed me! Snarling viciously, Chishan
tapped his scouter, looking for the goat-broo Saiyan's overly-strong
signature. He caught the last trace of it as it vanished into those of
the swarm of low-class soldiers coming and going on the edge of the
port district.
<p>
Where's he going now?  Chishan thought with some irritation. He's not
inconspicuous with those horns and that tail belt of his--which raises
his power level somehow. Oh, right. Check that last elevation,
fool--he's in the sewers. But where is he going? What is he after?
Chishan lifted his head up and looked toward the port district, and
the tall buildings of the launch complex...
<p>
A shiver ran the length of Chishan's tail.  No. He couldn't--there's
no way the demon could know.  Even I don't know exactly when--Bardock
only said they passed in flight as he was returning to
Vegetasai... That's hours from now, so he probably hasn't launched
yet; he might even still be in his creche. He's here, right now, and
if that demon <i>is</i> after him--I can't take the risk, Chishan thought
as he rose into the air, his double-strength aura igniting around
him. That broo has the power of a strong second-class, and at his
present age, Kakarott has no chance at all.
<p>

<p>
"What I want is simple," Apio said to the newt-like alien he had
pinned to the wall with his forearm. "Tell me who the missing
warrior is, and where he lives. What is hard about that?"
<p>
"Y-Yes. Right away, master!" the slave clerk gabbled. Apio released
him, and the creature ran to a console and typed hurriedly. "He is
Berge of the Tsufurjiti, assigned to the Palace Guard, and his
quarters are... in the Old Imperial Quadrangle, 5th level, 4th hall,
OQ #37. Sir?"  A breeze swirled the clerk's robes; Apio had already
left.
<p>
It took too long to find my own body, Apio thought. I should have
known what day it was--
<p>
The first place he'd looked was his home, in the house he shared with
Choy. His past, still-living self wasn't there--but Choy was.  Apio
stopped to watch <i>her</i>--his wife, lost to him for three long decades
of eternity. She hadn't been sent to Hell with her stubborn, proud
warrior husband, but had instead been reincarnated somewhere in the
vast universe.  Of all the consequences of his sins, losing her had
been the hardest to bear.
<p>
At first he'd watched only her, admiring her fair, soft skin, the
curve of her lips, the dreamy look in her eyes, the swish of her furry
tail twitching back and forth, the fall of her short, spiky hair, the
glitter of the earrings he'd given her before they married... After a
while, he noticed the meal she was preparing--a welcoming feast, a
fine spread of all kinds of meat and fruit and breads and vegetables
for a hungry warrior coming home.  She's expecting me home from a
mission soon!
<p>
A fine fat samlon caught his eye, dressed and stuffed--I don't
remember this! Fresh samlon is hard to come by, we only had it when
we caught it ourselves...
<p>
He remembered how just the two of them would fly to the highlands to a
particular mountain tarn and feast on the samlon run until they could
barely move, then camp overnight by the tarn. They kept each other
warm through the frigid mountain night, and feasted on samlon
breakfast the next morning.
<p>
She must have flown to the tarn and brought it back for my
homecoming... Ah, Choy!  How could I have forgotten this?
<p>
Sorrow overwhelmed his soul. He knew. I never came home.  Today is the
last day, and I never came home. I was at the tavern when everything
ended. If I had only known...
<p>
CHOY!
<p>
But she, so close, could not hear him. And he, so close, had to leave
to find himself.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Apio scowled down at the headless, mutilated, abused, and partially
eaten corpse tied to the common room table in OQ #37. It could have
belonged to the missing warrior, but Apio doubted it. He was
increasingly confident that the missing warrior and the elusive broo
were one and the same; the mess on the table certainly suggested a
broo at work.
<p>
Apio sniffed the air; the familiar smells of lust, death and pain and
a less familiar, rank smell as of some wild beast hung heavy in the
air. Apio prodded the corpse--still somewhat warm, but starting to
stiffen. Not dead long, but he'd died hard. As he inspected the body,
Apio suddenly realized the bloody, ropy length lying across the
corpse's legs was not a loop of intestine, but his tail--and it had
been <i>skinned</i>.
<p>
Apio leaned against a wall until his stomach stopped lurching. Damn
it, I'm a warrior and a son of Nappa! He thought, angry and embarassed
at his sudden weakness; I've seen worse on a dozen worlds--all the
nasty ways you can die in battle. I've seen Hell. I've <i>done</i> worse--
<p>
No, I haven't. This isn't killing--this is demon work. I hate demons.
I hate coming across their leavings, even in Hell, where the victims
deserve it and can't be killed anyway.
<p>
Why'd he take the head? No sign of it anywhere around; he took it with
him. What does he want the head of an elite warrior for? And who was
this guy?

<p>It didn't take very long to search the elite's quarters and find the
victim's discarded armor and scouter. The scouter's internal registry
indicated that it belonged to one Cumber of the Morjiti. "And he lives
where?" Apio looked up the name in the public database. "Down the next
hall? I'll pay a visit while he's out." Apio glanced at the corpse
with a grimace.  "What a damn waste! Now, or in two hours--what's the
difference?"

<p>
Cumber's quarters were, as Apio had expected, empty of life.  He
hadn't really expected to find the broo here, but it was the only lead
he had. "And now?" Apio thought a bit, then flicked on his scouter,
scanning the building.  A great many of the lower-ranking palace
elites lived in the Old Imperial Quadrangle, and their high power
levels stood out on the scouter.  After a few minutes, Apio
frowned. No anomalously high or low power levels--either the broo had
elite-level power to begin with, or his power was that of the elite
he'd possessed.
<p>
Apio sighed and adjusted his scouter; that left the bad way to find
him. From the looks of the corpse, it had taken Cumber a few hours to
die; if the broo was indulging himself this way again, somewhere in
the building there would be an elite with a fading power....
<p>
It took ten minutes to locate three suspect power levels, and another
fifteen minutes of watching them to single out the one that was
definitely fading, though in fits and starts. Apio changed the focus
and located the fading power--in close proximity to a very powerful
elite. Apio's eyes narrowed; the bastard's power was nearly as high as
his, and twice what the missing Berge's power was supposed to be!
<p>
"What the--?"  The fading power plumetted and cut off abruptly; it was
gone. "Dead already!"  Apio got to his feet and hurried
down the hall from Cumber's quarters; as he did so, another, weaker
power moved into the scouter's field of detection and close to the
very powerful elite. "I don't like this!"

<p>
Redjack pulled himself out of the dead woman with a pleased sigh.
Taking Rhubra's head while he violated her body again made him howl
with pleasure--and the delicious horror as she realized her fate was
re-doubled when Redjack forced her to feel his joy at her utter
degradation.  Oh yes! That was exquisite.
<p>
The exquisite pleasure of her destruction almost made up for the lost
pleasure of keeping her captive and watching his larvae grow and swell
her womb until it was ready to eat its way out... But no, right now he
needed her elite power far more than he needed offspring. His real
target would require all the heads he could get in the next hour or
so--and Redjack had to move fast if he was to catch up with his
target.
<p>
Redjack arose from his victim and started to pull Berge's
armor back on. Whose head would be strong enough to give him that
final boost of power he needed?  King Vegeta was far too closely
guarded and too strong in any case--perhaps the guard captain, or one
of the other senior captains?  If he could catch one off duty...
<p>
"Rhubra? It's me, Cressa! I'm home, training's over for the day!" a
young girl's voice called as the door slid open.  Redjack was just
starting to reach for his two heads when a young Saiyan girl dressed
in battle armor walked in.
<p>
She stopped, mouth open in shock at scene before her. "Rhubra?"
<p>
Yes! Redjack would have offspring after all! As he tackled the girl,
Redjack noted with amusement that Rhubra's eyes also widened in horror
and that her mouth opened in a silent scream of rage.

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
The door vanished in a sudden blast of energy as Apio blurred into the
elite's quarters.  A partially nude half-Saiyan, half-broo thing
crouched over the partially stripped form of a young girl; beyond her,
another headless, mutilated body dripped gore from a low table. Two
severed heads lay on the corpse's abdomen. The broo's massively horned
head whipped around and snarled at Apio--
<p>
--Apio's shoulder caught the thing low in the chest, slamming the
beast through several walls and out the side of the building. As the
creature plummetted toward the ground, Apio sent several ki-blasts
after it, heedless of whoever might be in the way.
<p>
Apio hovered, watching the huge dust cloud and his scouter, and
cursed. The beast had managed to avoid most of his attack, but his
power was oddly low. Apio swore again; the damn thing was hiding part
of its power! He dove in pursuit--
<p>
--only to find himself chasing it back to the dead elite's
quarters. Apio slammed through several more walls, only to just miss
the broo as it fled clutching the two severed heads--and its power was
up again--above even Apio's level!
<p>
"Damn!" The chaos demon was headed for the palace! "He'll have his
hands full there," Apio growled, his aura flaring as he sped after the
broo.
<p>
The broo slowed, and plunged toward the Slave Gate. Apio's eyes
narrowed; the beast picked the area with the weakest, most
inexperienced guards, for guard cadets got their training at the Slave
Gate. "Bastard!"
<p>
With a sudden burst of speed, he got ahead of the creature just as it
landed at the gate. Apio dropped down between the monster and the two
guard cadets at the gate.
<p>
Redjack bared sharp teeth and snarled at the elite; both severed heads
now dangled at his waist by their hair. Apio stepped back; according
the scouter, both severed heads held the power of an elite--and they
were <i>alive</i>. Both heads opened their eyes and stared at him; one, the
woman, opened her mouth in a silent scream. Redjack grinned at Apio.
<p>
"You, there, identify your---WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?" exclaimed the
startled cadet guard. Apio recognized him as young Lord Miso; his
equally startled companion was unknown to him.

<p>"The beast is here to assassinate Prince Vegeta," snarled Apio,
black fury nearly choking him.  "Either kill it, or stay out of my way
while I kill it--and you will address me as <i>Commander</i> Apio, Cadet!"

<p>
Redjack snarled as his plans were laid bare. "If you really are one of
Nappa's petty brats, you have not the power!" He tapped his scouter;
the broo's eyes widened as he registered Apio's power level.

<p>Apio snarled coldly at the disconcerted broo. "Not so weak, demon!
Now--DIE!" Twin ki blasts burst from his hands and streaked toward the
broo--

<p>
--and struck, exploding into another cloud of dust. Apio dove into the
cloud right after his blast, trusting his scouter and his instincts.
<p>
THUD! His fist caught the demon in his currently unarmored groin; the
follow-up kick to its head sent the broo spinning away to crash into
the gatehouse, blood and broken teeth streaming from its nose and
mouth.
<p>
Thip! The demon righted itself and rebounded from the gatehouse, a
huge ki-blast surging from its fingertips to narrowly miss Apio. It
didn't miss the cadets; Lord Miso's companion screamed once, and was
gone. Young Lord Miso sprawled on the ground, burnt and bleeding from
a dozen wounds. Something thundered in the distance and streaked into
the sky behind the palace.
<p>
Apio closed with the demon again; it was ready for him this time. A
flurry of strikes and blocks, feints and counter-feints ensued;
neither landed a signifcant blow on the other. They circled each
other, panting.

<p>Apio wiped a trickle of blood from the corner of his mouth and
smirked.  "You can't win, beast!  See that ship heading into orbit?
The Prince is on that ship; you'll never reach him. If you could, he'd
snuff you out like a blown candle. Stay here--you're doomed."

<p>
The broo's eyes--yellow, predator's eyes--narrowed. "Young Vegeta will
be on Frieza's ship? So..." Redjack hissed, as he searched Berge's
memories and his two captive brains for knowledge of Frieza and space
ships. The broo laughed suddenly. "Thank you so very much--now DIE!"
Redjack's voice rose to a howl as he gestured at Apio and his eyes
turned totally black: "SEVER SPIRIT!"
<p>

<p>
"DAMN IT!" Chishan swore as he checked his scouter for the hundredth
time--Gutclaw was definitely in the complex and heading for the
medical center, and <i>no one</i> seemed to notice! What the hell was
wrong? A final burst of speed, and he touched down on one of the lower
landing platforms, then slammed the nearest door until it opened.  Two
technicians stared at him as he sprinted past.
<p>
The scar-faced elite raced down the stairs toward the medical level;
the readings were getting clearer--the damn thing seemed to be
<i>inside</i> the stairshaft and a great many levels below him. Of course!
Chishan cursed himself for idiocy.  The little bastard was in an air
shaft--no wonder no one noticed him!
<p>
No one would notice him, either, until it was much too late, Chishan
thought grimly. It was up to him to stop the demon.
<p>
No, no, NO! Gutclaw was out of the shaft and on one of the levels--the
creche level, where the infants were! Chishan howled, and power
gathered around him, shaking the spiral stair top to bottom. Shouts
above and below him went unheeded as he blasted a hole through the
side of the stairshaft and plunged down the access duct, blasting away
any pipes or wires that dared obstruct him.
<p>
Two, three warriors blasted through the side of the shaft and tried to
tackle him--Chishan flung them away with brutal, bone-breaking blows,
raging all the while: "Fools! I'm not the one to stop! GET THE
ASSASSIN!"
<p>
Still, they slowed him down--
<p>
--one, two, three tiny powers on the level far below winked
out. Something was killing infants.
<p>
"KAKAROTT!" Chisan screamed.
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Apio shook his head woozily and staggered to his feet as several more
guards rushed up. What the hell hit him? What was he doing here--oh,
right. He was trying to stop an assassin! Apio wasn't too clear on how
he'd stumbled on the bastard, but it didn't matter; his duty was
plain.
<p>
"Commander Apio! What the--?" asked the leading guard.
<p>
Apio coughed and gestured at the guard to wait while he caught his
breath. <i>Something</i> had hurt him badly inside.
<p>
"Assassin," he gasped out, "after the Prince. He'll be after a
single-shuttle, to reach Frieza's ship. Warn the launch bay!"
<p>
The lead guard spoke hurriedly into his communicator; another guard
smirked. "I pity the assassin that annoys Prince Vegeta!"

<p>"You fool!" Apio growled. "The monster has bagged three elites
already! He's got weird powers--" Apio began coughing blood again.

<p>
The second guard's smirk was replaced with sudden concern. "Commander
Apio, you need to get to Medical. We'll handle it from here--"
<p>
The lead guard looked up at Apio, his face pale. "It's too late. The
monster killed two guards and stole a shuttle." They all glanced at
the sky as the royal shuttle thundered into the sky, followed closely
by a small one-man shuttle pod.

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Apio's future spirit seethed with rage--the broo's spell had
forced him from the body of his past self, stunning him. By the time
he'd recovered, the broo and his head collection were on their way
into orbit, beyond Apio's physical reach.  There was no way for he and
his past self to catch up with the speedy one-man shuttle before it
docked with Freiza's ship.
<p>
Once aboard Frieza's ship... the beast didn't have the power to kill
young Vegeta--yet. Possibly Frieza's soldiers would kill the
intruder... <i>but what if the broo asked to join Frieza?</i> Yes... the
cruel, powerful, freakish broo-Saiyan would fit in well with the
cruel, powerful, freakish tyrant and his crew. And if he stole the
head of one of Frieza's advisors...
<p>
NO! The monster had to be stopped, now! But--how? As a spirit, Apio was
nearly powerless against the beast; it knew how to defend itself
against such as he. He needed a body, but whose? Those of
Frieza's soldiers who were weak enough to possess would be too weak to
fight the broo, even if Apio could learn to use an alien body in so
short a time. If only there was a Saiyan up there who--
<p>
Oh. The sudden realization hit him like an electric shock. There
<i>was</i> one Saiyan in the right place...

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
General Nappa, Marshal of Vegetasai, scowled at the spotted green and
purple thing that happened to be the shuttle's pilot. Why couldn't the
wretched creature just do its job?  It was bad enough that he was
stuck up here in the cockpit with it, it didn't have to keep <i>talking</i>
at him!
<p>
Prince Vegeta had forbidden Nappa to accompany him in his tiny, bare
"cabin" (actually, the empty cargo hold), leaving no place else for
the giant Saiyan on the tiny shuttle. Nappa folded his arms and
frowned as the alien, Litchi, scuttled around the cockpit pushing
buttons and waving its skinny arms around. Couldn't the ugly little
creature just get on with it?  They had a planet to clear!
<p>
"General Nappa? Sir?"
<p>
Damn, the stupid thing was <i>still</i> trying to talk to him! If the
creature had been more humanoid, Nappa sourly thought, he could remove
its tongue and vocal cords without impairing its piloting ability in
the least.
<p>
He glowered at the creature. "What?"
<p>
"The launch officer hasn't cleared us for launch, yet. I'm going to go
see what the problem is--it should only take a minute, sir." Litchi
scuttled quickly over to the shuttle hatch and out.
<p>
Nappa leaned back in his seat, already bored to near-violence; why
couldn't they have gone in pods?  Then he could have slept through the
entire journey.
<p>
<i>"No matter what happens, protect the Prince!"</i> Nappa started awake,
with King Vegeta's last command to him ringing through his mind. What
the hell?  How long had he been asleep?  Where was that stupid alien?
<i>What stupid alien?</i> Perhaps he'd better find out. <i>You should</i>.

<p>
Power, reflected Redjack as he stood over the still-bleeding corpse of
the dead launch officer, is of exactly zero use if one doesn't bother
to shield one's back from a sudden thrust. Too bad he didn't have time
to take this one's head, but Redjack could still bind its ghost, he
thought as he hacked off the dead alien's right hand. He could use the
reserve power, if all the tales of young Prince Vegeta's power were
true.
<p>
The broo-Saiyan grinned to himself as he hit the big red "ABORT"
button, halting the shuttle launch. He began to giggle as the hatch
cycled open, anticipating the Saiyan's puzzlement at the aborted
launch, soon to be followed by shock and confusion at the sight of
Redjack--and then the broo would kill Vegeta. After that... steal the
shuttle, go to Earth, kill the Bulma child very, very slowly and then
just... enjoy himself.
<p>
He ducked out of sight, watching the form that emerged, and muttered
foul imprecations to himself. It had a pilot! Redjack's lips curled
back from his teeth in a snarl. Not automated like the pods then.
Redjack smirked. The Saiyans were not pilots, either. Without this
creature, they weren't going anywhere....
<p>
The pilot's brains looked very colorful, Redjack thought a few minutes
later. Much brighter colors than the usual pink, grey and red of human
and broo insides. It didn't taste as good as it looked, but then,
brightly colored fruit was bitter, too.
<p>
According to his scouter, there were two Saiyans in that shuttle; one
immense power that could only be young Vegeta, and another very strong
Saiyan--a bodyguard? All he had to do was surprise the Saiyan and
crush his tail, and the rest would be easy. He'd launch the shuttle
himself, and put young Vegeta to sleep until he was ready for him by
tampering with the air supply. After he took the bodyguard's head,
Redjack estimated that he'd have just enough power to take young
Vegeta--<i>if</i> he caught him asleep and could clamp his tail. Then... oh
yes!
<p>
Then it would be just the two of them, alone in deep space, with no
possible outside interference; Redjack began to drool, anticipating
the exquisite pleasure he would get from the child's body as he broke
the young prince to his will--just before taking his head.

<p>
Down on Vegetasai, Leandro, medical technician and slave, cursed
quietly as he left the regen chambers.  Taman would survive, but he'd
be weeks getting back to his job. The other Saiyan hadn't been so
lucky; he'd died of his burns before the medics could get him into a
tank. Leandro hated losing a patient--even Saiyans. It was his way; he
had been a talented doctor back home.
<p>
The green-skinned alien cut through the creche on his way back to his
duty station; it was the short way through, and besides, Leandro liked
kids. It didn't matter that they were the children of his masters,
they were still babies; he was oath-bound to heal and protect
them. Maybe, just maybe, if he could find Dendretta, they could try to
begin a family...
<p>
Preoccupied with his thoughts, Leandro nearly ran headlong into the
gutter Saiyan slinking through the creche.  The Saiyan whirled,
hissing at the silver tailed, green-skinned, almost-human medic; blood
covered each arm to the elbow.
<p>
Stink of the streets and old death; short horns and hooves, too thick,
braided tail, smashed nursery pods behind the creature--a variety of
things clamored for his attention, all telling Leandro that something
was very, very <i>wrong</i>. Beside him, a baby wailed; another was
frightened and began to cry.
<p>
"WHAT THE HELL--?" Leandro dropped to a crouch just as the thing dove
at him.  It had been a long time since he'd had to fight for the lives
of his patients--since the Saiyan invasion of his home world, in
fact. The irony was not lost on him.
<p>
It was a close fight. Leandro was as strong as a strong third-class,
and Gutclaw now had the power of a mediocre second-class warrior. Like
all fights between near equals, it was hard and brutal; neither
combatant had the power to simply blast his opponent into
oblivion. Instead, they punched and kicked and gouged and tore at each
other, wearing each other down until the strongest was left standing
with barely the strength for the killing blow on his helpless, spent
opponent.
<p>
Blood ran freely from numerous wounds on Gutclaw's body as he turned
away from Leandro's broken form.  The healer wasn't quite dead, but
the heartbeats left to him could be measured in a double handful. Now,
which one was Kakarott?  If only he could read, he'd know. Best to
kill them all. Gutclaw pulled his fist back to smash open the crying
baby's pod--
<p>
Leandro's dying eyes opened wide as he looked past Gutclaw, and his
lips slowly turned up in an almost Saiyan smirk--then his last breath
rattled in his throat and his eyes fixed in an empty stare.
<p>
The hairs on the back of Gutclaw's neck prickled; power was here. He
turned--just as Chishan's fist caught him in the spine, above his belt
of stolen tails.
<p>
Gutclaw howled with pain, and howled again as Chishan's rush carried
them clear of the infant creche and through a wall. He twisted and
threw himself away from the elite warrior, landing between two
occupied regen tanks.
<p>
"Y-you can't attack me in here," the broo stammered frantically,
"you'll kill your own men!"
<p>
Chishan smirked cruelly. "So?"
<p>
The ki blast flared out in an immense plume from Chishan's hand, with
the doubled power of the self-possessed elite behind it. In that
moment, Chishan's power rivalled his father's.  Nothing survived.
<p>
A moment later, Chishan dropped to his knees, gasping with sudden
weakness. What had happened?  What was he doing here, and where were
Yamra and Millette? He had a vague memory of pursuing some alien
monster that was trying to kill infant Saiyans...
<p>
The other warrior! Chishan rushed back to the creche, only to find
confused warriors and terrified technicians gathering about the
Leandro's corpse.
<p>
"Sir! What--?"
<p>
"An assassin got in among the infants, and there was only a slave to
defend them. Where were you fools?  Oh, yes--you were busy getting in
my damn way!" Chishan growled, glancing at the shattered pods and
tiny, bloody corpses in each one. "This <i>warrior</i> died well; give him
honor."
<p>
"Yes, Lord Chishan!" The warriors saluted him; the technicians merely
cowered.
<p>
"And the assassin?" one of the warriors ventured to ask.
<p>
Chishan's answer was a blow that sent him flying across the room to
slam into the wall with a thud. The hapless warrior slid limply to the
floor, blood trickling from his nose and mouth. He twitched for a
moment, and then was still.
<p>
"The assassin is dead," Chishan snarled coldly. The other warriors
cringed, amazed that the questioner hadn't been killed outright for
his insolence in implying that Lord Chishan might have let the
assassin escape.
<p>
The elite turned on his heel to leave, and then turned back. "And make
sure whichever of these infants are due to be launched this afternoon
are indeed launched <i>on time</i>!" Chishan finally left, secure in his
authority, knowing that fear of him was enough to make sure his orders
were carried out.
<p>
"So, which ones are due to be launched?" asked one shaken warrior of
the scurrying technicians.
<p>
The technician stopped to look at his chart and looked back at the
Saiyan with fear-filled eyes. "T-today's are all dead... except for
this one."
<p>
The warrior looked at the pod indicated and grunted. "I guess you
don't have much work to do, then. Get this 'Kakarott' launched and
then clean the mess up!"

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
While Chishan's still-living past self dealt with the fallen,
Chishan's future ghost pursued the fleeing broo spirit across the
city. Chishan had stopped Gutclaw just in time from possessing the
unconscious warrior--the only way to permanently stop the demonic
shaman was to attack him in the borderlands of the spirit realm.
<p>
One swipe of his spirit blade had torn the stolen souls from the
shaman's grasp; a second swipe had robbed the broo of half his
remaining power and sent him fleeing. But where did the bastard think
he was going?
<p>
Chishan had to look only once at the dark maelstrom twisting the
spirit realm of Vegetasai to grasp the answer. Of course! He's running
for the Hell Gate before I can break his power! Ghostly teeth bared in
an invisible snarl. My will is the stronger--I will meet him there!
<p>
Chishan appeared at the gaping maw of the maelstrom just as the broo
tried to pass it.  A single stroke of Chishan's blade severed the
beast's head from its spirit body, and the broo's power was no more.
A shattered wisp of spirit swept through the Hell Gate, bereft of
memory and power.
<p>
The maelstrom collapsed in on itself suddenly, leaving Chishan staring
at a rapidly dissipating eddy in the borderlands of Vegetasai.

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Redjack was just reaching for the shuttle's hatch when it opened
abruptly, catching the broo in the face and sending him tumbling
backwards. Nappa stepped out of the hatch with power crackling around
him, his mouth set in a very un-Nappa-like line of barely restrained
anger. "Now we finish this, demon!"
<p>
Redjack's scouter exploded--then so did what was left of Cumber and
Rhubra. The broo screamed as his mindlink to the two severed heads was
brutally torn away, and then howled in rage at the loss of the captive
souls he'd broken to <i>his</i> will.
<p>
It wasn't a bodyguard Redjack faced--it was the Marshal of Vegetasai...
and something more.
<p>
Redjack did not escape.

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Back on Vegetasai, here-and-now Apio cursed and surged into the air,
backtracking the assassin. The king and his Guard would have to deal
with the assassin now, but Commander Apio half-remembered his fight
with the assassin and he didn't like what he remembered.
<p>
It took him only moments to find the holed building; angry, confused
Saiyans were beginning to spill out of the doors and balconies,
looking for the author of the destruction.  Apio dove past them into
Rhubra's quarters--
<p>
--and dodged a ki-ball flung at his head. A young girl crouched behind
the table that still held Rhubra's headless corpse, teeth bared in a
snarl and her tail curled tightly around her waist. Both hands were
up, ready to block any return attack--one dropped quickly down to
clutch at her torn armor before the entire front fell off.

<p>"Good technique, decent reflexes," Apio said. "You were trained
well--but check your target first."

<p>
The girl lowered her arms. "I thought you were that monster again!"
Her eyes widened as she took in Apio's marks of rank, and she knelt
before him. "Forgive me, noble Commander; I would not have attacked if
I had known."
<p>
Apio's eyes narrowed. Her voice was steady, but she trembled almost
imperceptibly, no doubt fearing that her apology might not be enough
for the deadly insult she had inadvertantly offered.
<p>
"Get up," he growled. "Are you her brat?" Apio waved a hand at
the corpse.
<p>
The girl shook her head as she rose to her feet. "No, sir; my parents
are off-world. I am--I was--fostered with Rhubra until they
return. She was my aunt..." Her voice trailed off.
<p>
Apio's thoughts raced. Normally, he'd leave the brat to her own
devices--she was old enough to survive on her own until her fosterage
was sorted out--but he had the odd feeling that time was running out.
<p>
"Name?" Apio asked abruptly. Choy would like her; the girl
was spunky and bright and Choy had been hinting strongly about
children lately...
<p>
"Cressa, sir." She saluted him, "Cressa of the Hsurajiti."
<p>
Apio returned the salute, "Commander Apio of the Surseijiti."
<p>
Cressa's eyes widened, recognizing the name of his ancient, noble
tribe. "Yes, s--Commander!"
<p>
"You can fly?" At her nod, he continued, "Then follow. Until your
fosterage is straightened out, you'll stay with my wife."
<p>
The young girl nodded. "Yes, sir!" As Apio turned to go, Cressa gave
her aunt's corpse a troubled glance; her lip trembled slightly.
<p>
Apio noticed. "Are you hurt?"
<p>
"No! But..."

<p>Apio frowned. "That's no way to leave a warrior. There's no time for
the rites..." He stretched out one hand and concentrated; a brilliant
flash lit the room as the blast of power consumed the mortal remnants
of Rhubra of the Hsurajiti.

<p>
A short while later they both touched down in front of a low, domed
house far from the crowded, irritable city. Apio the Strong, Son of
Nappa, cared little for the intrigues and temptations of city life;
when home from missions or other work, all he wanted was a quiet,
comfortable place with plenty of food and his wife. He pushed open the
door.
<p>
"Choy," he said to his startled, but pleased wife, "we have a guest
tonight."
<p>
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Chishan finally caught up with himself back in the Slave
Quarter. Something was bothering his former self, and he was going to
his favorite relaxation--again.
<p>
Yes, I do have things to do, Chishan thought as he became himself and
and entered a familiar apartment on the Street of Whores. A timid
slave girl answered his knock, and stammered as she told the noble
warrior that Yamra and Millette were out.
<p>
Chishan looked at the lovely orange girl and smirked; his tail
uncurled and lashed behind him. Her exotic face and badly-hidden fear
aroused and distracted him... It wouldn't take long to drag her to a
bedchamber and take his pleasure with her, then he could--No, damn it!
I'm not here to rape <i>another</i> slave girl! Don't I have enough to
answer for?
<p>
"Where's the green girl?" He asked harshly. "The one I had last
night."
<p>
"Dendretta?" The white-haired orange girl put a finger to her
lips. "She's resting in her chambers, my lord. Mistress Yamra has set
her aside to heal." She licked her lips and smiled up at the fierce
warrior; her hands rose to stroke her breasts, emphasizing their
curves. "I am available and ready to serve as it pleases you, my
lord."
<p>
Chishan smirked again; the slave's fear had abated as she noted the
signs of lust rather than anger in the powerful Saiyan. He grabbed her
by the throat and pressed her up against the wall.
<p>
"And if it pleases me to kill you?" He snarled softly; the fear lept
back into her eyes. "Take me to Dendretta, now!"
<p>
"Yes, my lord," the orange girl said as she scurried down a hallway,
Chishan close behind.  The slave girl opened a door and let him
in. Eyes downcast, with the slightest hint of bitterness in her voice,
she asked, "Shall I kill myself now, wait for Yamra to do so, or do
you wish the pleasure, my lord?"
<p>
Chishan looked at her and smiled wryly. Of course, Yamra would kill
her for disobeying orders; no Saiyan tolerated a disobedient
slave--even if the slave was merely following the orders of a
higher-ranking Saiyan. In any case, he should kill her right now for
insolence.
<p>
This day, none of that mattered. He laughed coldly.
<p>
"Don't worry; it won't be Yamra or I who kills you. Go back to your
duties and be content." He stepped into the room and closed the door
behind him, shutting her out.
<p>
The green girl sat up on her sleeping mat, holding a blanket close to
her. Tears still streaked her face, and she stared at Chishan with
terror written across her face.
<p>
"I have a question for you," Chishan asked, tilting his head to one
side. "Why is a brothel-slave so terrified of sex? That makes no sense
to me--you surely knew what your duties would be, and that you are
valuable enough to be taken care of."
<p>
Terror was replaced by puzzlement, and she clutched the blanket
closer. "It does not matter... my lord. It is only a foolish slave
girl's concerns."
<p>
"Ordinarily, I would agree with you--nor would I be talking to you,"
Chishan purred in a soft, dangerous voice, stepping closer to the
girl. "I would simply take what I wanted and leave you to your
concerns--but this is not an ordinary day for me, and I would have an
answer!"
<p>
"My lord... you would not understand," she said in a small
voice. Chishan crossed the room to her and knelt on the mat; she
trembled as he took her in his arms.
<p>
He held her, nothing more, until the trembling died away; then he
released the sad green girl and looked at her, idly twining her dark
green hair about his fingers. "You didn't scream when I touched you
this time, so it is hardly the touch of a Saiyan that terrifies you,"
Chishan noted. "Tell me."
<p>
Dendretta regarded the somber Saiyan with confusion. "You are... not
like before. Why?"
<p>
Ancient pain flashed across Chishan's face. "I know my fate, and it is
not good. Even a warrior can have regrets."
<p>
The pale green slave girl looked at the fey Saiyan. "What you
did... On my world, I was betrothed, to a very fine man, and he still
lives--he is a doctor, and valuable, so your soldiers captured him to
sell as they did me--but y-you..." Tears ran down her face as she
fought to hold back sobs. "Leandro will never have me now; he will
spit upon me. I am sullied, tainted. I permitted a man not my
betrothed to lay with me; I am a whore, unchaste and fit only for
stoning!" Dendretta could no longer hold back her sobs.
<p>
Chishan's eyes narrowed. "<i>Permitted</i>? You had no choice; I am the
stronger!" He gripped her arm, "I have not heard this much foolishness
since--" Zukini was a child, he'd been about to say. Crud! Was that
it?
<p>
"How old are you among your kind?" he asked abruptly. "Are you of age
to marry? Is that why you were still only betrothed?"
<p>
She nodded slowly. "In two more years, I would have been permitted to
marry him--but now, all is lost--" Her incipient wail was cut off by
Chishan's big hand across her mouth.
<p>
His voice was harsh with self-directed anger. "Shut up. You've got
worse problems than that--and your misplaced virginity is very far
from the top of the list. A regen tank could fix <i>that</i> damage, if it
mattered--and it doesn't. There's nothing wrong with whores, girl--you
insult your mistresses as well as yourself! The real problem is that
you're too young; you don't know what's worth breaking your heart over
and what isn't--and you have about 30 minutes to grow up," he growled
angrily. "Now, tell me about this Leandro."
<p>
I've raped a child, he thought, a sheltered, innocent child. I nearly
broke her body and mind, and I did break her heart. Damn! Aren't the
purges enough to be damned for, without adding this, too?
<p>
"Well, he's a doctor, and the Medical Center owns him, I think. He's
very handsome, with a dimple on his chin when he smiles..." As she
described her true love, her silver-furred tail fluffed up--and
Chishan knew, knew with utter certainity who Leandro was.
<p>
"You'll be seeing him soon, I think" Chishan said, his voice ragged
and harsh. "And don't worry--I don't think he'll reject you."
<p>
"How can you know?" She asked, then gasped as she beheld his somber
face and pained eyes.
<p>
"Because such things don't matter when you're dead, girl." She should
have been terrified, but she saw no sign of the cruel Saiyan smirk on
his face, only despair and deeply-buried anger.
<p>
"Leandro died well; he saved a child."  At the stark dismay on her
face, he continued. "Make what preparations are important to you,
girl; don't waste your time with grief--within an hour, you and
everyone else still on this world will die. Only the child Leandro
saved will survive."
<p>
"Everyone else? Even you?" Dendretta chose to lean against the
despairing Saiyan for the first time. She brushed his face with one
delicate, pale green hand; how strange it was that her ravisher was
the first one of them to see her as something other than a useful
animal! One does not offer words of comfort, even cold, harsh ones, to
animals...
<p>
"Especially me." Chishan swallowed hard, finally finding the courage
to say what he'd come here to say. "Forgive me, girl, if you
can. I... I'm sorry."
<p>

<p>
Chishan sat alone, brooding over a beer when Apio's ghost finally
drifted into the tavern. Apio regarded his brother thoughtfully, then
tapped him on the shoulder.
<p>
Chishan blinked and looked around, puzzled, then his eyes widened. "I
can see you! I didn't expect that--actually I expected you to show up
in the flesh." He frowned. "What happened?"

<p>Apio snorted, a sound only Chishan could hear. "Things changed, and
I didn't care to interrupt myself."

<p>
A brief grin flashed across Chishan's face. "You went home to Choy,
didn't you? You dog!" The smirk on Apio's face was answer
enough. Chishan turned serious, and slowly drained his mug to the
half-way mark. "Ap, the gate's gone--I saw it collapse."
<p>
Apio frowned. "You got the last broo?"
<p>
Chishan nodded. "And you?"
<p>
Apio smirked, remembering the awesome power he'd used against the broo
headhunter--his own not-inconsiderable power combined with his
father's near-legendary strength. It had been a very short fight.
<p>
"Job's done," he answered.
<p>
"We'll die again with Vegetasai," brooded Chishan
<p>
"We're already dead, 'Shan."

<p>"But these bodies we borrowed aren't... not yet. It won't be very
long now."  Chishan set his mug down deliberately.

<p>
"No, it won't." Apio looked past him at the crowd in the
tavern. Sarada and his hangers-on weren't there yet, but Til and his
girl had already grabbed their customary seats at the bar.
<p>
Chishan regarded his ghostly brother thoughtfully. "We've
changed the past a bit, mostly for ourselves--"
<p>
"Not just for ourselves, 'Shan" Apio told him, thinking of how this
last day had changed for Choy, Cressa, Rhubra and Cumber. Would he
have new memories of his own last hours when they returned to Hell?
<p>
"I said 'mostly', Ap.  Yeah, I changed a few pasts, too." He
sighed. "What <i>were</i> you doing for the last few hours, originally?"

<p>Apio snorted. "Exactly nothing--just nursing my beer.  Always did
that after a mission." He looked at his brother, eyes slowly widening
in his broad face. "I never went straight home to Choy after a
mission; I always wound down here. Going straight from killing bugs to
pleasuring Choy just didn't work."

<p>
"I... Some guys got off on purges," Chishan observed. "It's exciting."
<p>
Apio scowled and asked pointedly, "You mean the assholes who couldn't
wait to jump out of their pods, go down to the Slave Quarter and
rape a few whores?"
<p>
Chishan winced. "You know, Ap, you wouldn't have said something like
that back then."  Chishan drank his beer slowly.
<p>
"I saw what the broo did when he 'got excited'. He wasn't picky
about gender or age. Any <i>warrior</i> who acts like that...." he trailed
off in a wordless growl, a vicious sound that raised the hairs on the
back of Chishan's neck.

<p>
"Even your own brother?" Chishan studied the bottom of his mug. "I
wasn't exactly innocent of that, you know. And after chasing that broo
into the Slave Quarter..."  He shuddered and drained his mug. "I guess
my sins as a mass murderer outweighed the occasional slave rape, or
I'd have been in a different Hell. Funny, I don't feel the same
enthusiasm for purges anymore, either." He set his empty mug
down and glanced around at the others in the spaceport tavern.
<p>
"It's hard to remember why we enjoyed it so much. Ap, why did we like
killing things that weren't strong enough to put up a decent fight? On
my last purge some desperate furred thing threw himself on me armed
with nothing but a knife--he was trying to protect his nest. I broke
his back and left him lying there to watch while my partner tore open
the nest; we dragged out his mate and children one by one and
slaughtered them. With each one, we pretended we couldn't find any
more--and just as the poor bastard got his hopes up, we dragged the
next one out and killed it, laughing the whole time at his pleas and
his screams. Why did we think that was funny?"

<p>Apio stared quizzically at the floor, as if wondering what it was
doing there. "It was a whole lot funnier before Frieza did it to us. A
lot of things are more amusing when you're not on the receiving
end. I stopped finding those particular games amusing after
Diive's execution."

<p>He sighed, and looked away, not meeting Chishan's eyes.  "I held the
woman and child while Father killed them. I hated them almost as much
as he did, for what they'd done to Diive--and I saw what the killing
did to Diive."

<p>Still not meeting Chishan's eyes, he said, "I was so proud of
my own strength, and so damn angry at Diive for the shame he'd brought
on us--on <i>me</i>.  I mocked him for a weakling--he cared about those
pathetic creatures! Not 'til I met Choy did I figure out that I was a
bigger fool than Trigo that day. I thought I hated Diive as I helped you
and Col hold him down while Father staked him out and did the
rest.... Then I stood with the others and watched Diive die, all those
long hours.  By the end I knew I'd never hated him, and I knew he
wasn't the real weakling there."

<p>
Knuckles whitened as Chishan's hands tightened around the beer mug;
the other patrons of the tavern carefully stayed clear of the brooding
elite who muttered angrily to himself. "I haven't spoken of Diive
since that day--while we were alive it was forbidden, and
afterwards..."

<p>"Losing him that way was bad enough, but losing him <i>again</i>....  I'm
glad he's where he is, though; facing him would be hard, real hard."

<p>
"Who would have expected it? Father lost Mother the same way," Chishan
brooded. "I didn't have anyone to lose that way, but you and Choy...."

<p>"It wasn't the same. I know I'll never go where Diive went, but
there's always a chance I can follow Choy someday, and see her
again..."

<p>
"But you won't know her, and she won't know you, and neither of you
will remember what it is to be Saiyan, Ap." Chishan's hands trembled
as he held the beer mug tight.
<p>
"Might be worth it, 'Shan. Maybe my head won't know her, but my
heart will."

<p>Chishan sighed deeply. "Sometimes I think it might be
worth it, just to lose all the regrets. It would be... good to do
things right the next time around."

<p>
Apio gave his brother a slow smile. "Like you did these last few hours?"
<p>
Chishan looked sharply at his ghostly brother and then smiled. "You
dog! Yeah. And I always thought you were the slow one--after Trigo, of
course."
<p>
Apio chuckled. "Why? 'Cause I don't talk much, and think
things through first?"
<p>
Chishan smirked. "Yeah. And you've got dad's build and, uh, blunt
face--"

<p>"'Blunt'?" Apio snorted. "You mean 'homely'. You forgot to say,
'you've got dad's brains, too.'. I knew that's what people
thought. Didn't much care." He stared at Chishan's nearly empty mug,
and then back at his brother. "You need to return what you've
borrowed."

<p>
"Yeah. Just give me a few more minutes.... I miss the little things,
like the taste of beer. Just a few more minutes."
<p>

<p>
Once again, Bardock stumbled into the tavern, battered and bloody.
He crashed into what would have been Apio's table, but was now
Chishan's, knocking it over and startling the normally reserved
warrior.  Once again, he made his desperate plea for help, and once
again, was mocked for a drunken fool. Once again, he cursed them
truly, and staggered out, determined to carry out his desperate
mission alone if need be.
<p>
Chishan's ghost watched from across the room, and winced; knowing the
truth made these moments more painful than ever. Chishan had finally
abandoned the borrowed body of his past self, fearing to interfere
with his own soul's passage.
<p>
"How long now, 'Shan?" dead Apio wondered.
<p>
"Not long; fifteen minutes, half an hour, maybe," answered his ghostly
brother.
<p>
"We know what happens here; I've always wondered what
Bardock's last fight looked like."
<p>
"So have I, Ap. Let's go."
<p>

<p>
"Damn! He just took them <i>all</i> on--and he's winning, 'Shan."
<p>
"Half dead at that. Hell, even Nappa wasn't that good! Now we know
where Kakarott got his strength from!"
<p>
"Crud." Apio spat out one pithy curse as Frieza rose from the upper
hatch.
<p>
"Ap, Bardock is <i>attacking Frieza</i>! Will you look at that ki ball!
Hell, the <i>king</i> wasn't that powerful!"
<p>
"Oh, crud." Frieza's death ball expanding into a huge lurid orange
sphere and sailed inexorably toward Bardock and the planet below.
<p>
"Crud."
<p>
The deadly energy sphere enveloped and passed harmlessly through the
disembodied spirits and continued its plummet to the planet below.
Apio and Chishan watched as the ball struck and burrowed into the
planet's crust, creating massive spreading fissures filled with
seething energies that melted and shattered the adjacent crust.
<p>
One such upheaval of ki-laced lava burst through the floor of the
spaceport tavern, killing everyone inside almost instantly, though not
painlessly. The inhabitants of the Slave Quarter were far weaker; few
of them even felt their fiery deaths. Cressa, Choy and the then-living
Apio perished as the fissure spread, swallowed in molten lava for a
brief, supremely agonizing moment before death took them all.
<p>
Finally the destroying energy reached the core of the planet, flooding
the heavy metal core of Vegetasai with vast energies, energies that
triggered the catastrophic fission of those heavy
elements.... Vegetasai exploded in a brilliant blaze of nuclear fire,
and everything went white--

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Long afterwards....
<p>
Chishan brooded alone under the non-sky of Hell, wrapped in the cloak of
a Saiyan commander.  "Apio..." he whispered to the shadow in his
heart--but Apio himself was gone where Chishan could not follow.
<p>
No, not could not--would not. "I'm not ready yet, Ap. You chose to
follow Choy, and I hope you find her... but I'm Saiyan, Ap, and I
can't be other than what I am, even when I regret what I am so much."
He'd said those words to Apio when they both stood before Lord Enma
for the second time; he said them now, in his heart, as he'd said them
so many times when the loneliness became a hell all its own.
<p>
"Not yet..." he finally added.
