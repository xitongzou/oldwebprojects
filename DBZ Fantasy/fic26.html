Part 1</H3>

<H3 align=center>Prologue</H3>

<P>The characters in this are: Bandy, Lilaca, Shielaka, Zonaie  and Android 
1335.

<P>It  was  a nice evening and Bandy had nearly finished creating the most 
amazing invention with her Mother Hananiza. It was a time Machine to go back 
in time with. [ Bandy is an unusual girl., she is only 4 and she is an 
absolute genius!] As soon as it was ready, her  Mother said don't touch it,  
[because they made it for her Mother] but of course Bandy jumped right in 
and being the genius that she is, she worked out how to operate it quick as 
a flash! Then she came to an enormous Planet. It was at least 5 as big as 
Earth. It would do though, it had beautiful ripe fruits to eat and lots of 
clear streams to drink from. That is where the story begins.

<H3 align=center>Episode1 Saiyan vs Saiyan</H3>

<P>A strange girl was walking around some delicious looking apple trees feeling 
peckish. Then she saw something lurking in the distance on the extreme edge 
of the deep dark forest. It looked so much like a blob and a blur and it was 
extremely  hard to make out but she could sense a tiny power level smaller 
than hers, and her own was only 234.  Then she realised this power level was 
lethal even though it was smaller than hers, she cannot control her own.
She was scared as the figure approached her. She quickly hid behind a tree 
wondering what to do, knowing that she would soon spot her.

<P>Bandy hard a rustle in the tree behind her  feeling scared also, though she 
was not as scared as Lilaca as she was a brave kind of person. She managed 
to find the courage to shout, " Who's there!" in a shaky voice.

<P>Lilaca remained perfectly still and quiet. She caught a glimpse of a rock 
nearby that, if she got the chance, could run and hide behind. But at the 
moment she must remain quite still.

<P>Bandy thought that it must have been a bird so she got back to eating 
apples. As she turned her back  she heard some summers lush grass swaying, 
the long swooshy type, did not want to turn around but she had to look.

<P>Lilaca wondered what to do she realised that Bandy knew there was something 
behind her and made a dash for the nearest tree, just in time, she thought. 
But she was wrong Bandy knew exactly where she was but hid it from her. 
Lilaca tip toed this time to the rock.

<P>Bandy was waiting for the right time to fire a Ki blast, she tried when 
Lilaca was just behind the rock. She out stretched her arm and fired and 
destroyed the rock to uncover the face of Lilaca, now snow white, her eyes 
bright blue and her lip shaking.

<P>Lilaca didn't have a clue what to do so in the end she charged.
"Aaaaaaaarrrrrrrggggggghhhhhhhh!" She screamed.
"Kamehameha!!!!!!" She powered up and shot.
She realised that she could hardly control herself whilst doing this attack 
but she had no other choice.
"Argh!" Bandy yelled in pain.
Lilaca realized a second afterwards that she'd gone too far.
How dare  a a a girl attack  a princess like me thought an angered Bandy she 
stuck back with "GALLOT GUN" she screamed with all her might. Lilaca knew 
that an angry girl was stronger than an normal girl she also knew what was 
about to happen, it was Lilaca's turn to cry out in pain.
Both girls knew what was next .........A BATTLE.

<H3 align=center>Episode2  Beat all Bandy</H3>

<P>Lilaca powered up she knew she couldn't control her power but she had to do 
something to stop this unexpected power.
"Argh" screamed Lilaca Bandy had attacked again this time with a unpleasant 
kick.
Lilaca was bleeding however nothing could stop Bandy. Bandy landed on the 
ground and started
Fiddling with a watch kinda thing.
Great thought Lilaca I can attack "Kamehameha"
She yelled.
Bandy jumped out the way "Darn" said Lilaca
She fired more ki blasts each time Bandy jumped away. Lilaca stopped to 
catch her breath Bandy was only, Whoa what was Bandy doing
Thought Lilaca. She stared Bandys watch turned into a computer and not an 
old shabby computer , a brand new decorated one. Lilaca was amazed that a 
tiny red haired girl with absolutely no manners would be able to have a 
valuable thing like that.  The computer suddenly fired a lazor at Lilaca, 
she had no idea it was going to do that so she got hurt really bad. She had 
a huge wound in her belly and was loosing blood quickly. She didn't  know 
what to do . Bandy laughed
Cruel ,evil laughter and the sound of a girl in pain.
Bandy's computer turned back into a watch and a  dragon jumped out "GET LOST 
BREEZE"yelled Bandy, the dragon walked over near the  apple tree and rolled 
over.
Lilaca screamed  yet again Bandy  had attacked ,another kick .
Bandy  tried again but Lilaca was too quick , Bandy missed .
True Lilaca was injured  and barely able to defend herself but still Bandy 
could be a turtle and she could be a cheetah.
"Kamehame"yelled an exhausted Lilaca  but it never ended Lilaca hadn't got 
enough power to use another ki blast. The wound in her belly was slowly 
killing her and zapping away her energy.
Lilaca knew her death had come but she wasn't prepared to give up not yet 
and not to a tiny
Redhead girl who wore shabby clothes and a orange bandanna .Bandy  might 
have been a genius
But she didn't know what was coming.
Lilaca put nearly all her energy into
A powerful ki blast it hit Bandy head on.
She screamed twice, and at least as much energy was zapped away from her as 
from Lilaca. But she soon repaired herself and made a huge "Kamehameha!!!" 
Bandy yelled! It banged right into Lilaca and she had only a few seconds of 
life left she knew it! Bandy powered up again ready to fire a Mega power Ki 
blast.
"No Stop!!!!!" yelled Lilaca " I surrender!!!!"
"Too late!" yelled Bandy back.
" Please no!" pleaded Lilacu . " Why shouldn't I?"
Bandy said sounding selfish.
"I suppose I could spare you if I must." She said a bit more kindly.

<H3 align=center>Episode 3 Chat of the Saiyans</H3>

<P>" Why are you so troubled?" asked Breeze having come out from his hiding 
place in the tree.
"I have enormous powers but I cannot control them." Lilaca said glumly.
"I do not know what to do." She added.
"Maybe we could train together!" Bandy suggested, for once being thoughtful 
for others."
"Good idea, but I might hurt you in my uncontrollable powers!" Lilaca 
feeling worried.
"Well you don't have to brag about it." Bandy said disapprovingly." So who 
are you "I'm-"Bandy was interrupted "I'm Breeze-I'm a dragon I'm a pure 
blood Dragon, 'm I'm err well I don't grant wishes "  Bandy knocked Breeze 
flying " Hi I'm Bandy I'm from the future, I'm also a princess"
Bandy smiled it really makes her look unrecognisable thought Lilaca
"lets talk in the time machine" moaned Breeze "I'm cold"  Bandy and Breeze 
walked towards the time machine.
"Wait you can't leave me like this" cried Lilaca  "sorry " said Bandy she 
reached for her watch pressed a button and Lilaca was healed.
"Thank you, but I'm loosing too much blood and I'm in trouble!"
"No problem,I'll just have to put this helmet on you,"
Bandy reached for a red shiny helmet and put it on Lilaca's head.
"there you go!" She said excitedly.
