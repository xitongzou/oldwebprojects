" Maybe we should get ready for bed,Chi-Chi."  Bulma suggested to Chi-Chi. Chi-Chi glanced back at the table,full of Gokus favorite foods.She sulked towards the table taking a glance up at the clock,11:30. She started gathering the silver ware."Yeah,I guess your right.. Come over here and help me!"ChiChi teased trying to lighten up the sad atmosphere.Bulma smiled and gathered the food along with Chi Chi. As they finished up packing all they could into the oven,Bulma wrote the temp* that the food should be heated at,just in case they had gone to bed when Goku and Vegeta returned. ChiChi tilted her head as her eyebrows got serious,"All this food!!And those two numbskulls didn't even show up!" Bulma laughed and jogged over to the other side of the kitchen,"hotchocolate?" Chi Chi nodded,"Yeah,you go ahead and make that.I'm gunna change out of these clothes,so I don't get them wrinkled..or for that matter,not to spill chocolate on it either." ChiChi rested her hands inside the folds of the long blue dress.
<P>
She and Bulma had gone shopping just the other day.ChiChi's dress went down to her ankles,with folds that were big enough to fit your hands in.The blue was a deep royal color,no straps,but just fit perfectly around her tiny shoulders.Bulmas dress was the same style,but the color was a light azure purple. The straps held sparkly diamonds in a row.
<P>
Bulma sighed as she too noticed the beautiful gown she wore.She smiled with encouragement,"ChiChi we'll tell the guys to take us somewhere special.So these dresses won't need to be refunded." Chi Chi smiled and sighed a brief 'yeah'.
<P>
As the two girls rested upon the couch.Bulma in her purple silky pj's,and Chi-Chi in her coffee oriented pj set."I'm too nervous now to watch tv.I mean its already 2:30!" ChiChis voice was jittery as she stood up with the empty mug."Yeah I feel exactly how you do.Hey you mind taking these to the sink?"Bulma handed ChiChi her mug.Just as ChiChi started to the kitchen she glanced up at Bulma.Tears were strolling down her pale cheaks.ChiChi sat the mugs down and gave her friend a hug."They'll come back.They'll come back." Now both girls were crying louder and louder as each second passed. "Okay.. I'll see you in the morning."they both agreed and walked to their bedrooms,Each girl taking a different hall to their own bedroom.
<P>
As bulma reached her room,she walked over to her balcony.She refused to look at the clock.She stood at her balcony and slouched over resting her tired head on the railing.Her sobbs seemed pitiful,as she wished her only love would return safely to her tonight. <I>Right here,Right now.On this balcony..If only he had told me where he was!</I> Bulmas thoughts began smashing into other thoughts as she grew too tired to stand. She reached her bed with an uncomfortable fall. But she was too tired to care.Her body went limp as she fell into a state of unconscienceness,sleep.
<P>
Chi Chi stood up and walked over to where a picture of her and Goku stood.She took it up in her hands and slowly walked back to her bed.As she sat down, she also set the picture down. Her eyes were blood red from painful crying. She listened to every tick of the clock.4:30.<I>Where is my Goku? Why can't he come home to me ?Oh Lord please protect him! </I>ChiChi hoped her prayer was heard. She pulled her feat up and under the cold blankets. She felt her eyes swelling as she shut out all things around her. Her tears felt frozen on her cheaks as she quickly jumped up out of bed, <I>how can I sleep when I know that he's gone?!</I> ChiChi flattened down the sheets and sat upon them. The darkness caved in around her as her arms and legs began feeling numb. Her tears would not quit falling!! She realized how loud she must've been and tried to cease her sobs. She laid back on her pillow, her neck stiff. Just then the door opened to her room, a shower of light touched her cold cheaks."ChiChi!!Oh ChiChi!"Goku stood there,sounding alarmed at the sight.ChiChi sighed as Goku held her in his arms once more.Chi Chi sobbed once more and rested her  her on his chest,"I love you Goku.Don't ever do that again!! Where were you??You promised to be backat 7:30 at the latest!!!"Chi Chis tears turned into fuming words."Me and Bulma slaved over a hot oven all day long!!Just to fill .." Goku caught her silent as he kissed her lovingly.He brought her close to him,up in his arms.He whispered a song into her ear.A fimiliar tune,yet didn't register into her mind since she was so drenched with sleep.He laid her upon the bed,taking the blanket and covered her small body."I love you ChiChi.Please don't ever forget that."He knealed next to her side and rested his cheak upon hers.He felt the coldness of her,and the wetness of her tears.He relized how much she loved him too. Without changing clothes he laid next to her, and kept his arm around her waist hoping to warm her.
<P>
*As Vegata came into the cold room he saw Bulma in their bed,she almost disappeared in its' size. He smiled and walked to her side of the bed.He spotted a crystaline tear on her cheek.He glanced down and knew that he had caused it. As he sat beside her he stroked her cheek,waking her.Bulma saw his figure and jumped at him causing them both to fall to the floor.She squeezed him tight. "Your home!Your home!" Bulma whispered in excitement.Vegeta sat up,and Bulma followed into his lap. "Wait a minute..you're not mad?" Vegeta flinched back,surprised."I'm too happy to see you to be mad!" She kissed his cheek. "I do believe the mighty prince of Saiyans is blushing.Lets see how red you can get!" She reached up again and kissed his soft lips.As soon as the two parted,Bulma laughed at her bright red prince!*
<P>
"Bulma how you fell in love with me is a great mystery.How can a human a sweet as you fall in love with a Saiyan as rude as I ?" Vegeta kept his face lowered as he dressed into his pj's.Bulma's face fell in grief as fast as it had brightened. She leaped forward thrusting herself in Vegeta's arms,"I love you Vegeta.You are <I>my</I> prince.And I love you." Vegeta stood still fealing her grip around him.He slowly brought his arms around her waist.He slouched down,resting his head on her shoulder.Bulma smiled and embraced him a little tighter. He looked up,"Bulma?" Bulma nodded."How will you tolerate.." Bulma looked up not wanting him to finish his sentence,"No matter what we go through,Vegeta, we'll always stick together!Do you remember our wedding vows?Through hard times and through good.We will remain faithful to one another!"Bulma's eyes had swelled up with tears as she spoke. "As long as I love you.And as long as you love me.."Bulma sniffled,but was quickly pulled in by Vegetas warm embrace.<I> How could I have made her cry! How will I show her that I really love her?</I> "Bulma..please don't cry.It..it hurts. "Vegeta sat on their bed and had his head cupped in his hands.Bulma stared down at him shocked to see him crying.She fell down to her knees and looked up into his beatiful eyes.She saw the pain dwelling in his mind.She couldn't bare to see him so broken appart.She knew how much he loved her.She shut her eyes and rested her head on his knee."Please..Bulma..know that I love you.." Bulma heard his voice tremble,she stood up and placed her arms around his neck.The two sat in silence holding eachother close.The only thing that was spilled into the atmosphere were the words,"<I>I love you."
<P>
</I>As ChiChi felt Gokus presence she turned herself around and faced him.He watched her eyes slowly open. "Thankyou Goku,Thankyou."He kissed her forehead and brought her closer to his side,"Cry and I will be here for you.If your in trouble I will be there for you.And if you feel I'm not..Always pray to your God.He's the one who brought me to you tonight.Love him.Like I do." Chi Chi smiled and kissed him back.she fell asleep in Gokus arms.
<P>
The next morning ChiChi awoke at noise coming from the kitchen.She glanced over at Goku.His eyes were shut contently.She smiled at his cuteness and got up.She wore her robe as she entered the kitchen."Oh!Hi Bulma!" Bulma stood at the oven cooking.Chi Chi walked to her fastly."You better keep it down.We don't wanna wake our hunnies." "You mean,your hunny?Vegeta got up early today to train.He trains too much." Silence filled  the air,besides the sizziling of the pancakes. Already three stacks high sat next to Bulma."Let me help." Chi Chi smiled and brought out another pan.
<P>
"So how was your night?"Bulma quetioned with a hint of mischeif in her eye."It was fine.Goku..oh Goku.He is so romantic!!I want to be with him always.I hope my bad mood won't scare him into a divorce!"Bulma laughed but soon found it wasn't a joke."No you have a sweet mood all the time!Its me you should worry about!"Bulma giggled but stopped mid- her laughing. ChiChi looked up to see Goku standing right in front of them."Oh hi!"ChiChi smiled nervously and hoped he hadn't heard their girl to girl conversing.To late he had,"ChiChi please come here." ChiChi bit her lip in ebarresment and walked over to him.He lifted his hand to touch her cheak."I love you also ChiChi.No matter what mood your in I'll always want ta' be with you.Always!"A tear swelled up in his eye.He kissed her,following that with a gentle hug.He wore his smiley face boxers his eyes still drooping from sleep.Along with his hair all messed up.She ran her fingers through his hair and rested her head upon his chest,fealing it exhale and inhale. The two stood there holding eachother."Thankyou,thank-you my sweet gal."
<P>
Bulma stood facing them for a while but soon left for her bedroom.As she got there Vegeta sat on the bed."I thought you had gone to train?" Vegeta stood up and walked to her,"Aren't you more important?Come here,I wan't to show you something." He picked her up in his arms and flew off of the balcony."Where are we going?" "To where I once lived a long time ago." Bulma looked up questioning his answer. "No,No..not another secret
<P>
spot!Vegeta!!" Vegeta laughed quietly at the woman he held closely. "Nope you guessed wrong!As I said before where I once lived a long time ago." Bulma looked up at him with anger in her eyes,"WHAT!!Where <B>you</B> lived,no longer exists!Come on Vegeta!Do I look that stupid!"Bulma let her grip losen around Vegetas neck,but soon figured she would fall if she didn't hold on. Vegeta thrust a deep sigh into the air."Stop worrying!!Don't you trust me ? Now come on!" Bulma threw the evil eye at him,as he gained a faster speed into the morning atmosphere.
<P>
"Goku what song was that?" ChiChi paused as she looked down at his feat squirming below."The one you sang to me last night?"Goku smiled down at her and answered," I sang that to you when I first gazed upon you.When I first saw who you really were."ChiChi smiled satisfied and fell into the motion of his breathing once more.The place there,with just the two of them  made ChiChi's heart overflow with love and passion for her Goku. <I>You Goku,I will always love..
<P>
Vegeta 's landing was smooth upon the rocky land. He set Bulma down after a quick kiss.Bulmas eyes opened wide at the beauty of the place."Vegeta!!Its so beautiful here!" Bulma squeeled and glanced back at him.She couldn't help but run up to the edge of the cliff.As she came upon the edge.She saw the vast sea spred before her.The ground upon which she stood felt soft like sand.She was sure it was but didn't want to take her eyes off the beauty of Gods creation.But she soon glanced down remembering Vegetas words,<I>I'm taking you to a place where I once lived.</I> Bulma turned around seeing Vegeta up high on a rock overlooking the sea.The wind blowing through his hair."It is beautiful."Vegeta's reply sailed through the salty air."You..lived..here?" Bulma watched him carefully moving slowly torwards him.Vegeta jumped off the rock at Bulmas side.He held her hand walking to the edge.He looked at her and smiled,"This place..this place is so special to me." bulma nodded patiently."When I lived on Planet Vegeta..when I was a boy.I would go to a place.Much like here whenever I would get the chance away from training. This place resembles it so much its almost unmistakeable."Vegeta smiled and shut his eyes as it seemed he was trying to collect his child memories. Bulma smiled as she saw her happy prince. The two stayed along the coast line untill almost dark.Talking about good and only good memories.
<P>
As Goku and ChiChi sat outside laughing and talking on their swing chair,Bulma and Vegeta returned."How was your day?" ChiChi asked Bulma politely. Bulma smiled showing her straight teeth."It was fine.And yours?" ChiChi nodded a fine back to Bulma and the four walked inside.As they reached the couch.Vegeta looked over at Goku,"Hey uh Kakorot?" Goku looked over at Vegeta surprised they were actually talking."Yah?" Vegeta clenched his fist but released the grip shortly.He sighed and looked up at his life time enemy,Goku."I would like to be uh.."Vegeta cleared his throat. And began again,"I would like to be life time friends."Vegetas fists cleched again but didn't release,"Instead of enemies.I had hated you because you ruined the pure line of saiyans by marrying a human being!But now I see how you had cared for her.I..I am sorry." Vegeta sat down and was followed quickly by a kiss from Bulma. She smiled up at him and squeezed his hand tightly. Goku looked down and looked up again with a huge smile spread across his face."Thankyou Vegeta." Vegeta smiled up at Goku and quickly returned to Bulma. The two couples sat down and enjoyed a great night,friends and friends.
