<p>This vignette is set after the epilog of "Mythic Descent"...

<p>In another, far better place...

<p>A cool breeze blew from the maroon sea that washed the shores of
the ancient beach, a cool breeze that stirred his hair and filled his
lungs. Bardock stood upon the shore, and Kinoko was with him, her tail
looped around his waist, delicately intertwining with his.

<p>Kinoko caressed his face with a slender hand. *Where are you now,
my love?*

<p>Bardock gently clasped her long fingers with his own, and looked
out across the wine-dark sea at the brilliant white sun sinking toward
the far horizon. Far above, in the darkening sky, a great silvery arch
spanned from one horizon to the other. He looked back into her
eyes. *Kajaio rests in Umiy Moor'asaakye.. I thought never to see this
again. I thought all this was lost.. I thought I was lost.*

<p>*Nothing good is ever lost; it is saved, to be created anew and
perfect.* Kinoko embraced him; Bardock reached up and traced the lines
of her face with equal wonder.

<p>*I remember.. my soul torn apart and remade at the same time...*

<p>His long rebellion in Hell had ended in one terrible moment of
clarity; he couldn't remember, now, what triggered it--Bardock could
only remember that sudden, awful knowledge that everything that had
happened was exactly what he deserved. All the grief and loss he'd
felt as he wiped the blood from his dead friend's face and seen the
broken bodies of the rest of his friends fallen on the field--<i>they</i>
had felt it too, all those <i>people</i> whose friends and families he had
slaughtered on world after world.  The terrible injustice of Frieza's
betrayal, when the Saiyajin had been obedient and done him no
wrong--on countless worlds, <i>they</i> had felt the injustice, when a
people they'd never known nor harmed descended from the skies to
destroy them. Even that final moment, as Frieza's Deathball
overwhelmed Bardock's own powerful attack and he knew that all was
lost, that there was no hope and no future for the Saiyajin, when
despair closed tight around his heart, and death claimed him... <i>they</i>
had known that same moment of despair and death--on Kunnasasei, on
Meatsei, on all the worlds where he'd killed without mercy and without
restraint. He'd seen that look in too many eyes--the same look Frieza
must have seen in his own eyes...

<p>In that awful moment, the full weight of his sins fell on him at last,
and he knew he'd fully earned damnation--and that he and every other
Saiyajin deserved his fate. What they had done, had been done to them,
and done <i>justly</i>.

<p>Only one thing that Bardock hadn't understood.. Why did Frieza's
doom come at the hand of a Saiyajin? Why had they been granted that
gift? Frieza had earned his doom most assuredly, but out of all the
races Freiza destroyed, by what grace were the bloody-handed Saiyajin
granted the gift of vengeance?

<p>He'd found the answer in his grandson's eyes. Little Goten was
half-Saiyajin.. and he was innocent. He'd seen it in his youngest
son's compassionate eyes--Kakarott, full-blooded Saiyajin, and
innocent. More than innocent; compassionate, merciful,
and... loving. Bardock saw what the Saiyajin could have been in
heaven's sight, and knew why they'd been granted that one grace. And
then he looked inside his own heart, and finally knew the truth, <i>all</i>
of the truth about himself. He knew, then, why he'd never gotten over
his grief for Kinoko, why the death of Toma and the rest of his crew
had driven him half-mad with rage and grief, why he'd raged at the
"injustice" of it for so long... Kakarott was not the only Saiyajin
who.. loved.

<p>He'd known friendship and love--even in the depths of Hell. Bardock
did not abandon those he'd died for. And much to his surprise, they
did not abandon him, though he'd failed them, failed in his promise to
Toma. In this Bardock finally saw what far wiser and greater eyes than
his must have seen long ago, what he, Bardock, and all the Saiyajin,
could have been, should have been.. and what they might become.

<p>What they might become? No, that was something he'd not understood
until afterwards.. until he had become what he should have been from
the beginning. After Hell, after that awful understanding of his sins
and the justice dealt to him, after learning that there <i>was</i> good
within him, after.. regret. After knife-keen remorse stabbed through
his heart in an endless agony of wishing that he'd never done so many
things, so many things that obstinately remained DONE, and could not
be undone.

<p>In the end, he wanted only one thing: to be innocent again. And it
was so...

<p>*I remember.. being forgiven.*

<p>*As do I.* She leaned her chin against Bardock's springy black
hair. *None of us were perfect enough.*

<p>*I know.* He looked out at the darkening sky. *There are still so
few of us here...*

<p>*That will change, in time. The road is hard, but we will walk
it--you are not the only one who learned the price of standing still,
my love.*

<p>*But will they be Saiyajin?* Bardock asked, and then wondered if it
really mattered.

<p>She laughed aloud, a delicate musical sound under the indigo
sky. *YOU are not really Saiyajin any more--nor am I. Nor are those
from Earth human! Not here.*

<p>He smiled wryly. *No.. not here. We are spirit and fire--angels?
Better than the demons we once were.* Again he looked from her to the
darkened sea. *But still.. too few.*

<p>She felt his sorrow and his love, and knew the names that echoed in
his heart.. Toma. Celipa. Panboukin. Totepo. Kinoko had known them,
too, and their names resided in her heart.  *They, too, will come
here.. in time. And what is time, here?* A sudden shift: *Have you
been to Earth yet?*

<p>He brightened--more than figuratively, for both the Saiyan spirits
glowed with their own light. Where they stood, there could be no
darkness. *Yes! Kakarott--I still can't think of him as 'Son
Goku'--and his sons do well. As for Raditz...* Bardock smirked.

<p>Kinoko laughed again. *Yes, Raditz is in trouble, isn't he?*

<p>Bardock embraced Kinoko again; their lips met. Mother of his sons,
his lover, his mate, lost heart of his heart found again..
*Yes. Trouble. How can an Earth woman be so.. Saiyan?*

<p>*One thing I have learned here.. we women are not so different no
matter what planet we come from!*

<p>Bardock smiled, a glint of laughter in his eye. *And just as much
of a mystery to men!*

<p>*I do not find Nezumi all that mysterious!* Kinoko laughed. *I
understand her very well indeed, my love.*

<p>*If that is so.. Raditz is doomed.* Bardock grinned.

<p>*Completely. How long before we have another set of grandchildren,
I wonder?*

<p>*Hmmm.. it depends. Sooner if Kakarott and the Prince can keep from
killing each other.* Bardock stared thoughtfully off into the
distance.

<p>*Yes, Prince Vegeta craves that battle, doesn't he?* Kinoko looked
concerned.

<p>*I think it would be better.. if they did not have that battle
yet. They will need the young ones for what will follow...* Bardock
stared into a distance even Kinoko could not see.

<p>*Looking forward again?*

<p>Bardock glanced back at her and smiled. *Yes. I seem to have
a.. gift for it.* Again he stared off into the distance. *If they are
not separated soon...*

<p>*No! Bulma has already suffered that once! And Goku's mate has her
beloved back, to take him from her again--too cruel!* Kinoko held her
long-lost lover close, taking comfort in his presence, knowing that
she would never lose him again.. but remembering the bitter pain of
their long separation.

<p>*It is not in my power, one way or the other--I only look ahead, I
do not, cannot, reach ahead." He closed his eyes, thinking, and opened
them again. *Because of the Chaos demon, Kakarott returned before his
time, and the consequences of that still echo in time. It must, it
will, be set right.* Bardock held her hands and looked into his wife's
dark, distressed eyes. *As you have said, it is a hard path we
walk--but, trust in this: there is good at the end.*

<p>Kinoko leaned against him, and closed her eyes. *I trust. But, oh,
they will know such sorrow before it is done! What comfort can they
find?*

<p>Bardock looked at his wife deliberately, silently, the barest hint
of a smile on his face and thoughts. *Less sorrow than you fear. What
comfort did Raditz and Goten find?*

<p>She looked back at him silently, knowing. *They will need us.*

<p>*And we will be there.* He held her tightly, and the glow surround
them brightened and spread, lighting ground and sea and sky. In the
blazing heart of it, the light became form: two sets of brilliant
white wings extending from and enfolding the two Saiyajin.
