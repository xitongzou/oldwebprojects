 </span>She’s about 500 years old in Dragonball, and her home address is
 FS199644CC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>She
 reads fortunes for a price, or you can face her spooky competitors to win your
 fortune.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>Later
 in Dragonball Z, it is made known that she has the ability to grant special
 leave for the dead to return for approximately one day, as long as there is a
 good reason, such as the world being torn apart by an evil, unstoppable demon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>She convinces King Yama to allow Goku to return to Earth for a day to
 participate in the Tenkaichi Budoukai and to meet his young son Goten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Later she talks King Yama into allowing Vegeta to return from the dead
 as well in order to aid Goku in defeating Buu.<o:p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><b>Babidi</b>&nbsp;
 The son of Bibidi (creator of Buu), he is an ancient sorcerer who comes to
 Earth with Darbura to resurrect Majin Buu, in hopes of ruling the universe with
 his power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>He
 may look weak but has a powerful barrier and good defenses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Buu kills him by grabbing him in a stranglehold, thus preventing Babidi
 from uttering the chant that would re-contain him, and then punching Babidi’s
 head off and vaporizing his body.<o:p>

 - “Bebi”*</b></span></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 Baby was a robotic creature created long ago by the Tuffles, or the Tsufurujin,
 to defend against the Saiyajin race, but they were unable to activate their
 creation as the Saiyajins advanced on their armies and took over the planet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>After somehow escaping the destruction of the planet Vegeta (once known
 as planet Tuffle, or planet Plant in Japanese), many years passed before the
 ancient secret weapon of the Tuffles drifted to Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Dr. Myuu, the last living member of the Tuffle race, found and repaired
 Baby, and finally activated the robot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>A parasitic robot, Baby infests beings by entering through a wound or
 other body opening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Baby then began to assimilate the most powerful beings on planet Earth,
 including Goten, Gohan and Bulma, all of whom he controls even after he leaves
 their body for another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>After assimilating all of humanity except for Mr. Satan and Mr. Buu, he
 finally embodies himself in Vegeta, the most powerful being on Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Upon his return to Earth, Goku duels the robot, but with Baby in
 Vegeta’s body, the creature proves to be too much for Goku to handle and Baby
 easily defeats him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Later, in the heated battle between Oozaru Baby and Super Saiyajin 4
 Goku, Baby is indeed stronger, but Goku is faster, and manages to defeat the
 creature after a lengthy battle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Baby finally aborts Vegeta’s body and attempts to escape in a Capsule
 Corp space ship, but Goku fires a kamehameha at the ship as it leaves the
 orbit, sending both the ship and its robotic occupant into the sun.<o:p>

 A huge filthy competitor in the 21<sup>st</sup> Tenkaichi Budoukai who has not
 washed or brushed his teeth since the day he was born.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He isn’t particularly strong physically, but uses his stench as a
 weapon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>And
 since his opponents need to hold their noses closed, he can attack them more
 easily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>Bacterian
 is 6’8” tall and weighs 435 and ½ lbs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

 Bardock is Goku and Radditz’s father and the only Saiyajin who knew what was
 going to become of planet Vegeta and his people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>While on planet Karnassa, he was cursed with the ability to see the
 future, and saw glimpses of his planet being destroyed, as well as several
 visions of his son’s life on Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He survives a surprise attack from Dodoria and his men who were sent by
 Frieza to take them out before he made his way to planet Vegeta. Dodoria’s
 men killed Bardock’s 4 crewmates, and just before he dies, Toma tells Bardock
 everything that happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Bardock makes quick work of Dodoria’s men, slaughtering all of them
 but Dodoria himself, who thinks he has killed Bardock and heads back to
 Frieza’s ship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Bardock survives and returns to planet Vegeta at top speed, but when he
 gets there no one believes his story or his visions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Alone, the brave warrior Bardock makes a last stand against Frieza and
 tries to kill him, but his attempt is fruitless and he is destroyed by the
 biggest Death Ball Frieza ever created.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>As Bardock dies, he finally realizes that it was not him who is destined
 to defeat Frieza, but his son.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>In the dub, he speaks to his son from the after-life while little
 Kakarot is on his way to Earth, and charges him with the task of killing Frieza
 to avenge his father, and all Saiyajin.<o:p>

 the only part of Cooler that survived being shot into the sun (Movie 5).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

 his job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>He

 a few changes are made to the story, including the way Black is killed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

 can see, he will be frightened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

 human, turns him into a carton of milk, then brings it back to the boy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>They talk a little while longer before they part. The entire scene sets
 you up for a gag because of its design to make the reader think that Buu is
 somewhat reformed after meeting the boy, because in the final panel of the
 manga, Buu happily blows up a nearby city.<o:p>

 defeat and finish Goku.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>As the story goes in Movie 8, the two Saiyajin were born on the same
 day, and were set next to each other in the infirmary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>While Goku’s power level was at about 2, Brolli was born with a power
 level of 10,000! (a power strong enough to take out Nappa).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Despite his weaker power level, Goku’s will makes Brolli cry, an event
 that creates a deep instinctive hatred within Brolli.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>In the movies, Brolli achieves Ultimate Super Saiyajin, and even Super
 Saiyajin 2, while Goku and the others can only reach Super Saiyajin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He isn’t much for conversation, and his favorite word appears to be
 “Kakarotto,” which he repeats and screams quite often throughout every
 movie in which he appears.<o:p>

 King Kai’s “pet” sidekick monkey.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He is used to the gravity on King Kai’s planet, and so can easily
 outrun Goku when he first arrives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>It takes Goku 11 days to catch Bubbles on Planet Kaio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The name Bubbles is a word play after Michael Jackson’s pet monkey.<o:p>

 the very first episode of Dragonball.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

 searches for the Dragonballs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>She is the daughter of Dr. Briefs and is a genius when it comes to
 mechanics and inventing new contraptions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>She invents the Dragon Radar, the Micro Band, and Fighting Jackets, just
 to name a few.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>In Dragonball and early DBZ, Bulma is smitten with Yamcha.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>As the story progresses, she loses interest in him because he is too
 fickle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>About
 the end of the Frieza Saga, she finds herself beginning to fall in love with
 Vegeta, who she realizes is lonely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>By the Trunks Saga it becomes apparent there is something between them,
 and although Vegeta generally denies his feelings, deep down he truly loves
 Bulma.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>They
 have two children, Trunks and Bra.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

 </span>A certified ditz, she is always interested in flirting with Goku and
 Vegeta.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>In
 the anime, she makes a suggestive comment that she would like to go on a date
 with Vegeta (o.O).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Probably the most disturbing feature of this woman is the fact that, as
 far as physical appearances go, she looks AT LEAST as young as her daughter,
 and unlike Bulma, she doesn’t appear to age at all throughout DBZ.<o:p>

 <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><b>Buu</b></span></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 Originally created by the evil sorcerer Bibidi at about 5 million BC, Majin Buu
 was intended to be a magical weapon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He destroyed entire planets one by one in a distant galaxy, and killed
 every Kaioshin but one, the Kaioshin of the East.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Soon he became so powerful that Bibidi could not control him, and so the
 wizard sealed Buu in a magical chamber.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Millions of years later, Bibidi’s son Babidi locates the sphere in
 which Buu is sealed, and after years of searching for a power strong enough to
 break the seal, he eventually resurrects Buu in 774 AD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>At first, Buu obeys Babidi’s orders, mainly because he is aware that
 Babidi knows the password to re-seal him in the chamber again, and so he does
 his bidding until he can absorb enough power to the point that he no longer
 fears Babidi, and finally kills him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Buu later befriends Mr. Satan and reforms himself somewhat, but it is
 only a matter of time before the evil within Buu is released.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>When a few robbers try to kill Mr. Satan, the enraged Buu finally
 explodes in anger and splits into two different personalities, his good and
 evil halves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>His
 evil half undergoes many transformations as he continues to absorb more
 fighters and their special powers, and eventually he kills almost every living
 being on Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Goku and Vegeta fuse into Vegetto, the only single character in DBZ that
 is stronger than Buu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>He allows Evil Buu to absorb him, and once inside of Buu, Vegetto splits
 back into Vegeta and Goku, who rescue the fighters that Buu had absorbed and
 fly back out of Evil Buu’s body, an act which rips away all of Buu’s new
 powers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>Evil
 Buu is so angered at this that he fires a tremendous blast at the Earth that
 destroys the planet!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Just before the planet is destroyed, Goku teleports Vegeta and a few
 others to Namek II, where they continue the battle with Evil Buu while Dende
 reawakens Porunga and wishes Earth to be restored.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Goku is almost equal to Evil Buu at Super Saiyajin 3, but the form
 doesn’t last, and so Goku, Vegeta and Mr. Buu (Buu’s good half) must fight
 to keep Evil Buu busy while Dende wishes that all who had been killed by Buu
 back to life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Vegeta must distract Buu for as long as he can while Goku forms a Genki
 Dama (spirit bomb) using the powers of every single living being on the Earth
 combined.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>After
 Goku finishes the Genki Dama, Dende’s final wish is for Goku to have the
 power to go Super Saiyajin again, so that Goku can fire the huge Genki Dama at
 Evil Buu full-force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>The planet-sized blast completely takes Buu by surprise, and it
 completely destroys Evil Buu once and for all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>At first Vegeta wants to finish Mr. Buu as well, but the others convince
 him that Buu is reformed, and so Mr. Buu is allowed to live in peace, which he
 does with his friend Mr. Satan and his dog Bee, both of which somehow survived
 the entire ordeal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
 </span>Much later, at the end of DBZ, Mr. Buu is living with Mr. Satan, and
 Evil Buu has been reincarnated as a human named Ubuu.<o:p>

 surprisingly strong and has incredible psychic powers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

 Buyon solid.</span></font>
