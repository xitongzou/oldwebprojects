(1) Foreword & Basic Tutorial
-----------------------------
        
        This section  contains the  Foreword, Disclaimer,  and all the
basics that you need to know to become  familiar with the game. If you
have  never played  the game  before, or are  not completely  familiar
with  the game's  mechanics, be  sure to read at least  Sections (1.3)
- (1.4).



(1.1) The Foreword
------------------

     Sick and tired  of all  those  other  OMF moves lists you find on
your local bulletin  boards  or in your  favorite gaming mag that have
move  combinations that  never seem  to work,  or have directions that
are only  slightly  more  comprehensible  than  the  German README.TXT
file you  got with  that  foreign  variation of  Tetris? Does  it seem 
like  someone  forgot  something  vital, like  maybe  "testing",  when
they  uploaded  or  published  those  lists? Are  you  often   finding
yourself  gnashing  your  teeth  when  the computer  performs a lethal
Destruction  on  your  hapless 'bot, while you  can only  desire sweet
vengeance  in  the  form  of  seeing  your  opponent  impaled on  your
Thorn's spikes? Or maybe you  long to wind up and smash the upper body
off the AI's 'bot with  that  wicked  Nova.  Do you mirror a sentiment
all-too-common  among most  people playing  this game?: "How the (your
favorite expletive here) do I DO that?"

     Well,  look no further.  This FAQ  is exactly  the OMF  guide for
your  destructive  pleasure. (Albeit  politically-correct  destructive
pleasure)  All the  combinations for  special  moves  listed  in  this
file  haven't  been  taken  straight from  the $10 strategy guide that
only a pansy  gamer would  buy  from Epic. No,  all  these  codes have
been gleaned  through blood, sweat, and blisters  in the  Arena  after
hours  and hours of heated battle, like a real gamer would--with a few
of the  moves  ripped out of what  passes as  the  current OMF FAQ. So
what does  this mean?  It means that, so  long  as you're not using an
older/updated   version  of  OMF  than  myself,  all the moves  listed
here  (which covers  just about 99.9% of all  moves in the game--to my
knowledge)  are  guaranteed, or your  money  back.  Heck,  maybe I can
swing  a  deal with  the  SysOps to  give you  back your DL  credit if
you're not completely satisfied.
     
     If you  haven't  gotten  the registered version of this game yet,
order it  today. This is, in my opinion, the best fighting game by far
ever produced for MS-DOS computers. The gameplay is  the  best of  any
fighting  game(SF2  &  MK series included)  out  there.  My  only real
quirk with OMF is  its lack  of scrolling   backgrounds,  causing  the
fighting to sometimes feel crowded; and maybe they'll fix  this in the
sequel. Aside  from  that, this game is  killer, and  nearly flawless.
There's more secrets and hidden characters in this game than MK I & II
put together, making for incredible replay  value trying  to find  all
the  hidden  moves, hidden characters, & special enhancements.

     And all  that without  the "blood'n'guts" that  sets off parental
warning  groups. I  won't  speak for  everyone, but  knocking  bolts &
sheets  of  metal from  an  opponent  is every  bit  as  satisfying as
bleeding  your enemy  to death.  Anti-violence  advocates  can't  even
attack  the "Scrap"  and "Destruction"  moves, as  they are not in any
way  connected with  harming real  people(or even  fictitious people).
Ingenious. Epic  Megagames, Rob Elam, Ryan Elam, & all others involved
in the creative process are to be well applauded.

     Hopefully,  this  file  will  be  expanded as any  new  knowledge
about  the  game  comes to my  attention, and  I'll slowly  be able to
fill  in   the  few  gaps  I'm  currently  not  certain  on.  And,  by
downloading  this file, you're  supporting your  friendly neighborhood
FAQ  writer  by making  higher demand  for  these files in the future.
Now don't you feel better about yourself?

     Be sure  and read  through this  entire  section, if  you're  not
completely  familiar with  the game, for basic  gameplay  instructions
and tips.

NOTE: Those of  you only  playing the  shareware  version, look  under
      "Shareware Differences", Section (1.5) for minor changes in some
      of the scraps.

(1.3) Basic Tutorial
--------------------

     #    Each  'bot has  15 basic  Attacks--7 basic Punches, 7 basic
          Kicks,  and 1 Throw  or Grab.  The basic  Punches and Kicks
          are different  in speed & power,  ranging from  weak & fast
          (referred to as "light") to  fairly strong  & fairly  quick
          (referred to  as "medium") to  powerful & slow (referred to
          as "heavy).

          NOTE: Some 'bots have, in  place of Arms or Legs, different
                appendages  that  they  attack with  such as  blades,
                flames, or chains, and  therefore do not have Punches 
                and  Kicks,  but  say,  Punches & Flames or  Blades &
                Kicks.

          -    To perform  a standing  Light Attack,  press  straight
               towards  your  opponent   and  an  Attack  button.  To
               perform  a  standing  Medium  Attack,  just  press  an
               Attack button  without  pressing in any  direction. To
               perform a standing  Heavy Attack, press  straight Away
               from your opponent and an Attack button.

          -    To   perform   a   crouching   Light   Attack,   press
               diagonally   Down  &  Towards  your  opponent  and  an
               Attack button. To  perform a  crouching Medium Attack,
               press straight Down  and an  Attack button. To perform
               a  crouching  Heavy Attack,  press  diagonally  Down &
               Away  from  your  opponent  and  an Attack button. The
               crouching  Heavy Kick is most  commonly referred to as
               a "Sweep".

          -    To perform  an  Air Attack, first  Jump and then press
               an Attack button while your 'bot is in the air.

          -    To perform  a Throw  or  Grab,  get close  beside your
               opponent and  press  Towards  your opponent  and Punch
               at the  same time. This  results in  various  powerful
               attacks  that vary  depending on  the  particular 'bot
               you are using.

     #    To  jump   much   higher  than   you   normally   would  by
          pressing  Up in  any direction,  press Down just before you
          jump.  This makes  for a  jump that  is about twice as high
          and twice as long as a standard jump.

     #    You  can  Block all  of your  opponents  attacks,  with the
          exceptions  of Low Kicks,  Throws,  & the Nova's Earthquake
          Smash, by  pressing and  holding Away  from your  opponent.
          To  block  Low Kicks,  press  diagonally  Down & Away  from
          your opponent.  Note that  when you  are blocking  low, you
          cannot block  air attacks.  Throws can  only be  avoided by
          keeping your  opponent away  using different  attacks or by
          throwing him  first. The  Nova's Earthquake Smash  can only
          be  avoided by  being  in  the air  at the  time  the  Nova
          performs it.

     #    A number of successively landed hits can make your opponent
          dizzy,  making  them  unable  to  defend  themselves  for a
          brief  period  of  time. You can tell how close you or your
          opponent is  to becoming  dizzy by  watching the  Stun Bar,
          directly  beneath your  or your  opponent's  life  bar. The
          Stun Bar  is  lowered  every  time  you  or  your  opponent
          successfully   lands  an   attack.  The   Stun  Bar  slowly
          recharges  when  you  are not  performing  any  attacks. Be
          careful  of attacking  when  your  Stun Bar  is  low  as it
          will not  recharge, making  it easier  for your opponent to 
          get you dizzy.

     #    Special  moves   are   combinations  of  joystick   or  key
          movements  coupled with  attack buttons  to make  your 'bot
          do more  powerful  attacks  such  as  projectiles  or  long
          range    Attacks.    Look    under    Section  (3),    'bot
          Descriptions for a listing of each 'bot's special moves.

     #    Some 'bots  have "Shadow" versions  of their Special Moves.
          These moves  differ from  the simpler versions of the moves
          in  that  they  are  usually  invulnerable to  projectiles,
          faster, and  more damaging. But, they are also usually more
          difficult to perform and usually have longer recovery times
          which  leave  your  'bot  more  open  to attacks  from your
          opponent.

     #    Every 'bot has a Scrap & Destruction Move.

          -    Scrap  Moves  are  performed   immediately  after  you
               defeat  your  opponent  in the  final round.  Wait for
               your  opponent to  fall down  after the  final blow of
               the  match  and  then  keep  performing   your  'bot's
               particular Scrap move, over and over if need be, until
               you see results.

          -    Destruction    Moves    are    performed   during   or
               immediately  following a scrap  move, as is  specified
               for each 'bot in Section (3), 'bot Descriptions.

     #    A  "Combination"  is a  series of  Attacks which  cannot be
          blocked once the first  hit is made.  For example,  jumping
          at your  opponent and hitting  them with a basic air attack
          (Kick  or  Punch)  and  then   immediately  following  that
          Attack with a Sweep  would be a Two-Hit Combo. (That simple
          combo  works with  all 'bots  under all  Characters)  Also,
          bonus  points are  awarded to  your  score  everytime  your
          successfully  perform  a  combo.  For a  list of  effective
          combos for each robot check Section (3), 'bot Descriptions.

     #    For  best results,  I highly  recommend  using a Gravis, or
          other  brand,  Gamepad,  as it's  nearly  impossible  to do
          most  of  the  moves  consistently  on  a  standard  Analog
          joystick, and rather confusing to use the keyboard.



(1.4) Understanding Special Move Sequences
------------------------------------------
     
     In order to properly understand the move descriptions in Section 
(3), refer to these legends.



(1.4)(A) Direction & Attack Buttons Legend
------------------------------------------
                        
                        Your Joystick (preferrably a Gamepad)
                               
                              |
                             \_/

        .--------.       UB   U   UF       .---------------.
        | You're |         \  |  /         | Your opponent |
        |  here  |       B-- P-K --F       |      here     |
        `--------'         /  |  \         `---------------'
                         DB   D   DF

                    UB = Diagonally Up & Back
                    U  = Straight Up
                    UF = Diagonally Up & Forward
                    B  = Straight Back
                    F  = Straight Forward
                    DB = Diagonally Down & Back
                    D  = Straight Down
                    DF = Diagonally Down & Forward

                    Forward means toward your opponent;
                    Back means away from your opponent

                         Attack Buttons
                         --------------
          P  = The Punch button on your Joystick or Keyboard
          K  = The Kick button on your Joystick or Keyboard



(1.4)(B) Special Moves Punctuation Legend
-----------------------------------------

     Move description punctuation in Section (3) should be understood
as follows:

          
          -      =     Signifies moving succintly  from one position
                       on the stick or keyboard to the next.

                       Example:
                                 B-DB-D-DF-F

                       would  mean to  start in  the  straight  Away
                       from your opponent position and smoothly roll
                       downward & then to the straight  Toward  your
                       opponent position. 

          +      =     Used  when a direction and attack button must
                       be pressed at the same time.

                       Example:
                                 D+K

                       would  mean  to  press  Straight  Down & Kick
                       at  the same time. The best way to do this is
                       not  to try and  press the  direction and the
                       button  at  the EXACT same  time, but instead
                       to  first press  the direction  listed,  hold
                       it,   then  press  the  button,  and  release
                       (unless   otherwise  specified).  This  works
                       best   if  you  do  it  in  one  quick motion
                       that   shouldn't  take  up  more  than  1/2 a
                       second.

          ,      =     Press and  release  the  Direction  or Attack
                       button preceding the comma.
                     
                       Example:
                                 D,F+P

                       would be interpreted as pressing & releasing
                       Straight Down, and then immediately pressing
                       Forward and Punch. Incidentally, this is the
                       Scrap Move  for  the Electra, Shredder,  and
                       Chronos.

          An example of a move  using all  three forms of the above
          punctuation is the Shadow's Scrap Move:

                              B,F-UF-U-UB-B+P

               which should be  interpreted as pressing Back, going
               straight to Forward, then  rolling Upward  then Back
               in one succinct  motion and pressing  Punch once you
               have rolled to the straight Back position.

               Additionally, any  move  preceded  by  (jump)  means
               that  the  move must be  performed while in the air,
               and any  move  followed  by  (rep)  means  to repeat
               the  combination  until results  occur. (turn) means
               just  that--turn  around.  And  (grab) means to  get
               right  beside your opponent and press Towards them &
               Punch at the same time. (land) means that you should
               be on the ground before continuing the move. Lastly,
               a  combination  followed by (hold) means to hold the
               last  Direction  and/or  Attack button pressed until
               results occur.



(1.5) Shareware Differences
---------------------------
     
     If you're playing the shareware version of OMF(Version 1.0, not
2.0),  then  refer to the list below for minor changes in the Scraps
and Destructions for these 'bots:

          Jaguar Scrap    =    D,D,D,U,U+P
                 Destruct =    U,D+K
          
          Thorn  Scrap    =    B,B,F,F+P
                 Destruct =    D,U+P

     The  Pyros'  and  Shadow's  Scraps  are  the  same as listed in
Section  (3),  but  I  can't seem to get their Destructions to work.
I'll  update  this  information  as soon as it's received. Also note
that this information is only confirmed in the 1.0 shareware version
of  OMF.  I haven't tried the 1.1 or 2.0 versions, so I cannot vouch
for this to be true in their case.



(1.6) The 2.0 Modem/Network Upgrade
-----------------------------------

     Yes,  Epic  has  finally  released  the  long anticipated, long
overdue  Modem/Network  Upgrade  for  OMF. You can find the file off
the  I'net  and  most  large BBS's under the filename "OMFUP20.ZIP".
On the Internet, you can get the file at:

ftp.aimnet.com/pub/users/lordsoth/omf

     Or,  feel  free  to call my BBS, The Pond - (615) 536-5072, and
download  the  file  on  your  first call free. Go to the Files menu
after  logging  on  and filling out the information and download the
file  "OMFUP20.ZIP".  You  can  also  download the latest version of
this  FAQ  under  the  filename  "MOMFAQXX.ZIP",  where  XX  is  the
version number.(i.e. 10 = 1.0)

     Aside  from  adding  the  option  to  play other OMF'ers over a
modem,   network,  or  serial  link,  and  the  ability  to  record,
playback,  and  save  your  matches, the  2.0  patch also supposedly
fixes  a  variety  of bugs and adds a couple of new secrets into the
game as well. However, despite the laborious(and somewhat elongated)
beta  test  stage, many users have been complaining of faulty and/or
slow  gameplay.  Having  yet  to  thoroughly  encounter any of these
problems  myself, I don't have much advice as of now. However, below
is  a  list of hints that have been in the IPCGaming echo on FidoNet
to make the game run faster/more reliably over the modem.

     -     If  you  have  problems  with  slow gameplay when playing
           between  two  computers  of  differing speeds, try having
           the slower machine call the faster one.

     -     If  you  can't  seem  to  get a proper connection through
           the  built-in  dialer,  try  connecting through your term
           program,  exiting  that  program  without hanging up your
           modem,  and  choosing "Begin! Already Connected" from the
           Modem/Network menu.

     -     Consult  your  modem's  manual  and  find the init string
           recommended for no compression.

     -     Do  a "clean boot" before you start the game.(If you have
           DOS  6.0  or  later,  press  F5  while  it says "Starting
           MS-DOS...";   otherwise,   make  a  bootdisk  without  an
           AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS.)

     That's  all the tips that I've heard up to this point, but more
will  be  added  as I've used the patch more for myself. If you have
any  tips  on  how to make things run a little more smoothly, please
contact  me  as  is  described  in Section (4.4). All information is
appreciated,  and  credit  will  be  given  for all information used
in this FAQ. Thanx in advance...



* (1.7) Recording/Playing Back Matches           
  ------------------------------------

     As  mentioned  above  in  Section (1.6), the 2.0 upgrade of OMF
added  the  ability  to  record and playback matches. This is really
useful  when  you  want  to  savor a particularly successful session
against  a  friend  over  &  over  again, or to prove that, yes, you
really  CAN  do  that 17-hit combo with the Shredder. Unfortunately,
Epic  overlooked  including how to utilize this function in the tiny
section of the HELPME.DOC file devoted to the 2.0 enhancements. But,
thanx  to faithful contributors, it's where everything that you need
to know about OMF generally ends up: here.

     You  can  record  matches one of three ways. First, you can run
OMF  by  typing "OMF REC" to start the game. This will only save the
last match which ran on your computer, be it One Player, Two Player,
Tournament, or a demo, under the filename "LAST.REC". If you prefer,
you  can  specify a filename under which you wish to record the last
fight  by typing "OMF REC yourfile.REC" where "yourfile" is the name
you  wish  to  call the file. If you would rather record ALL of your
fights in a session, you can type "OMF REC SAVE_REC". This will save
all  fights  in  a given session under the filenames "OMF00001.REC",
"OMF00002.REC", etc..

     You  can  playback  your  fights  one of two ways. You can type
"OMF PLAY"  at  the  command  line,  and  it  will play the existing
"LAST.REC"  file if one exists. If you wish to play a specific file,
type  "OMF PLAY yourfile.REC",  where  "yourfile" is the name of the
file you wish to load.

     Now that the option of recording fights is available, feel free
to  upload  examples  of  your  skill  in  action  to  The Pond BBS,
(615) 536-5072,  so  I  can see that you weren't really just pulling
my  flail  about  a  13-hit combo with the Jaguar. It won't take but
less  than  a  minute,  and wouldn't it feel nice to be believed for
once?  In  the OMF area, you can find several examples of the combos
and  strategies  that  I  detail in this FAQ for you to download and
see for yourself if you won't take my word for it. :)



* (1.8) Understanding Rehit Mode
  ------------------------------

     Rehit  Mode is an option within the Hidden Advanced Option menu
See  Section  2.2)  which,  when  activated,  makes for a completely
different  gaming experience. What it does, basically, is admit that
just  because you've knocked your opponent into the air doesn't mean
that  they're  magically protected from all harm until they stand up
and  come  at  you  again. It allows you the option of continuing to
bash  your  opponent  before they hit the, keeping them airborn with
hits. This is referred to as "juggling". However, as it would be all
too simple to merely keep hitting your opponent over & over with the
same  light punch till all their energy was drained, the programmers
added  this  limitation: Once you've knocked the other 'bot into the
air, you can only hit them once with each  of your Attacks. In other
words,  say  you're  using  the  Shredder and do a Head-Butt on your
opponent, and quickly do a Standing Heavy Punch. These will connect.
However,  if  you  try to do ANOTHER Heavy Punch before they fall to
the  ground,  it  will  pass  through them without doing any damage.
But  you  could,  if you wanted, still do any other attack which you
hadn't  done to your opponent since they became airborn.(Including a
Head-Butt,  since  that was the move that only KNOCKED them into the
air--you  hadn't  hit  them  with  one  of those since they left the
ground)

     Keep this in mind when making up your own combinations for each
'bot.  For  an example of how to use this to it's maximum potential,
look  under  Section (3.7) at the Shredder's 18-hit combo. Effective
use  of your attacks in Rehit mode is a requisite to becoming a much
more  formidable  adversary.(Like  this  is  a really SERIOUS thing,
right? Pardon me while I go pour cold water down my back.)



(2) Known Secrets & Hidden/Unranked Challengers
-----------------------------------------------
     
     OMF is just  loaded  with tons of Hidden  Characters for you to
stumble across, as well as several other hard to discover surprises.
Here's  a  list  of everything I've found and been informed of up to
this point.



(2.1) The Hidden Difficulty Levels
----------------------------------
     
     To get to the not-so-secret-by-now  difficulty level, "Deadly",
go into the  Gameplay menu  accessed  from the Main menu. Go down to
the "CPU:" selection, and keep pressing right after it says Champion
(about 10-15 times) until it turns to "Deadly". This is a level that
you  have to  totally  rely on  taking  advantage of AI bugs to win,
because the computer almost  always blocks all standard  attacks and
projectiles. The  computer  will  also occasionally  do  a  Scrap or
Destruction  after defeating  you. Note  that this  skill level only
affects  One Player  Mode and  Demo Mode,  where the  computer 'bots
fight each  other with  the same  skill that they use against you in
One  Player  Mode, and  sometimes do  Scraps & Destructions  on  one
another.

     And,  if  you  want  the  ultimate  challenge,  why not use the
"Ultimate"  skill  level?  Yes, you know you're bad and can beat the
game  every  time  you  play  it with the CPU level on "Deadly", but
you've  never faced a challenge unless you've played the game on the
SECOND  hidden  skill  level, "Ultimate". To activate "Ultimate", go
into  the  Gameplay  Menu, change the present CPU level to "Deadly",
as  described  above,  and  press  the  keys  O-M-F on your keyboard
simultaneously(in  any  order  just  so  long as you press all three
keys  at  the same time). Release them, and then press Right on your
joystick  or  the  Right  cursor  key  to  change the skill level to
"Ultimate".  I  won't  describe how hard it is to win at this level;
let's just leave it at "Good Luck".



(2.2) The Hidden Advanced Options Menu
--------------------------------------

     There is a hidden option within the game which lets you control
aspects  of  gameplay such as how high the players jump and how much
energy  each  player has in One & Two Player modes, special features
like rehitting and block damage, and several others. To bring up the
menu,  hold  down  the  2-0-9-7  keys on the keyboard simultaneously
while at the Main Menu. Release them, and go into the Gameplay menu.
You'll see a new option accessible called "Advanced Options". Select
it,  and you'll have control over the aforementioned options as well
as  a  few  others  that  I'll  let  you  discover  & figure out for
yourself.  Be aware that once you've played the game with Rehit mode
turned on, you'll probably never turn it off again.



(2.3) Unranked Challengers - Tournament
---------------------------------------
     
     There are  numerous  hidden Unranked Challengers to be found in
the  Tournament Mode. To  get to many  of the hidden characters, you
need to have chosen one of  the two  highest  difficulty levels when
you made your character. Some are only  accessible  at  the  highest
difficulty  level. Also,  you must  usually either perform very well
in  your  previous  fight (take little damage),  perform  a  Scrap &
Destruction, or  both. The  following is a list  of the Characters I
have  been able to find and how I  got to them. 
     
     Once  again,  if  you  don't  seem  to  be  able  to  get  to a
particular  challenger, make  sure that the difficulty level is high
enough;  if  you  still can't get to them, try to take little damage
and  execute  a  destruction every  time,  as  some UCs require this
before they'll challenge you.

     In  the  list  below, note that a "$" before the UCs name means
that  I've  received  an enhancement from that character after doing
a  Destruction  on them. Also, whether or not you get an enhancement
from these seems to be dependent on the skill level you chose.

(2.4) Tournament Mode Enhancements
----------------------------------
     
     You  can  pick  up  enhancements  in Tournament play which will
give  your  'bot  extra  powers, such as multiple projectiles or the
ability  to  perform  special  moves  in  mid-air.  Enhancements are
attained  only when you have your character's difficulty level at at
least  STEEL(I've  never gotten an enhancement at a level lower than
that)  in  Tournament  Play.  I  have only gotten enhancements after
performing  destructions  on  my  opponents.  You  most often get an
enhancement after fighting an Unranked Challenger, but I have gotten
them  after  defeating  #1 ranked in both the Katushai Challenge and
World  Championship.  You'll  know if you've received an Enhancement
by  reading  what  your Engineer says when he greets you. If he says
something  about  finding  a  gizmo  in  the  Arena  while they were
cleaning  up,  then  you've  got  an  enhancement.  But enhancements
usually  won't  do any good unless you know you have them, so always
be  sure to at least glance at the Engineer's comment. For a listing
of  known  enhancements for each 'bot and how to perform them, check
Section (3), 'bot Descriptions.



(2.5) Fire in the Hole, Ice in the Basement
-------------------------------------------
     
     In  One  Player  Mode,  all the 'bots(I believe) have a special
combination  used  to  get  to  the  secret  character  "Fire" after
performing  a  Scrap  &  Destruction  in  the  Fire Arena.  The only
requirement  for  being able to get to Fire is that you have the CPU
difficulty  level on a minimum of "Champion". Known combinations for
some  'bots  are  listed  in  the  'bot  Descriptions,  Section (3).
Fire  is  a  Katana  with  the  ability  to  perform  a 5-hit Rising
Blade  move  and has a Fire projectile that does enormous damage. He
has  extremely high strength & stamina, and relatively high agility.
All  his  hits take off about double the average character's hit. He
doesn't,  however,  seem to be well adept at blocking Sweeps. Defeat
him  in Champion mode, and you'll get 1,000,000 points for a perfect
round(if you can),  1,000,000  for  full  stamina(automatic  perfect
round),  and  1,000,000  for  his Destruction. In Deadly mode, count
that  a  cool  1,500,000  points each. While playing with the CPU on
Ultimate, you get a huge 2,000,000 points each.

     All  psyched  up  and  ready to take on Fire? Well, on the slim
chance  that  you  manage  to defeat Fire with the difficulty set on
Ultimate,  you  can ALSO get to a second hidden character named Ice.
To  get  to  him(or  her--it  COULD  be  a girl), beat Fire with the
difficulty  level set to Ultimate, as is described in Section (2.1),
&  perform a Destruction on him. Then perform the same sequence that
you  used  to  get to Fire. If you do it correctly, you will then be
taken to the lair of the secret character, Ice. Ice is an incredibly
fast,  powerful, and smart Shadow that blocks almost everything that
you  can throw at it. All his(her) Special Shadow Moves go lightning
quick  and  are  unstoppable.  He  also has a Freeze Blast that will
freeze you for a short time, as well as do some damage to you in the
process.(You  might want to remember that to avoid the Freeze Blast,
you  either have to jump or block low) Put quite frankly, it takes a
heck  of  a  lot of effort to beat this guy(gal), so the programmers
were at least gracious enough to give you 20,000,000 points for full
health,  as  well  as  for  a Perfect Round(Yeah Right...) and Ice's
Destruction,  adding up to the Potential of 60,000,000+ points for a
single round. Sound like fun? Go ahead, then. Have fun... losing.



(2.6) Odds'n'Ends Secrets
-------------------------

     - To change the colors of your 'bot in either One or Two Player
       modes, first select the character that you wish to use. While
       you're  choosing  your 'bot, press the 1, 2, & 3 keys on your
       keyboard  to select the colors for Player One and the 4, 5, &
       6  keys  for Player Two. Don't know how secret that is, but I
       thought it worth mentioning anyway.

     - To  replay  the animations shown when you win a tournament in
       Tournament  Mode, press the "E" key on your keyboard from the
       Tournament  Mode  menu.  Remember,  you  have  to  have WON a
       tournament  previous to this, and must not be in a tournament
       at the time. This is a good way to see the winning animations
       for  all  the  'bots, as it will still show the ending if you
       buy  a  different  'bot.  So,  if  you  can't  beat the World
       Championship  tournament  with  that  #%$@& Chronos, then win
       with your favorite 'bot, buy a Chronos if he's available, and
       press  the  "E"  key.  Now you get to watch the pretty little
       grafix animations for ALL those 'bots you're lame with.

     - To  make  all  the  nuts and bolts that you and your opponent
       knock  out  of each other continually rain down on you during
       your  match  without disappearing, hold down the R-E-I-N keys 
       on  your  keyboard  simultaneously  at  any time while in the
       game,  even  during  a  fight.  This  feature is more or less
       useless, and in a long fight slows down  the grafix on even a
       high-end  486  drastically,  but it's there, nonetheless, for
       you to try at least once to quench your insatiable curiosity.
       And  I'm not sure, but this seems to no longer work as of the
       2.0 upgrade of OMF.

     - To increase the amount of metal and bolts that fly from each
       'bot  during a battle, hold down the B-I-G keys along with a
       number  between  1  and  9 simultaneously at any time in the
       game(including  during  a  fight).  1  represents the normal
       amount  of scrap knocked from a 'bot during a fight, whereas
       9  is  the  maximum  amount  of  scrap you can knock from an
       opponent.  To get the scrap level back to normal once you've
       changed it, just press the B-I-G-1 keys simultaneously. Note
       that on some computers(namely MY 486DX2/66), this option for
       some  reason won't work, as every time I try it, I only hear
       my  PC  speaker  chirping  in  the  background.  This may be 
       attributable  to my particular setup, because the code works
       fine on my brother's 486DX2-50, but I'm not sure.

     - You  can  access  a  Sound  Test option available within the
       Configuration  menu  by pressing ALT+S+F simultaneously from
       the main menu,  and  then going into the Configuration menu.
       This  provides  you  with  a  way to listen to all the games
       sound effects individually. Why you'd want to, I don't know;
       but it's there, nonetheless.



(2.7) At Wit's End?
-------------------
     
     If  worse  comes  to  worse,  try  out the OMF Edit program, by
Legend.  No,  it's  not  a source code hack program--it simply edits
your  saved  Tournament  characters  to  give  them  full  power  on
everything,  along  with  over  $672,000,000k  to spend. Look for it
under  the  filename "OMFEDT.ZIP" or "OMFED10.ZIP" on your local BBS
or on the Internet at:

        ftp.aimnet.com/pub/users/lordsoth/omf

     It  works  with either the Shareware or Registered version, but
the version I have will not modify a character using any other 'bots
than  those  contained  in  the Shareware version. However, once you
have  the  $672,000,000k,  you can buy any 'bot you want, as well as
modify it to full strength, endurance, and speed many times over.



(2.8) Built-in Pilot Attribute Editor
-------------------------------------

     If  you have version 2.0 of OMF, registered or shareware, you
try  this  nifty little trick to configure the attributes of the 8
pre-set  characters in One Player, Two Player, or Modem Play modes
to  your  own particular preferences. To access this option, do as
follows:

While  choosing  your pilot, move to Crystal(or you  can obviously
start  from  there),  and  then from there, go five spaces  to the
left to bring you back to Crystal once again. Then, move  down one
space  to  Jean  Paul. From there, move five spaces to the  right,
bringing  you  back  to  Jean Paul. From here, go to the character 
you  wish  to  use  and  press  & hold down the Kick button. While
holding  the  Kick  button, press in the four principal directions
(up, down, left, right)  on  your  gamepad  or  keyboard to modify
their attributes as desired.

     Note  that  you  cannot  ADD  energy  to  any  of  the  three
attributes,  but only "swap out", taking energy from the other two
as  you  increase one. This is pretty much only useful if you ever
wanted  to use Shirro or Ibraham and have them be as fast and weak
as Milano. Not very useful, but I thought you'd want to know.

     Once  again,  note  that  this  ONLY works in version 2.0(and
possibly later versions) of OMF.



(2.9) Using the Nova in One/Two/Modem Player Modes
--------------------------------------------------

     If  you  have version 2.0(or possibly higher versions), there
is  a  way  for  you  to access the Nova in all the aforementioned 
modes.  To  do  so,  do  the  following sequence EXACTLY as listed
when  at  the  'bot selection screen in One Player, Two Player, or
Modem Play modes:

Move  the  cursor  to  the Thorn. From here, move Right 2, Down 1,
Left 3,  Up 1,  Right 1, Left 2, Down 1, Up 1, Down 1. This should
land  you  on  the  Katana.  Now  press down at LEAST 10 times.(It
doesn't  hurt  to  press  more  than this, but this is the minimum
that's required) Now,  move  to the Flail and press Punch or Kick.
(Note  that  you don't  have to go STRAIGHT to the Flail--it won't
hurt if you move to  several other 'bot's first)  Tada! You're the
proud pilot of a mighty Nova.

     You can pretty much use most of the same strategies listed in
Section  (3.B) when using the Nova in One Player mode. These prove
more  than effective enough at obliterating the computers attempts
to  overcome  those incredible skills of yours. Smash things. Make
stuff explode. Have fun.

     Again,  remember  that  this will NOT work on versions 1.0 or
1.1 of OMF, and only works with the registered version.



(2.A) Questions -I- Need Answered
---------------------------------

     At present, I'm pretty sure the following things are possible,
but have yet to learn how to do them. Please contact me through one
of  the  ways  detailed in Section (4.4) with information regarding
any  of  these  listed items if you possess it. It would be greatly
appreciated,  and  credit  will be given to those who contribute in

(3) 'bot Descriptions, Moves, & Other Swell Stuff
-------------------------------------------------

     The following  list is a  compilation of Descriptions, Special
Moves,  Scrap  &  Destruction  Moves,  Combos,   Known  Secrets,  &
Miscellaneous  Notes for each 'bot. If you want to print out a list
of  all  the  'bots  moves, but don't want to have to print all the
extra  stuff,  print  the  "OMFMOVES.LST"  file  that came with the
"MOMFAQXX.ZIP" file.(where XX is the version number)

     Also, note that most of the combos listed in the "Combos" list
for  each  'bot are done with Rehit mode turned on. For information
on how to turn this on, see Section (2.2).


----------------------------------------------------------------------

(3.1) Jaguar
------------

Description: 

 Fast  & fairly powerful, the Jaguar's a good basic choice for most
players  to learn on. All its Special Moves are very basic and easy
to  execute,  and  it's  Scrap  &  Destruction  are best to use for
learning  how  the  timing  of  most Scraps & Destructions work. It 
does, however, have slow recovery time from its Sweep and Uppercut,
leaving  it  open to quick attacks by the enemy. A very all-around,
but   not  specialized when unmodified,  'bot that's great to learn
the mechanics of the game with. However, if you have a fully-rigged
Jaguar  with  both Enhancements in Tournament mode, this rig rocks!
When  playing  with Rehit mode turned on, the Jaguar is my personal
preference to beat the living cyber-shnot out of my opponents with.
With  a  souped  up  Jag,  you  can take off nearly a third of your
opponents  energy  with  a  single  combo. However, should you be a
little  slow  in the finger movement category, don't expect to reap
too  many  benefits  here.  But  seeing  your  friend  gawk  as you
completely  destroy  their pride'n'joy in a matter of seconds makes
it well worth your while to take a course in "Reflex Enhancement".


Special Moves:

     Jaguar Leap              =    D-DF-F+P
     Shadow Jaguar Leap       =    B-DB-D-DF-F+P  
     Concussion Cannon        =    D-DB-B+P
     Overhead Throw           =    (jump), D+P - when near opponent

     Scrap Move               =    D,D,U+P
     Destruction Move         =    D,U+K
                                   Timing: Time   it   so  that  you
                                   press  U+K right after the Jaguar
                                   lifts your opponent overhead.

     How to get to Fire & Ice =    U,D+K
                                   Timing: Do it right after the Jag
                                   throws  your opponent through the
                                   floor.


Hyper Mode Enhancements:

Directable Concussion Blast  -     Lets  you  direct the Blast after
                                   you  shoot  it by pressing in any
                                   direction.
                                   Combination: Same as normal CB

Mid-Air Jaguar Leap          -     Lets  you  perform  a Jaguar Leap 
                                   while jumping.
                                   Combination: (jump),D-DF-F+P


Tournament Enhancements:

First Enhancement:
This Enhancement's a doozy.. It gives you all of the following:

Double Concussion Blast      -     Lets  you  shoot  two  Blasts  at
                                   once.  It  needs to be noted that
                                   when  up  close to your opponent,
                                   this  will  shoot  THREE  blasts,
                                   instead   of   the   normal  two,
                                   amounting to extra damage.
                                   Combination: Same as normal CB

Mid-Air Jaguar Leap          -     Lets  you  do  the Jaguar Leap in
                                   mid-air, even  if  Hyper  Mode is
                                   off.
                                   Combination: (jump),D-DF-F+P

Double Jaguar Leap           -     Lets   you   do  two  consecutive
                                   Jaguar Leaps, one right after the
                                   other.  To  do  it,  do a regular
                                   Jaguar Leap, then perform another
                                   one  before your Jaguar starts to
                                   fall  out of the leap. This works
                                   great  for  extra  damage to your
                                   opponent   when   rehit  mode  is
                                   turned on.

Shadow Jaguar Leap           -     This  lets  you  do a kick coming
"Safety" Kick                      out  of  a  SJL, which means that
                                   you  won't  be  vulnerable to any
                                   quick  attacks from your opponent
                                   if  you  miss with the SJL. To do
                                   the  "safety" kick, perform a SJL
                                   and press the Kick button anytime
                                   during  the  SJL before you start
                                   to fall out of it. This one works
                                   great  with  rehit mode turned on
                                   as  well,  since  the more damage
                                   you  can  fit  into  a combo, the
                                   happier your 'bot'll be.

Second Enhancement:
I  played  through  all  four tournaments with the Jaguar, and while
the first enhancement could be obtained from many different Unranked
Challengers, the only place I could ever find the second enhancement
was  from  Bethany in the World Championship. It's worth it, though,
as you'll see from the following two nifty Enhancements.

Triple Concussion Blast      -     Shoots  three Blasts at a time.
                                   Just  like  the  DCB, if you're
                                   right  next to an opponent when
                                   you do this move, the number of
                                   shots   fired   will  be  FOUR,
                                   instead of the normal THREE.
                                   Combination: Same as normal CB

Mid-Air Jaguar Leap          -     Lets   you  perform  an  overhead   
"Safety" Throw                     throw  when coming out of a MAJL.
                                   This  is  really most useful with
                                   Rehit   mode   turned  on  as  an
                                   offensive   move,   but  is  also
                                   effective  as a defensive move so
                                   you're  not  as  vulnerable  when
                                   coming out of a MAJL.
                                   Combination: Press   D+P  at  any
                                   time  while doing a MAJL previous
                                   to  the  apex(the  point at which
                                   you start to fall downward).


Effective Combos:

- My Best Combo, 8-hit Tournament -
Modes: Tournament     Req'd: Both Enh
Combination: (jump)+K,(land),D-DB-B+P,D-DF-F+P,D-DF-F+P,D+P

continue  with  Double Jaguar Leaps, and finish with Safety Overhead
Throw.
Difficulty(1-10): 6
   
- One/Two Player Killer 3-hit -   
Modes: One/Two Player     Req'd: Fast Pilot
Combination: (grab),(turn),F+P,D-DF-F+P
Description: Do  the  Jag's  grab,  turn  around and juggle opponent
with a light Standing punch, finish with a Jaguar Leap.
Difficulty(1-10): 3

- Awesome Damage 5-hit -
Modes: Tournament,Modem     Req'd: Both Enh, Fast Pilot
Combination: (grab),(turn),F+P,D-DF-F+P,D-DF-F+P,D+P
Description: Same  as  the  above  combo, but using the Enhancements
for an extra Jaguar Leap followed by the Safety Overhead Throw.
Difficulty(1-10): 4 

- Quick-Dizzy 7 or 8-hit -
Modes: Tournament     Req'd: First or Both Enh
Combination: (jump)+K,(land),D-DB-B+P,B-DB-D-DF-F+P,K
Description: Attack  with  a  Jump  Kick,  follow  with a Concussion
Blast.  Continue  with  a  Shadow  Jaguar  leap, and end with an SJL
Safety Kick. Great for dizzying your opponents.
Difficulty(1-10): 4


Computer Cheats:

   -   The  computer  almost  never  blocks  the  Double  or  Triple
       Concussion  Blast  when  you  do  it immediately after a Jump
       Attack.

   -   The  computer is also a sucker for the Jaguar Overhead Throw.
       Just  jump  at  your  opponent, and wait till the last second
       before  doing  the throw. This works best against the Flail &
       Pyros.


Human/Human sTrAgEdIeS:

   -   The  Shadow  Jaguar  Leap  is  great  to  use  against  Human
       opponents  in  Tournament  mode  if  you  have  at  least one
       Enhancement.  Use  it  to  attack from long range by pressing
       Kick  about  mid-way  through the SJL. This often as not will
       catch  your  opponent  off-guard  the  first couple of times,
       and  not  much  after  as  they'll  be  ready  for it. Use it
       sparingly.

   -   Be  sure  to  utilize  the  Jaguar's  uppercut  for thwarting
       Jump  Attacks  from  your  enemy.  When  timed  right, it can
       almost  always  knock  away  most  basic Jump Attacks without
       costing you any damage.

   -   A  good  way  to  "tick"  your  opponent is to continually do
       the  Shadow  Jaguar  Leap-Safety  Kick  move  over  and over.
       Remember,  this  requires  at least the first Enhancement, so
       it will only work in Tournament or Modem modes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

(3.2) Shadow
------------

Description:

Quick  & fairly powerful, the Shadow is one of the easiest 'bots in
the  game  to  win  with.  Using  a combination of AI flaws & quick
moves,  you  can easily beat the computer on the hardest difficulty
level  almost every time. The computer cannot(in my version) hardly
ever  avoid  the  Shadow  Grab  once  it's thrown, with the notable
exception  of the Electra on the higher difficulty levels. The best
strategy  to  catch  the  computer  with the Shadow Grab is to make
distance between you and your computer opponent, and then throw the
Shadow Grab. Also, performing a Shadow Dive while jumping away from
a  computer opponent connects most of the time, even on the highest
difficulty  settings. However, the Shadow Punch and Shadow Kick are
virtually  useless  against the game's AI--unless you find yourself
cornered  by  a computer opponent. Due to another AI flaw, when you
are  cornered,  about 95% of the time you can perform a Shadow Kick
with  the  computer  at  close  range  and  it will not be blocked.
(provided  you  are using a mid-to-fast speed character) The Shadow
is definitely the 'bot to use to find most of the games secrets, as
a  skilled player can almost always get a perfect, or at least near
to perfect, round with it.


Special Moves:

     Shadow Punch             =    D-DB-B+P
     Shadow Slide             =    D-DB-B+K
     Shadow Dive              =    (jump),D-DF-F+P
     Shadow Grab              =    D,D+P

     Scrap Move               =    B,F-UF-U-UB-B+P
     Destruction Move         =    D,D,D+P
                                   Timing: Do it quickly right after
                                   the  sixth  hit  of the Scrap. If
                                   you  have  problems getting it to
                                   work,   keep  hitting  D+P  right
                                   after the fifth hit of the Scrap.

     How to get to Fire & Ice =    D,D,D+P
                                   Timing: Do  it  right  after  the
                                   giant    Shadow   destroys   your
                                   opponent. If  you can't get it to
                                   work,  try pressing  D+P  over  &
                                   over after the big Shadow smashes
                                   your opponent.


Hyper Mode Enhancements:

None known.


Tournament Enhancements:

First Enhancement:
Air Shadow Grab              -    Lets  you  throw  the  Shadow Grab
                                  in Mid-Air. 
                                  Combination: (jump),D-DB-B+P

Second Enhancement:
Super Shadow Punch & Kick    -    Faster,  More Powerful versions of
                                  the Shadow Punch & Kick.
                                  Combination: Same  as normal SP/SK

   Freeze Blast              -    A  projectile  weapon that freezes
   NOTE: You  can  only get       your opponent doing some damage in
   the  Freeze Blast if you       the  process, and holds them for a
   get your second enhance-       few   seconds,   giving   you  the
   ment  from Iceman in the       opportunity to do more damage. 
   North American.                Combination: F-DF-D-DB-B+P


Effective Combos:

- My Best Combo, Unlimited-Hit Instant Death -
Modes: One,Two,Modem,Tournament     Req'd: Rehit, Dizzy, Fast Pilot
Combination: D-DB-B+K,(rep)
Description: Note  that  this  only works against the Pyros, Katana,
Flail, & Gargoyle. To get it to work, get your opponent dizzy & in a
corner.  Launch  repeated  Shadow  Slides. They will continue to hit
your  opponent as long as they are timed correctly. It is easiest to
do  against the Katana, as it falls at a rate about equivalent to as
fast as you can do the Shadow Slides.
Difficulty(1-10): 8

- Powerful Ground Based 5-hit -
Modes: Tournament     Req'd: Fast Pilot
Combination: (jump)+K,DB+P,DB+P,DB+P,DB+K
Description: Jump  at  your  opponent  with a Jump Kick, follow with
three  Croucing  Heavy  Punches,  and finish with a Sweep. Great for
performing  when  your  opponent  is almost dizzy. Since it's ground
based,  whether  they're  about  to  be dizzy or not they won't fall
until you finish the combo.
Difficulty(1-10): 1

- Dizzying 4-hit -
Modes: Tournament     Req'd: Rehit, Fast Pilot
Combination: (jump)+K,B+K,B+K,D-DB-B+K
Description: Jump at your opponent with a Jump Kick, follow with two
Standing Heavy Kicks, and finish with a Shadow Slide. This takes off
substantial amounts from your opponent's stun bar.
Difficulty(1-10): 4


Computer Cheats:

   -   When  playing  with  the  Shadow  in  One/Two/Modem Player or 
       Tournament  modes,  there  is a bug in the game that will let
       the  Shadow  win  infallibly  every time provided you can get
       your  opponent dizzy once. Once they're dizzy, throw a Shadow
       Grab. Notice sparks CONTINUE to fly from the 'bot being held.
       Jump  in  and  do  any ground-based combo you like. When your
       opponent  gets  up  again,  he  will  still  be  dizzy.  Keep
       repeating  the process until the match is over. Kind of lame,
       but  when you're hard up for a win, feel free to try it. Note
       that this only works if you've upgraded your OMF to 2.0.

   -   If  you're  ever  backed  into a corner by the computer, this
       works  almost  always  without  fail.  Wait  until they're at
       about  sweep  range,  and then do a Shadow Slide. They almost
       never  block  this,  and  it  backs them off, giving you some
       breathing room.

   -   In  the  2.0  upgrade,  they made it much harder to catch the
       computer  with the Shadow Grab. However, it can still be done
       quite  often  by  first  launching  a  Shadow  Grab, and then
       quickly launch a Shadow Punch. This will sometimes knock your
       opponent  into  the  Shadow  Grab,  adding  up for more bonus
       damage.

   -   The  computer  is  also quite stupid in regards to the Shadow
       Dive. About 50% of the time, you can hit the computer with it
       by  jumping  away and quickly doing one before you reach your
       jump's apex.


Human/Human sTrAgEdIeS:

   -   The  easiest  way  to  beat your organic opponents is to keep
       them  off balance using the Shadow's Shadow Dive & Shadow Air
       Grab(only available with 1st Enh.) as often as possible. Your
       best  shot at catching a skilled friend with a Shadow Grab is
       to wait for them to jump at you & THEN throw it, jumping away
       to  avoid  their incoming attack. The Shadow dive is best put
       to  use  when  jumping  away from an opponent. This gives you
       space from your opponent even if it doesn't connect.

   -   Due  to  the  fact  that your friends will be looking for the
       Shadow  to  "phase"  out  and  launch another Punch or Slide,
       it's  best  to  use  these  only  when it can safely be done.
       When  an  opponent  jumps  at  you, a late Shadow Punch works
       surprisingly  well. When cornered, a Shadow Slide is good for
       getting  enemies  farther  away, whether it hits or not. Just
       remember  that the most important thing when using the Shadow
       is  not  to  become predictable. If you adhere to any pattern
       long enough, you'll lose in the long run. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

(3.3) Thorn
-----------

Description:

     Stout would best describe the Thorn's fighting prowess. Able to
take  ungodly  amounts  of  damage  without  flinching,  having some
of  the  most  damaging  moves  in the game, and yet painfully slow,
the  Thorn  is  definitely  to  OMF  what  Zangief  is to the Street
Fighter  II  series,  to give you an idea. However, despite his lack
of   speed,   the   damage   the  Thorn  causes  with  every  attack
(particularly  his  Speed  Kick)  &  extremely tough armor more than
make  up  for  one  or  two extra hits your opponent may land. That,
and  a  couple of AI flaws in One Player & Tournament Mode, make the
Thorn quite easy to win the game with on any difficulty level.


Special Moves:

     Speed Kick               =     D-DF-F+K
     Shadow Speed Kick        =     B-DB-D-DF-F+K
     Spike Charge             =     F,F+P
     Off-the-Wall Attack      =     (jump against wall),DF+K

     Scrap Move               =     B,B,F+P
     Destruction Move         =     U,D+P
                                    Timing: Do  it  right after your
                                    opponent has been "spiked".

     How to Get to Fire & Ice =     U,U,D+P
                                    Timing: Do the combination right
                                    after your opponent goes through
                                    the floor. If you have problems,
                                    do  the move over & over as soon
                                    as  you've  done the Destruction
                                    sequence.


Hyper Mode Enhancements:

Mid-Air Speed Kick           -     Lets  you  do  a Speed Kick while
                                   in the air.
                                   Combination: (jump),D-DF-F+K


Tournament Enhancements:

First Enhancement:
Super Fast Spike Charge      -     Spike  Charge is incredibly fast.
                                   Combination: Same as normal SC
         &

Mid-Air Speed Kick           -     Lets  you do a Speed Kick in mid-
                                   air without Hyper Mode on.
                                   Combination: (jump),D-DF-F+K

Second Enhancement:
After playing through all Tournaments using the Thorn, the only
place I ended up being able to get the Thorn's Second Enhancment
was from Devan Shell in the World Championship.

Mid-Air Off-the-Wall Attack  -     Lets  you  do the Thorn's Off-the
                                   Wall Attack  from anywhere in the
                                   air.
                                   Combination:(jump),D-DB-B+K

* Double Speed Kick          -     Lets  you do two Speed Kicks, one
                                   after  the  other. To do it, just
                                   do  a  normal SK, then do another
                                   one  before  the  Thorn starts to
                                   fall.


Effective Combos:

- My Best Combo, Ultimate Destruction 5-hit -
Modes: Tournament     Req'd: Rehit, Both Enh, Fast Pilot, Dizzy
Combination: (jump),D-DF-F+K,(land),DB+P,D+P-DF-F+K,D-DF-F+K
Description: Do  a  Mid-Air  Speed-Kick, placing it so that you land
right  in  front of where your opponent was standing. as soon as you
land,  do  a  Crouching  Heavy  Punch followed by a Crouching Medium
Punch.  Finish  with a Double Speed Kick. This does more damage than
any  combo  under  9 hits that I've been able to find with any 'bot,
and is extremely simple to perform with practice. You CAN do it even
if your opponent isn't dizzy, but you won't be able to finish it.
Difficulty(1-10): 4

- Simple & Destructive 2-hit -
Modes: One,Two,Modem,Tournament     Req'd: Rehit
Combination: (jump),D-DF-F+K,(land),D-DF-F+K
Description: Follows  a  Mid-Air  Speed Kick with a Speed Kick. This
works  great  when  using a strong character like Shirro in One/Two/
Modem  Player  modes.  If  you're playing in Modem mode with Level 2
Enhancements,  then  tack on another Speed Kick right after the last
one for incredible damage.
Difficulty(1-10): 1

- Smash'n'Toss 2-hit -
Modes: One,Two,Modem,Tournament     Req'd: Rehit, Fairly Fast Pilot
Combination: (jump),D-DF-F+K,(land),F,F+P
Description: Follows  a Mid-Air Speed Kick with a Spike Charge. Good
for  keeping  your opponent off-balance by making them switch sides,
and  does  large amounts of damage in One/Two/Modem Player modes. It
requires just a little bit of timing to get right.
Difficulty(1-10): 2


Computer Cheats:

   -   The computer almost always fails to block the Thorn's Mid-Air
       Speed  Kick.  Use it as often as you like, and it will nearly
       never  be  blocked.  Also,  in Tournament mode with both Enh,
       start  off  every  match  with  a  Double Speed Kick. If they
       aren't  hit  by  the  first of the two, the second will catch
       them on its way down.


Human/Human sTrAgEdIeS:

   -   The  Thorn  doesn't  really have any particular attacks which
       lend  itself  to  surprise  or  strategy other than its Spike
       Charge.  Remembering  that  the  Spike  Charge can go through
       almost  all  basic  attacks,  as  well as many Special moves,
       such  as  projectiles,  try  and time it so that you'll catch
       your  opponent  attempting  to  Sweep you right at the moment
       you  execute  it.  However,  use  it  sparingly,  as if it is
       initially  blocked,  you're  completely  open  to  some major
       damage from your opponent.

   -   Although  limited  in use, the Thorn's Off-The-Wall Attack is
       effective in backing off your opponents when you're cornered.
       If you have both Enhancements, try jumping towards your enemy
       and  quickly doing the move in the middle of the screen where 
       they  won't  be expecting it. Again, use it sparingly to keep
       it effective.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

(3.4) Pyros
-----------

Description:

     The  Pyros  is  another example of a 'bot that relies primarily
on  raw power to win. Although many of its moves work fine against a
human  player,  as  there is minimal reaction time, you have to rely
more  on  chipping away at your opponent in One Player or Tournament
Mode  as  the computer blocks most of the moves every time. Although
its  flames  aren't  nearly  as  powerful  as  its  arms,  they  are
invulnerable  to  attack.  Any  special move that comes into contact
with  the flames (with the exception of the Thorn's Spike Charge) is
almost  always  stopped  cold.  That,  and AI flaws with the Pyros's
Crouching  Heavy  Punch  &  Fire  Spin, make it an entertaining, yet
challenging, 'bot to use.


Special Moves:

     Super Thrust             =    F,F+P
     Shadow Super Thrust      =    F,F,F+P
     Jet Swoop                =    (jump),D+K
     Fire Spin                =    D,P  <-- Down,release,THEN Punch

     Scrap Move       Part #1 =    F,F,D,D+P
                      Part #2 =    U+P(hold)
                                   Timing: Press  &  hold  U+P  very
                                   quickly  right  at the fourth hit
                                   of  the  Scrap. Hold it until you
                                   hear  the  Pyros  speed  up. It's
                                   hard  to get it right every time,
                                   but  it  can  be done easily with
                                   practice.
     Destruction Move         =    D+P(hold)
                                   Timing: Press  & hold D+P quickly
                                   right   at   the  eighth  hit  of
                                   the  Scrap. Once again, it's hard
                                   to  get  it  every time, but with
                                   practice,  you'll  be able to get
                                   it most of the time. 

     How to Get to Fire & Ice =    U,D,D+P
                                   Timing: This   is   by   far  the
                                   hardest  of  all the "Fire & Ice"
                                   moves  to  do  consistently.  You
                                   have  to  time  the move so as to
                                   press   the  D+P  right  as  your
                                   opponent explodes. You'll be able
                                   to  get  it most of the time with
                                   practice.  However, if you REALLY
                                   just can't get it to work, try it
                                   with  the  speed  turned  down  a
                                   couple  of notches and you should
                                   have less trouble.


Hyper Mode Enhancements:

Mid-Air Super Thrust         -     Lets  you do a Super Thrust while
                                   jumping.
                                   Combination: (jump),F,F+P

Mid-Air Fire Spin            -     A  Fire Spin that you can perform
                                   in mid-air.
                                   Combination: (jump),D,P


Tournament Enhancements:

First Enhancement:
Super-Fast Super Thrust      -     An incredibly fast version of the
                                   Pyros's Super Thrust.
         &                         Combination: Same as normal ST

Mid-Air Super Thrust         -     Lets  the Pyros do a Super Thrust
                                   in mid-air without Hyper Mode on.
                                   Combination: (jump),F,F+P
 
Second Enhancement:
The only place that I could find the Pyros' Second Enhancement was
from Bethany in the World Championship. And It really wasn't worth
the trouble, it would seem.

Turbo Mid-Air Super Thrust   -     The Pyros' MAST is much faster.
                                   Combination: Same as normal MAST


Effective Combos:

- My Best Combo, 6-hit Ground Based Bash -
Mode: Tournament     Req'd: Fast Pilot
Combination: (jump)+P,DB+P,B+P,B+P,DB+P,F,F+P
Description: Attack with a Jump Punch. Follow with a Crouching Heavy
Punch,  two  Standing  Heavy Punches, another Crouching Heavy Punch,
and  finish  with  a  Super Thrust. Since it's Ground Based, you can
finish  the  combo  no  matter  if your opponent becomes dizzy while
you're doing it or not as they won't fall till the last hit.
Difficulty(1-10): 5

- 3-hit Easy -
Mode: One,Two,Modem,Tournament     Req'd: Rehit
Combination: (get right beside opponent),D,P
Description: Get  as close as you can to your opponent and do a Fire
Spin.  If  Rehit  mode is on, you'll hit them three times with this.
Using  a character like Shirro in One/Two/Modem Player modes, you'll
be  able  to  almost  completely destroy your opponent with this one
combo.
Difficulty(1-10): 1

- Ground Based Fast Flame 5-hit -
Mode: Tournament     Req'd: Fast Pilot
Combination: (jump)+P,(land),D+K,D+K,D+K,DB+K

do  a  Standing  Medium  Flame,  followed by a Standing Heavy Flame.
Finish with a Super Thrust.
Difficulty(1-10): 6


Computer Cheats:

   -   There  isn't any real "set" way to cheat against the computer
       that  I've  been able to find with the Pyros, but there are a
       couple  of  things that it will occasionally fall for. One is
       to do a Standing Heavy Flame as the AI 'bot walks toward you.
       They'll  quite  often  do this up to three or four times in a
       row. This works best at the start of a match.

   -   A combo that I do against the computer to win when I'm losing
       that  works almost all of the time is to do a Jet Swoop, then
       as  soon  as  I  land  do a Crouching Medium Punch, Crouching
       Heavy  Punch,  Standing  Heavy  Punch,  and  a  Super Thrust.
       Against the shorter Flail & Gargoyle, omit the Standing Heavy
       Punch.
   
   -   And  doing  a  Jet  Swoop  and  following it with a Fire Spin
       will  also  connect  with some frequency, without leaving you
       particularly vulnerable to attack even if it doesn't.

   -   Lastly,  doing  a  Fire  Spin  when  the  computer is walking
       towards  you  will  sometimes cause it to walk right into the
       Spin.


Human/Human sTrAgEdIeZ:

   -   The  best  moves  for use against organically based opponents
       would  be  the  Super  Thrust and the Jet Swoop. Since people
       generally  don't  have  the  instantaneous  reflexes  of  the
       computer's  AI, you can expect the Super Thrust to be blocked
       less  often  if  you use it sparingly and sporadically. Also,
       jumping  away from your opponent and then quickly doing a Jet
       Swoop will catch the less-than-dextrously-gifted quite a bit,
       just so long as you don't develop a pattern.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

(3.5) Electra
-------------

Description:

     The  Electra,  while great for use in Two Player Mode, requires
taking  advantage of a couple of those wonderful AI bugs that let us
win  when nothing else will in One Player & Tournament Mode. Relying
primarily  on  lightning  (yes, a pun WAS intended) fast moves and a
great  defensive  Special  Move(Electric Shards),  the  Electra is a
'bot  for none but the most nimble of thumbs. Those of you destitute
of  the  requisite  motor skills may wish to choose a slower 'bot or
go play Links 386.


Special Moves:

     Lightning Ball           =    D-DB-B+P
     Electric Shards          =    D-DF-F+P
                                   Note: At any time during the ES,
                                   you can do a Rolling Thunder
     Rolling Thunder          =    F,F+P
     Shadow Rolling Thunder   =    D-DF-F,F+P
     
     Scrap Move               =    D,F+P
     Destruction Move         =    U-UF-F-DF-D+P
                                   Timing: Do   it   anytime   while
                                   the   Electra  is  "volting" your
                                   opponent.

     How to get to Fire & Ice =    F-DF-D+P
                                   Timing: Do  it  right  after your
                                   opponent  blows  up,  QUICKLY. If
                                   you  have  problems, do it over &
                                   over   while   the  lightning  is
                                   striking.


Hyper Mode Enhancements:

Directable Lightning Ball    -     Lets you control the direction of
                                   the   Lightning  Ball  after  you
                                   release  it  by  pressing  in any
                                   direction.
                                   Combination: Same as normal LB

Mid-Air Rolling Thunder      -     Do the Rolling Thunder in Mid-Air
                                   Combination: (jump),F,F+P


Tournament Enhancements:

First Enhancement:
Double Lightning Ball        -     Lets  you  release  two Lightning
                                   Balls at once.
          &                        Combination: Same as normal LB

Long-Range Electric Shards   -     Electric   Shards   have  a  much
                                   longer reach.
                                   Combination: Same as normal ES

Second Enhancement:
Triple Lightning Ball        -     Lets  you release three Lightning
                                   Balls at once.
                                   Combination: Same as normal LB


Effective Combos:

- My Best Combo, Jolt'n'Volt 13-hit -
Modes: Tournament     Req'd: Rehit,Fast Pilot,Both Enh,Dizzy
Combination: (jump)+K,(land)B+P,B+P,B+P,B+P,F+K,F+K,B+P,K,B+K,
             D-DB-B+P
Description: Attack  with a Jump Kick & follow with 4 Standing Heavy
Punches.  Continue  with  2  Standing  Light Kicks, a Standing Heavy
Punch,  a Standing Medium Kick, & a Standing Heavy Kick. Finish with
a Triple Lightning Ball. Note that you have to time it just right to
get all three Lightning Balls to hit your opponent.
Difficulty(1-10): 8

- Quick-Kicks 21-hit Ground Based -
Modes: Tournament     Req'd: Fast Pilot,Corner
Combination: (jump)+K,DF+K(15-19 times),DB+K
Description: Attack  with  a  Jump  Kick and follow it with up to 19
Crouching  Light  Kicks, and finish with a Sweep. It's only possible
to  get a 21-hit combo against a slow pilot, as far as I know. I can
get a 21-hit combo against Ibraham in a Shadow most every time.
Difficulty(1-10): 2

- Beat'n'Retreat 8-hit -
Mode: Tournament     Req'd: Rehit,Fast Pilot,Corner
Combination: (jump)+K,(land),K,K,B+K,B+K,D-DF-F,F+P
Description: Attack  with  a  Jump  Kick  and follow with 2 Standing
Medium  Kicks.  Continue with 2 Standing Heavy Kicks and finish with
a Shadow Rolling Thunder.
Difficulty(1-10): 7


Computer Cheats:

   -   The easiest cheat to use against the computer is to do a Jump
       Attack  and  then do as many Crouching Light Kicks as you can
       as  soon  as  you  land. The computer never blocks these, and
       will quickly become dizzy, allowing you to either repeat this
       or do another combo of your choosing.


Human/Human sTrAgEdIeZ:

   -   Use  the  Electric  Shards  to  thwart most Basic and Special
       Attacks  from  your  opponents.  Be sure to utilize the long-
       range potential of the Electra by making distance between you
       and your opponent and doing the Shadow Rolling Thunder. Also,
       a good strategy is to launch a Lightning Ball and then direct
       it  upward,  since  most  people  tend  to  try and jump them 
       instinctively.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

(3.6) Katana
------------

Description:

     Definitely  one  of  the most enjoyable 'bots to play with, the
Katana  has  a  well  rounded  variety  of basic Attacks and Special
Moves,  the  latter  of  which,  when used properly, can madden your
human  opponents  to  the point of less than tasteful dialogue. With
some  very  strong attacks and a good assortment of possible combos,
the  Katana  is about the most well rounded 'bot to use. Once again,
for those of you who might occasionally get stuck against a computer
opponent,  I've  found  a  couple  of useful AI loopholes to get you
through those tight Tournament matches.


Special Moves:

     Rising Blade             =    D-DF-F+P (Invincible)
     Shadow Rising Blade      =    B-DB-D-DF-F+P (Invincible)

           to  move,  respectively,  either  Left  or Right. It also
           should  be noted that you can perform an air attack while

           in  the  air, once it starts spinning, by pressing in any 
           direction.  Also,  if  you bounce off your opponent doing
           the  Spin,  and  then  go against a wall before you land,
           you'll go into another Spin.

                                   your opponent's 'bot. If you just
                                   can't  get it to work, keep doing

                                   you do the Destruction move.

I've  heard  that the Katana has a third Enhancement which gives him
the  Fireball  that "Fire", the secret character in One Player Mode,
uses.  But  as  of  yet I haven't been able to find it. I'm assuming
that  you  have  to  get  it  with  your  second  enhancement from a
particular  Unranked  Challenger(like the Shadow's Freeze Blast that
you get from Iceman in the North American), but it wasn't the Iceman
Katana  in  the  World  Championship.  Anyone  got any tips short of
hex-editing my saved character?

Computer Cheats:

   -   The  computer  doesn't  seem  to  understand  the  concept of
       blocking  the Katana's Head Stomp. You can pretty much win an
       entire match by just continually doing the Head Stomp on your
       opponents  until they become dizzy. The computer at most only
       blocks it 2 out of every 3 times.

   -   If  your  reflexes are up to the challenge, you can also just
       wait  for the computer to do any kind of attack and retaliate
       with  a  Rising  Blade.  Remember  that  you  are  completely
       invulnerable  doing  the  Rising  Blade  until it reaches its
       apex, so any move of any other 'bots coming into contact with
       a Katana in the middle of Rising Blade OR Shadow Rising Blade
       will take damage while the Katana goes unscathed.


Human/Human sTrAgEdIeZ:

   -   Knowing  of  the  invincibility of the Katana's Rising Blade,
       expect  experienced  opponents to try to "bluff" an attack to
       get  you to do a Rising Blade, opening yourself up to attack.
       Only use the Rising Blade either to thwart an attack to which
       your   enemy   has  already  commited,  or  to  pass  through
       projectiles  when  your  enemy is at a distance. Use the Head
       Stomp sparingly, as your fleshly opponents, unlike the game's
       AI,  know better than to take a continual beating from you in
       such  manner.  Also,  do  a Forward Razor Spin and then press
       Kick  while  you're  flying towards your opponent for a turbo
       charged  Jump Kick that works great for surprising enemies at
       a distance.

(3.7) Shredder
--------------

Description:

     The  Shredder,  while  it  is  probably one of the best rounded
'bots  in  the  game,  doesn't really excell in any particular area.
It  has  a couple of great Special Moves, some powerful Basic Moves,
and  looks  cool  to boot. But, the computer doesn't seem to respect
its  cool  looks,  as  it  plays  against the 'bot quite well on the
higher  difficulty  levels. However, I've been able to find a couple
of  cracks  in  the  games's AI to let you win despite the fact that
you're  strategically  challenged.  Most  important to remember when
using the Shredder is that this 'bot's only advantage over the other
'bots  is its virtually unlimited assortment of powerful combos. All
of  its  Special  Moves  complement  each  other  by being able work
together  in  one  combo. For an example of using this to your great
advantage,  check out the 18-hit combo below. Or you can watch it by
playing  the  "SHREDDER.REC" file that should have come with the ZIP
file you obtained this FAQ from.


Special Moves:

     Flying Hands             =    D-DB-B+P
     Head-Butt                =    D-DF-F+P
     Shadow Head-Butt         =    B-DB-D-DF-F+P
     Flip Kick                =    D,D+K
                                   NOTE: You   can  do  any  mid-air
                                   Attack  at  any  time  during the
                                   Flip Kick.

     Scrap Move               =    D,F+P
     Destruction Move         =    D,U,U+P
                                   Timing: Do  it  at any time while
                                   the  Shredder  is  shredding your
                                   opponent.

     How to get to Fire & Ice =    U-UB-B-DB-D+K
                                   Timing: The easiest way to do the
                                   move  is  to  press  and  hold up
                                   while  your  Shredder tosses your
                                   opponent into the air, and the do
                                   the  rest of the move right after
                                   your  opponent  explodes.  If you
                                   can't seem to get it to work, try
                                   doing  the  move  over  and  over
                                   while & after your opponent is in
                                   the air.

                                   Combination: Same as normal FH

Effective Combos:

- My Best Combo, 18-Hit Sure Death -
Modes: Tournament     Req'd: Rehit, Dizzy, Corner, Fast Pilot
Combination: (jump),D+K,(land),D+K,K,B+K,B+K,B+K-DB-D-DF-F+P,
             B+P-DB-D-DF-F+P,P,D,D+K,D-DF-F+P,(land),D-DB-B+P,
             D-DF-F+P,K,B+K
Description: Get  your  opponent  dizzy  and  in  a corner, and then
attack  with  a  Jump  Kick. Go straight out of the Jump Kick into a
Flip  Kick,  and  after  the  Flip Kick connects for the second hit,
quickly  press  Kick  before you land. As soon as you land, do three
Standing  Heavy  Kicks,  and  follow with a Shadow Head Butt, then a
Standing  Heavy  Punch,  another  Shadow  Head  Butt, and a Standing
Medium  Punch.  Go  into  another Flip Kick, and after it hits once,
do  a  Mid-Air  Head-Butt. As soon as you land, do the Flying Hands.
Immediately  after the flying hands, do a Head Butt, then a Standing
Medium Kick, and finish with a Standing Heavy Kick. This is the most
destructive combo I've found for any 'bot in the game, and will take
off  between  3/4  and  7/8  of any characters energy. However, it's
extremely  difficult  to pull off, and takes alot of practice to get
down  with any efficiency, but makes for an excellent tape to replay
for  your  friends. Note that you can't FINISH the combo unless your
opponent  is  already dizzy, although you can go so far into it, get
them  dizzy,  and  THEN  do  the full version... if they have enough
energy  left.  Note that this combo doesn't work as well against the
smaller  'bots,  such as the Gargoyle and Flail, as some of the hits
will  miss  them  due  to  their short height. I've found this combo
easiest to perform against the Nova, for some reason.
Difficulty(1-10): 10

- Multi-Head Butt 6-Hit -
Modes: Tournament     Req'd: Rehit, Fast Pilot
Combination: (qtr screen away),B-DB-D-DF-F+P,B+P-DB-D-DF-F+P,DB+P,
             D-DF-F+P,B+K
Description: From  at  least a quarter of a screen away, do a Shadow
Head  Butt,  follow  with a quick Standing Heavy Punch, then another
Shadow Head Butt,  and  a  Crouching Heavy Punch. Finish with a Head
Butt  followed  by  a quick Standing Heavy Kick to put them into the
wall.  This  will  make  any  opponent dizzy, setting you up for the
18-hit combo listed above.
Difficulty(1-10): 6


Computer Cheats:

   -   There  are  three ways to cheat against the computer with the
       Shredder  that  I've found. The first is to do a Flying Hands
       attack  whenever  the  computer  is  walking towards you. The
       computer  for  some  reason  almost  always jumps into it. It
       works  best  when you have the First Enhancement. Also, start
       off  every  match against the computer with the Flying Hands.
       This hits nearly every time.

   -   The second cheat is to attack the computer with a Jump Attack
       and then do lots of quick Standing Light Punches. These never
       fail to hit the computer; just be careful of a Counter-Attack
       by  the  computer  when your attacking with just a plain Jump
       Kick or Punch.

   -   And  lastly,  my favorite way to cheese AI opponents is to do
       a  Flip Kick, wait for it to hit the computer once(whether it
       connects  or  not),  and  immediately do a Mid-Air Head Butt.
       Not  only  does  the computer almost never block this, but it
       also allows you to go into the above mentioned 6-hit combo.


Human/Human sTrAgEdIeZ:

   -   Playing  with  the Shredder against your carbon-based enemies
       can  be  very  effective  if you know when to use its Special
       Moves.  It's  best  to use the Head-Butt for surprise attacks
       from  long  range  when there's distance between you and your
       opponent,  and  the  Flying  Hands when they're too close for
       comfort.  The  Flip  Kick is effective against almost all Air
       Attacks, Special or Basic, and is great for going into combos
       with. Remember that the only real advantage that the Shredder
       has is its nigh unlimited assortment of combos, so be sure to
       master these before expecting many victories with it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

(3.8) Flail
-----------

Description:

     Definitely  the  oddball of the group, I can imagine the Elam's
conceptualizing  the designs for the Flail after one too many slices
of  a  Meat-Lover's pizza with extra pepperoni. This 'bot looks like
it  could  handle anything from smart missiles to heavy indigestion.
And  it  can,  too.  (I'm guessing on the indigestion part) Although
discouraging  to  learn,  the  Flail is one of the more interesting,
and  fun,  'bots  to  use. And Although he's hard to use against the
instantaneous  reflexes of the computer, he's a blast to use against
your  friends-turned-enemies  in  Two  Player Mode. However, to even
things  out  in  your  battle against unfair AI response time, there
are  a  couple  of  bugs  that  you can use to win your personal war
against the evil Major.


Special Moves

     Charge Punch             =    B,B+P
     Shadow Charge Punch      =    D-DB-B,B+P
     Slow Chain Spin          =    D,K

     Spinning Throw Grab      =    F,F+K  <-- Must be near opponent;
                                              can be done in air.

     Scrap            Part #1 =    F,F,F+P
                      Part #2 =    F,B+P
                                   Timing: Time  it  so that you hit
                                   Back  &  Punch  right  after  the
                                   Flail slams your opponent against
                                   the  wall.  If  you have problems
                                   getting  it  to  work,  just keep
                                   doing  the  sequence F,B+P over &
                                   over during the first slam.

     Destruction              =    B,F+P
                                   Timing: Do  this after your Flail
                                   turns  around  and  starts toward
                                   the  other  wall.  If  you  can't
                                   seem  to  get  it  to work right,
                                   keep  doing  the  sequence  B,F+P
                                   over  and over right after you do
                                   the Scrap Part #2.

     How to get to Fire & Ice =    F-DF-D-DB-B+K,(rep)
                                   Timing: I'm  not  real sure about
                                   this one. I just do the move over
                                   and  over after my opponent blows
                                   up. 


Hyper Mode Enhancements:

Mobile Chain Spins           -     Lets  your Flail move while doing
                                   a  Heavy  or  Light Chain Spin by
                                   pressing  Left  or  Right on your
                                   controller.

Tournament Enhancements:

First Enhancements:
This one gives the Flail all kinds of goodies...

Mobile Chain Spins           -     Lets  you  do a MCS without Hyper
                                   mode on.

* Slow Chain Spin/           -     Lets  you  do a Charging Punch at
  Charging Punch Combo             any  time  during  a SCS. Just do
                                   the  Charging  Punch  at any time
                                   during the Flail's SCS.

* Charging Punch Safety      -     Lets you do a Spinning Throw Grab
  Throw                            while  coming  out  of a Charging
                                   Punch  or  Shadow Charging Punch.
                                   Do  the Spinning Throw Grab RIGHT
                                   AFTER   you  hit  your  opponent,
                                   whether  it connects or not. This
                                   makes  the  Flail less vulnerable
                                   when using the CP.

* Second Enhancement:
The only place that I could find the Flail's second Enhancement
was from Devan Shell in the Katushai Challenge.

Turbo Shadow Charging Punch  -     The  SCP  is  extremely  fast and
                                   does more damage.
                                   Combination: Same as normal SCP

Fast Chain Spin/             -     Lets  you  do a Charging Punch at
Charging Punch Combo               any  time  during  a  Fast  Chain
                                   Spin.  Just do the CP at any time
                                   during the FCS.

Modes: One,Two,Modem,Tournament     Req'd: Rehit,Corner
Combination: (grab),F,F+K
Description: Do  a  Grab on your opponent while they're in a corner.
As  soon  as  your Flail releases them, do a Spinning Throw Grab. If
you time it right, you'll catch them every time.
Difficulty(1-10): 2

Combination: (jump)+P,F+P,F+P,F+K
Description: Attack with a Jump Punch & follow with two Standing
Light Punches. Finish with a Spinning Throw Grab.
Difficulty(1-10): 5


Computer Cheats:

   -   To win against the computer, the only move you ever need use
       is the Flail's Slow Chain Spin. Do it with Hyper mode on in
       any mode at any skill level, and move towards your opponent
       while spinning. The computer usually only blocks the first
       hit, while letting the others connect freely. Sometimes the
       AI will start to wise up, and begin blocking it more often on
       the higher difficulty levels. If it does, just mix it up with
       an occasional Charging Punch from a distance, and then start
       all over with the Slow Chain Spin again.


Human/Human sTrAgEdIeZ:

   -   Though aggravating to learn, the Flail's chains can be used
       to drive your opponents up the wall. Against some opponent,
       you can nearly win a match by just doing Crouching Medium
       Flails the whole time, since opponents without projectiles
       can do little to stop them. Also, you can often catch those
       annoying opponents who like to just constantly with a
       Spinning Throw Grab done in mid-air. Just time their jump,
       and then jump up and towards them, immediately doing the
       STG. It takes practice and some pretty quick finger magic,
       but you'll get the hang of it.

(3.9) Gargoyle
--------------

Description:

     The  Gargoyle  is really one of my favorite all around 'bots to
use.  This  may  be because of his unique appearance, differing from
anything  in all other fighting game out there. Or it may be because
all  of  its  moves are easy to learn and no problem to get off in a
pinch.  But  whatever the reason, the Gargoyle is one of the easiest
'bots  to  win  against the computer with, and one of the hardest to
beat when controlled by a quick-fingered friend. Combining a mixture
of speed and a great defensive Special Move(Flying Talon), this 'bot
is  one  of the most fun to use in either One Player, Two Player, or
Tournament  Mode. Be sure to note that you can control the direction
of  the Gargoyle's jump by pressing Up & Back or Up & Forward to go,
respectively,  either  Back or Forward while jumping. This is really
handy  when  a  change  of  direction  in  mid-air is preferrable to
landing  in  your  opponents  arms.


Special Moves:

     Wing Charge              =    F,F+P
     Diving Claw Grab         =    (jump),D+K <- When   nearly  over
                                                 your opponent
                                   NOTE: You can control the left/
                                   right direction of the Grab by
                                   pressing left or right while the
                                   the Gargoyle is diving.
     Flying Talon             =    D-DF-F+P
                                   NOTE: You can perform another
                                   attack, such as a Jump Punch or
                                   Diving Claw, after the Flying
                                   Talon has reached its apex.
                                   

     Scrap Move               =    B-DB-D-DF-F+P
     Destruction Move         =    D,U,D+P
                                   Timing: Time  it  so that you hit
                                   D+P   right  after  the  Gargoyle
                                   lands  on  your  opponent. If you
                                   have  problems, simply keep doing
                                   the  sequence U,D+P over and over
                                   after  the  Gargoyle flys off the
                                   top of the screen.

     How to get to Fire & Ice =    D,D,D+P
                                   Timing: Do   the  sequence  right
                                   after  the Gargoyle destroys your
                                   opponent and flies off the top of
                                   the  screen. If you have problems
                                   getting  it  to  work right, just
                                   keep  pressing  D+P  over  & over
                                   after  the  Gargoyle flys off the
                                   top   of  the  screen  after  the
                                   Destruction.


Hyper Mode Enhancements:

Mid-Air Wing Charge          -     Lets  you  do  a  Wing  Charge in
                                   mid-air.
                                   Combination: (jump),F,F+P
                                   NOTE: You can do a Diving Claw
                                   Grab at anytime during a MAWC.
                                   This proves very effective for
                                   surprise tactics.

Mid-Flying Talon Wing        -     Lets you do a Wing Charge at any
Charge                             time during a FT.
                                   Combination: F,F+P (at any time
                                                during the FT)


Tournament Enhancements:

First Enhancement:
Best  I  can  tell, this Enhancement just lets you do a mid-air Wing
Charge,  even  when Hyper Mode isn't turned on in the Gameplay menu.
That's  a  real  bonus.  Like most people really play this game with
Hyper Mode off?

* Second Enhancement:
The  only  place that I could find the Gargoyle's Second Enhancement
was from Bethany in the World Championship.

Turbo Mid-Air Wing Charge    -     The  MAWC  is  much  faster  than
                                   before.
                                   Combination: Same as normal MAWC


Effective Combos:

- My Best Combo, 11-hit Killer -
Modes: Tournament     Req'd: Rehit,Corner,Dizzy,Fast Pilot
Combination: (jump)+K,(land),B+P,B+P,D-DF-F+P,F+P,(land),F+P,B+P,
             B+K,DB+P,D-DF-F+P,F+P,D+K
Description: Get  your opponent Dizzy and in a corner. Attack with a
Jump  Kick and follow with 2 Standing Heavy Punches. Continue with a
Flying  Talon  and  then  do  a  Mid-Air  Wing Charge as soon as the
Flying Talon hits. As soon as you land, do a regular Wing Charge and
follow  it  with  a Standing Heavy Punch, a Standing Heavy Kick, & a
Crouching  Heavy Punch. Then do another Flying Talon, and as soon as
it  hits,  do  another  Mid-Air  Wing Charge. This will not hit your
opponent  as  you've  already  hit them with one of these since they
were  knocked  into the air--but quickly press D+K as soon as you've
done  the MAWC, and you'll catch them with a Diving Claw Grab, which
you HAVEN'T used yet. You have to do that last part VERY fast to get
it  to  work,  so  it might take a few tries. Just to make sure that
it's possible, check out the "GARGOYLE.REC" file.
Difficulty(1-10): 10

- 8-hit Dizzier -
Modes: Tournament     Req'd: Rehit,Corner,Fast Pilot
Combination: (close to opponent),F,F+P,F+P,B+P,D-DF-F+P,F+P,(land),
             B+K,P,(jump),D+K
Description: Get close to your opponent, at least at Sweep range. Do
2  consecutive Wing Charges, and follow with a Standing Heavy Punch.
Continue  with a Flying Talon, and as soon as the Flying Talon hits,
do  a  Mid-Air Wing Charge. As soon as you land, do a Standing Heavy
Kick and then a Standing Medium Punch. Finish by jumping straight up
& doing a Diving Claw Grab.
Difficulty(1-10): 8

Computer Cheats:

   -   All you have to do to win on any skill level in any mode when
       using the Gargoyle is to continually do the Diving Claw Grab.
       The computer won't block it 95% of the time.

   -   Also,  if  you're  cornered,  just do lots of Crouching Heavy
       Punches.  The computer almost never blocks them and will walk
       into them over and over.


Human/Human sTrAgEdIeZ:

   -   The  Diving  Claw Grab and Wing Charge both prove very useful
       in  Two Player games, especially when used together. The best
       way  to catch your opponent off-guard is to do a Flying Talon
       and  then  quickly  do  a Mid-Air Wing Charge to zoom over to
       your  opponent  and  do a Diving Claw Grab. When playing with
       the  speed  set  up, this is nigh unto impossible to react in
       time  to avoid. But avoid doing it too often, or developing a
       predictable  pattern,  as that would render the strategy near
       useless.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

(3.A) Chronos
-------------

Description:

     Being  much  better  suited  for  Two  Player games than the vs
Computer  Modes,  the  Chronos  is  a kick to beat your buddies with
after  you've  mastered  the timing required to use him effectively.
Not  really  excelling  in  any  particular strengths nor garnishing
any  real  flaws  in regards to Speed, Power, and Armor, the Chronos
is  pretty  well-rounded, but by no means special either. In regards
to  One  Player & Tournament modes, expect to have more trouble with
the  computer  than  you  do against your friends using the Chronos.
Almost  all  of  its  moves require that your opponent doesn't react
immediately; and as you know, this is basically the only defense the
computer  knows.  And  on  the higher difficulty levels the computer
almost  always  blocks  your  attacks  or  thwarts  your Teleport by
grabbing  you  before  you  even  finish  materializing  beside him.
However,  I  HAVE  found a couple of ways that you can cheat against
the computer, despite its unfair lack of a reflex allowment, letting
you still find all the Unranked Challengers and get both the
Chronos' worthless Enhancements.


Special Moves:

     Stasis Activator         =    D-DB-B+P
     Slow Stasis Activator    =    F-DF-D-DB-B+P
     Matter Phasing           =    D-DB-B+K <- Can be done in air
     Teleport                 =    D,P <- Down,release,THEN Punch
                                   NOTE: You  can  control the move-
                                   ment  of the Teleport by pressing
                                   left  or  right while the Chronos
                                   is  "phasing"  out. Pressing left
                                   will  port you to the far left of
                                   the  screen, while pressing right
                                   will  port  you to the far right.
                                   If you press in no direction, you
                                   end   up   directly  behind  your
                                   opponent.

     Scrap Move               =    D,F+P
*    Destruction Move         =    F,B,P
                                   Timing: Time   it   so  that  you
                                   press   the  P  right  after  the
                                   Chronos's  arm  goes  inside your
                                   opponent.  It's  real  hard to do
                                   it  exact  with the speed all the
                                   way  up,  so if you have problems
                                   just  keep  pressing F,B,P over &
                                   over during the Scrap.

     How to get to Fire & Ice =    D-DB-B+P
                                   Timing: Do  the  move right after
                                   your  opponent  blows up. This is
                                   probably  the  easiest of all the
                                   "Fire & Ice"  moves  to  perform,
                                   but unfortunately, with a 'bot as
                                   crappy  as  the Chronos, you most
                                   likely  won't  get to use it that
                                   much.


Hyper Mode Enhancements:
Controllable Stasis          -     Lets  you  control  the Direction
Activators                         of   the  Stasis  &  Slow  Stasis
                                   after  it's  released by pressing
                                   in  any  direction  with  the SSA
                                   after  it  stops moving, but just
                                   up  & down with the SA right when
                                   you release it.
                                   Combination: Same as normal SA &
                                                SSA

First Enhancement:
I got this Enhancement from Bethany in the War Invitational.

Controllable Stasis          -     Lets  you  control  the Direction
Activators                         of  these  without Hyper Mode on.
                                   Wheee.
                                   Combination: Same as normal SA &

Second Enhancement:

I  got  a Second Enhancement from Bethany in the World Championship,
but I'll be $#%&*@ if I know what it does.

As  soon  as  you release them, quickly do a Stasis Activator. If it
freezes  them,  do  a  Matter  Phasing and follow it with a Standing
Heavy  Punch.  Note  that  you  cannot  catch  the Thorn, Jaguar, or
Electra  with the Stasis Activator after the Grab since they fall so
quickly.

Difficulty(1-10): 1


Computer Cheats:

   -   There  are  two  ways  I've  found  that can be used to cheat
       against  the  computer.  The  first  is  to  use the Chronos'
       Standing  Light  Kick  continually. Following any Jump Attack
       with  this  almost always connects, allowing you to follow it
       with  stronger  attacks  such  as  a  Standing Heavy Punch or
       Kick.  You  can also start out every match with this move and
       connect almost every time if you do two or three in a row.

   -   The  second cheat is to get in about the middle of the screen
       and  release a Stasis Activator. The computer always tries to
       jump  it. When it does, it always attacks early, allowing you
       to  do a Standing Heavy Punch when they reach you. You can do
       this over and over during a match.


Human/Human sTrAgEdIeZ:

   -   Facing  human opponents is where you can really have the most
       fun with the Chronos. You can actually get results when using
       the Teleport and Matter Phasing moves against those with less
       than  instantaneous reflexes. One of my favorite ways to make
       my  opponent  nervous  is to do the Teleport from one side of
       the   screen,  but  stay  on  the  side  of  the  screen  I'm
       Teleporting  from,  thus staying in the same place. Launch as
       many Stasis Activators as you can, directing them upward most
       of  the  time so you'll occasionally catch them with one when
       they  try  to jump it. Also, launch a Slow Stasis Activator &
       follow  it  towards  your opponent. If they try to attack you
       while  you're  behind the SSA, they'll get frozen and you can
       do the combo of your choice.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

(3.B) Nova
----------

Description:

     If  you can't win with the Nova, then you might want to go back
to  Karate Champ in your local arcade. But if you prove effective at
utilizing  raw power, hate racking your brain in an effort to devise
brilliant  combos, or just like to feel BAD, the Nova will obviously
be  the  'bot  of choice for you. If the Nova were a weapon in DOOM,
it  would  be a quadruple-barrel Shotgun--not the prettiest of toys,
but  definitely  carrying  that  feeling of unstoppable destruction.
The  Nova,  when  fully  rigged,  is  fast,  powerful,  &  tough. It
surpasses  all the other 'bots in terms of basic Attack superiority,
Special  Move  damage,  and an almost unlimited number of incredibly
powerful  combos.  Even if you're the finesse player who prefers the
grace  and  eloquence  of motion of the Katana to the brute force of
the  Thorn,  you'll  love using the Nova if for no other reason than
to  see  it  smash  the  top  half  of  your opponent off with sheer
strength  during  its  Destruction.  All  you DOOMers out there have
fun! See Section (2.9) for instructions on how to select the Nova in
a One Player game if you have version 2.0.


Special Moves:

     Missile                  =    D-DF-F+P

     Mini-Grenade             =    D-DB-B+P
     Earthquake Slam          =    D,D+P
     Chest Slam               =    (jump),D+P When over opponent

     Scrap Move               =    D-DB-B,F+P
     Destruction Move         =    D,D,D,P
                                   Timing: Time  it  so that you hit
                                   P  right  after  the fifth hit of
                                   the  Scrap. If you have problems,
                                   keep  hitting  D,P  over  &  over
                                   after the third hit of the Scrap.

     How to get to Fire & Ice =    Undiscovered at this time


Hyper Mode Enhancements:

None Known(or needed)


Tournament Mode Enhancements:

     I've   used  the  Nova  against  every  character  in  all  the 
Tournaments,  as well as  all  Unranked  Challengers,  but  I've yet
to  get  an  enhancement. To be honest, I don't know what they could
improve,  unless  it  was  to  make  its  projectiles(Missile,  Air-
Missile,  &  Mini-Grenade)  faster.  But  that would only be tipping
already uneven-in-our-favor scales more out of balance, now wouldn't
it?


Effective Combos:

- My Best Combo, 7-hit Bash-n-Slam -
Modes: Tournament     Req'd: Rehit,Corner,Fast Pilot
Combination: (jump),D+P,(land),P,P,DB+P,P,(jump),D+P
Description: Attack  with a Chest Slam. As soon as you hit and land,
IMMEDIATELY  do  2  Standing Medium Punches & then a Crouching Heavy
Punch. Follow with a Standing Medium Punch while they're in the air.
Finish  by  quickly  jumping towards your opponent and doing a Chest
Slam.
Difficulty(1-10): 8

- Easy All-Mode Ground Based 5-hit -
Modes: One,Two,Modem,Tournament     Req'd: Fast Pilot
Combination: (jump)+K,P,P,DB+P

Difficulty(1-10): 2

- High Damage 4-Hit -

Description: Attack  with a Jump Punch. Follow with a Standing Heavy
Punch  and a Standing Heavy Kick. Finish with another Standing Heavy
Punch.
Difficulty(1-10): 3


Computer Cheats:

   -   You  can  win  the  entire  game every time on any difficulty
       level  by  just  continually  doing  the  Nova's far-reaching
       Sweep.

   -   A less mind-numbing way to beat the computer is to knock your
       opponent  down  however you choose, and then quickly launch a
       Smart  Missile.  Do an Earthquake Slam, timing it so that you
       slam  the  ground  right  when the Smart Missile is over your
       opponent. You can do this over and over and over and...


Human/Human sTrAgEdIeZ:

   -   The  cheat  for the computer listed above regarding the Smart
       Missile  works just as well against humans as it does against
       the  computer. However, if they're using a 'bot with a Shadow
       variation of a move, such as the Shadow Jaguar Leap, they can
       pass  through  your  Smart Missile. Also, try launching Smart
       Missiles  continually.  If  they jump straight up, just do an
       Earthquake  Slam,  timing it so that you hit the ground right
       when they land. If they jump towards you, do a Standing Heavy
       Punch  to  knock  them out of the air. Be sure to use the Air
       Missile  to your advantage as well. It works effectively when
       jumping  towards  your  opponent  and  launching  one halfway
       through your jump. It will often catch them off guard.

     Here's  a  few odds'n'ends things that you're more than welcome
to  read  if  you  haven't  already  fried  your  brain trying to do
everything  described  in  this  FAQ. But, if you're the stoic, red-
meat  only  type  who read  this  solely for the facts, feel free to
skip  this  part.  You  don't want to see what I wrote about your...
well... just skip it.



(4.1) The Future of OMF
-----------------------
 
     One Must Fall: 2097  is  one  of the more excellent examples of
PC  gaming,  and  will  most  certainly continue to improve upon the
debut  of  the series with each new upgrade and release. Up & coming
products in the OMF line include:

     
     -     OMF: 2097 CD! Just prior to releasing version 2.2 of this
           FAQ,  I  received  this  message  regarding  the  OMF  CD
           version:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
From: craig@epicgames.com (Craig Lafferty)
Newsgroups: comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action
Subject: Re: OMF 2097 CD?
Date: 17 Jul 1995 19:27:40 GMT
Organization: Epic MegaGames


We will be releasing ONE MUST FALL 2097 on CD in a few weeks, once the
modem/network play is solid.  This will be as a delivery method and WILL NOT
BE an enhanced game.  OMf 2097 II (tenative name) will be out late this
year or early next year on CD and will be a new or greatly enhanced game.

           Well,  so  much  for  all the hype that was getting built
           up for THIS one. Maybe it's all just a scheme and they're
           REALLY going to surprise us.. or not. Oh well.


     -     OMF ][... Presently  going  under the name "OMF Enhanced"
           (according  to  the  September  '95 PC Gamer), this game,
           despite its misleading title, is going to be a completely
           new  OMF  sequel. It supposedly has new 'bots, as well as
           the  old,  new SCROLLING backgrounds(the lack of which in
           my  opinion  was  the  only  flaw with the original), and
           a few surprises. All of the 'bots are supposed to be true
           3D  rendered  objects  as well. According to the PC Gamer
           article, Epic is shooting for a Fall release, but I'd say
           we probably won't see it until at least Christmas.


     I'll  add  all information regarding these products to this FAQ
     as it becomes available.



(4.2) Future Expansion
----------------------
     
     For those of you annoyed at not having a complete list of every
single  combo  I've  ever  found, or more news on up & coming things  
from  the  Elams  & Epic, this FAQ is being continually updated with 
additions,  revisions, and corrected mistakes offered as they become
available. (In other words, when ever I feel like typing them in)

     Future revisions will include:

     -    Even more combos and other useless stuff...
     
     -    More news on the upcoming OMF CD and OMF ][

     -    Any  additional Secrets and Unranked Challengers not known
          at this time

     Like  I  said,  I  INTEND to add in all this stuff, but (insert
typical, non-commital excuse here), so don't sue me, eh?

mail  via  the  International PC Gaming echo on FidoNet. If you feel
like  you  have  to  send  a  personal  message, you can send it via

     If  you have previously routed questions concerning OMF through
David  Laprad's  e-mail  address, please note that this is no longer
used,  due  to the complicated process of transferring mail back and
forth  from his account to me, and vice-versa. Yes, that's right. I,
unfortunately,  do  not  have Internet access at this time, although
local  service  is  due  here  in a couple more months.(Please don't
write  asking where I live. I nearly break down and cry every time I
discuss it.)

     At  this  time,  the  information I primarily need is listed in
Section  (2.A).  However,  I  would additionally like to know of any
great  combos  you've discovered, as well as any good strategies for
Human/Human play.  I   will  give  credit to whoever contributes the
information  that I  use in this file. So if you'd get a kick out of
knowing  that  your  name's  on  every  gaming freak-this-side-of-a-
Macintosh's  computer, find  some  stuff that I don't know about OMF
and mail it to us. The help's really appreciated.
