<p><I>Let it be noted that part of this story overlaps with events you
probably saw on TV (or read in the manga)... but tells it from a
slightly different point-of-view. Some of the people in Nappa's past
have been previously mentioned: Diive in Chapter 12 of "Mythic
Descent" and Rashi and Diive both in Hyper-Angel's story "Closer to
the Heart".
</I></p>
<HR>
<p>"Acknowledged."

<p>
It was a short message, barely more than a few
words interspersed with noise on the hyperwave
channel--a terribly short message to signal the doom of a world.

<p>The Marshal of Vegetasai pulled his reluctant hand away from the
scouter's transmit button. With an odd detachment, Nappa noted that his
hand was shaking. How strange. He shook it, and tapped the scouter
again; where in all this chaos was the prince?

<p>The massive Saiyan tapped twice more on the scouter, opening a
channel to Vegeta. "Prince Vegeta, do you read me?" he asked,
his voice carefully impassive.

<p>
"What is it?" answered the prince, sounding bored.

<p>
"We've just received a message from Lord Frieza."

<p>The Marshal of Vegetasai was a Saiyan, and not just any Saiyan--he
was an elite warrior and a noble. Centuries of tradition dictated
that an elite showed no passions except anger at his enemies and
pleasure in their destruction. Even then, extremes were disdained;
extremes suggested lack of control, and lack of control was a
weakness. But within... Nappa felt nothing at first, not even anger;
just numbness, as if all the words were meaningless sounds that had
nothing to do with him.

<p>"Vegetasai has been destroyed by a rogue asteroid."  Nappa paused,
listening the young prince.

<p>They were all dead, all but the merest handful of Saiyans. The last
of his sons and daughters were dead because of a cosmic accident. The
king to whom Nappa had sworn his oaths on bended knee was
dead. Centuries of tradition and history had been blasted to crumbled
rock and dust.  Vegetasai was gone.

<p>In later years, Nappa questioned the truth of the accident: how
could a rogue asteroid that was large enough to destroy his world
remain undetected before it just happened to collide with
Vegetasai--less than a day after the King resolved to defy Frieza over
Prince Vegeta?  But that was many bitter years later; now, he only
knew that his entire people had died a shameful death, caught unawares
by a mindless force of nature like some peasant in the field. It was
no way for a warrior race to end!

<p>"And?" Prince Vegeta answered with a tone of "Why are you bothering me
with this?"
<p>
Nappa continued, "Including us, there are very few survivors."

<p>For the first time, he found consolation in Rashi's death, for his
wife had died in battle years ago, the way a warrior should. He hadn't
been numb, then--he'd felt her die, felt the blast that had torn her
nearly in half, felt her spirit slip away from him. He'd felt rage and
despair and emptiness, then--and hidden it away, keeping always
the stern, impassive face of the Marshal of Vegetasai.

<p>Col, his third son, had died in battle just a few short months
ago. He, too, had been fortunate. There was no such consolation in the
memory of his first son, Diive, so many years ago--better that he had
died with his brothers and sisters under the asteroid than to die a
traitor's death. To condemn one's own son to death for treason was a
bitter thing. Bitterer still had been his favorite son's curses when
Nappa killed the alien woman and child that had led Diive to his
dishonorable fate.

<p>Wretched vermin! He'd remembered them every time he
ordered a Saiyan purging crew to a new world. Sometimes Nappa
regretted the efficiency of his own people; the vermin always died
much too quickly. They should nave suffered more.

<p>Nappa took cold satisfaction in Latta's death; that she-viper died a
peasant's death with the planet, and may Hell take her for the part
she played in Diive's treason!  She'd betrayed her favorite brother
for one reason alone: he was Nappa's favorite as well, and there was
nothing she hated more than her father.  But the others... Chishan
didn't deserve that death, nor did Apio, nor Kimchee, nor Zukini, and
Trigo may have been a young fool, but he deserved at least a warrior's
end. Not this!

<p>General Nappa--no, he was not a general, for there were no warriors left to
command, and he was not Marshal, for there was no king and no kingdom any
more. What, then, was left? He would ask himself that many times
during the coming years.

<p>For now, his duty was to the last of the royal line of Vegetasai,
and whatever the young prince should command. Though the world had
ended amid ashes and despair, honor remained, and honor was a stern
commander. He would not falter; Nappa was an elite warrior of the
nobility, as his father before him and his fathers before him; there
was no other possibility.

<p>
"And?" The young prince answered with cold indifference.

<p>"Uh, nothing in particular. That is all." The older warrior's blood
chilled; in Vegeta's voice he heard not the stoicism of tradition, but
true indifference--the young prince cared for no one and nothing
beyond his own quest for power. If he had become king...
<p>
No. Vegeta was his prince, and Nappa's duty was to the prince,
no matter what. Vegetasai was gone, but there would be survivors,
those who had been purging planets or in space at the time--they would
rebuild, and Vegeta would be the king of a new dynasty on a new world
someday. For now, it was Nappa's duty to make sure the prince survived
to become king.

<p>
It was late, almost midnight by the ship's clock, but
still Prince Vegeta stood watching the stars through the ship's main
observation bubble. Nappa waited patiently beside the door for the
Prince to grant him his attention. At last, the haughty young Saiyan
tore his gaze away from the observation bubble long enough to acknowledge
the giant Saiyan with a glance.
<p>
"What is it, Nappa?" he said in bored tone of voice.

<p>The former general bowed to his prince. "They've found a survivor,
Your Highness. He's just been picked up, and I've given orders for him
to report as soon as he's presentable."

<p>
The boy prince frowned sulkily. "How strong is he?"

<p>"He's supposedly a Royal Guardsman--that means he's at least
first-class." Nappa remained impassive, but his frustration grew. Over
the weeks since the destruction of Vegetasai, reports of "few
survivors" had become "no survivors"; until today, it had appeared
that the two of them were the only Saiyans left in the universe--and
all young Vegeta cared about was how strong the survivor was!  Damn
it, didn't the prince give a damn about the survival of his own race,
and his duty to what was left of his people??

<p>
The door chimed.
<p>
"Let him in," Vegeta said, sounding even more bored than ever.
<p>
The door slid back, and in stepped a tall, young--barely out of
adolescence--Saiyan warrior. A wild crest of hair rose from a sharp
widow's peak and cascaded down his back under its own massive weight;
it brushed the floor as he knelt on one knee before his prince.

<p>Nappa started inwardly; this warrior's hair was so different from
<i>that</i> auburn crest, and his face was delicate and pretty where Diive's
face had been strong and sharply cut, but this young warrior had the
same tall, rangy, muscular build, long tail and unscarred good looks
that his son had had. Nappa's memories of his oldest son
nearly betrayed him; fortunately the former marshal was looking at the
newcomer and away from Vegeta. Only the newcomer noticed the surprise
that flashed across Nappa's face.

<p>
"Guardsman Raditz reporting as ordered, Your Highness."
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>

<p>A month later, Raditz was in the tank for the fifth time. "Your
Highness, why don't you spar with me for a while; Raditz is no
challenge for you," Nappa said, trying to keep any semblance of
pleading out of his voice. Vegeta had savagely beaten the adolescent
Saiyan again, careless of Raditz's relative weakness compared to
himself.

<p>Vegeta sniffed. "Quit whining, Nappa! Of course he's no
challenge--he's weak, with a power level less than 1000. I will make
him stronger or he will die--he's useless if he stays weak."

<p>"Vegeta! There are only three of us left--even a weak Saiyan is
worth something! He's not all that weak for a Saiyan warrior; he's just
not an elite."

<p>"Anyone who cannot survive is worthless," said the young prince
coldly. "The Saiyans of Vegetasai were not strong enough to
survive--even my father was not strong enough!" At the shocked look on
Nappa's face, the boy prince frowned. "Get your head out of the sand,
Nappa--only power matters! Take care of the weakling as you see fit,
and make him strong." Prince Vegeta pointedly turned his back on the
massive Saiyan.

<p>"Thank you, Your Highness." Nappa bowed and hurried off, heading for
sickbay and the regeneration tanks. He was worried about
Raditz; the young warrior had gone from relief at being rescued and
finding other Saiyans to a dark, bitter moodiness. He spoke only when
directly addressed, now, and he fought like he'd forgotten how--or
like he didn't care.

<p>Such negligence had almost cost Raditz his life at Vegeta's hands;
the first time they sparred, the young prince mistook carelessness for
contempt and decided to pay back Raditz for his insolence, slowly and
painfully. Every bone in the warrior's arms and legs had been broken by
the time Nappa intervened. Nappa still didn't know what had driven him
to stop Vegeta; he'd had no intention of risking his life against the
power he feared most in the universe for the sake of one half-dead common
warrior. That was the first time Vegeta put Raditz in the tank, and
Nappa had ended up in the tank next to him.

<p>
A few minutes later Nappa bellowed at a slimy purple alien medical
technician, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HE'S NOT HERE?"
<p>
The alien cringed, terrified by the angry, bellowing Saiyan. "Raditz-san was
released from the tank less than an hour ago, Nappa-san. Perhaps he
has returned to his quarters?"
<p>
"Bah!" Nappa snapped disgustedly, and backhanded the alien across
the room as he stormed out.
<p>
Out in the corridor, he stopped and activated his scouter. Nappa's head
turned slowly as he scanned the ship, looking for Raditz's power
level. There! Power level 992--the boy had gone up a bit from Vegeta's
beating... but what was he doing on the lowest deck of the ship?

<p>Nappa hurried down the corridor toward the nearest lift, trying to
figure out what was significant about the second cargo deck. It was
small, cramped, badly lit, one lift shaft, one airlock, out of the
way--a good place to avoid the rest of the crew, Nappa supposed...

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>

<p>The airlock's inner hatch was open. He found Raditz leaning against
the airlock bulkhead, staring out the porthole in the outer
hatch. Tense fingers gripped the opening lever and released it; the
stout metal bar was twisted and dented from Raditz's grip. The lock
controls had been torn open and wires hung loose.

<p>
"What the hell do you think you're doing, you stupid punk?" Nappa
snarled.
<p>
Raditz turned his head slowly to look at him; Nappa grew angry at the
emptiness in his eyes. This was no way for a Saiyan warrior to be!
<p>
"What do you think, <i>General</i> Nappa?"
<p>
Nappa almost flinched at the mention of his old title; then he nodded
at the wrecked controls. "Something too stupid to be Saiyan. Trying to
override the interlocks? They'll only seal off the deck when the
pressure drops." He growled, fighting the impulse to grab Raditz and
slam him against the bulkhead repeatedly.

<p>Raditz sighed tiredly. "I haven't tampered with the interlocks; I
cut the alarm to the bridge."

<p>"You stupid fool!" Nappa growled, a low, vicious sound.

<p>Raditz looked up at that, startled. Nappa grabbed him by the front
of his armor and slammed him hard against the bulkhead. The young
Saiyan's eyes rolled up as his head bounced off the hard metal surface
and his teeth crashed together, nearly biting off the tip of his
tongue. Blood trickled down one corner of his mouth.

<p>
"You are a Saiyan warrior!" Nappa snarled. "A warrior of the proudest,
deadliest race in the universe! Where is your pride, boy? A Saiyan
never surrenders, never gives up, never gives in!" His backhand blow
caught Raditz across the jaw and bounced him off the outer lock.

<p>Raditz coughed and spit out blood. "What race, Nappa?  Look around;
the proudest race in the universe is DEAD! Vegetasai is GONE, and the
Saiyans are nothing but dust!" He crouched in a fighting stance. "What
good is pride now?"

<p>"While the three of us live, the Saiyan race lives, boy!" Nappa
growled, crouching in fighting stance himself. "This is no death for a
Saiyan; if you're in such a hurry to die, die with the death screams of your
enemies ringing in your ears, and the taste of your life's blood in
your mouth! That is the way a Saiyan dies, Raditz--not alone, and
NEVER without a fight!"

<p>A dangerous light entered Raditz's eyes. "You are right, Nappa--not
without a fight!" he agreed. He wiped the blood from his face, then
lashed out with a sudden kick to Nappa's midsection.

<p>The giant warrior blocked Raditz's strike with casual ease, and
returned the strike. Raditz crashed through the airlock's side
bulkhead with a screech of rending metal; water poured out, flooding
the cargo deck.

<p>
"Idiot. <i>That</i> set off the bridge alarms," the long-haired Saiyan
hissed as he pulled himself painfully out of the breached interhull
water tank.
<p>
Nappa's fist caught him just under the ribs, and Raditz doubled up,
retching. He looked up to see the power gathering in Nappa's hand.

<p>"Too bad for you--I'll kill you myself rather than let
Freiza's lackeys see what a fool you've made of yourself," Nappa
snarled in Raditz's face. "Are you going to let those scum laugh at a
Saiyan dying a coward's death?  ARE YOU?"

<p>Raditz laughed bitterly. "They already laugh at us, Nappa--the
deadly Saiyans, wiped out by an asteroid! They snicker whenever they
see Prince Vegeta, the <i>Crown Prince</i> and Heir, kneel before Master
Frieza; and they laugh like damned demons to see the former Marshal of
Vegetasai bow to Zarbon and Doddoria!" Raditz drew in a painful
breath. "We only have enemies left, Nappa, enemies too powerful to
fight. Even if we had the power to kill them all, everything
worthwhile is still gone."

<p>Nappa doused the gathering energy, and instead thrust his sneering
face into Raditz's. "What was worthwhile for you, boy, beyond
brawling, eating and wenching? You're a low-born, common soldier; you
never had lands and clan and position to lose, <i>boy</i>. You stupid fool,
you're whining about losing what you never had." He punched Raditz in
the face; blood gushed from the younger Saiyan's nose. "Well, there's
plenty of fighting still, and you aren't starving, and there's more
important things than whether or not you get laid."  He backhanded
Raditz again. "You say you were in the Guard, <i>boy</i>--you miss the part
about duty and honor? Death's easy, boy; honor's harder, and duty is
the hardest of all."

<p>"What honor? No one knows or cares." Raditz's voice was low and
bitter. "Who is our duty to? The prince? He serves Frieza, and will
never be king of our dead world. And I will die by my own hand before
I give honor and duty to Frieza!"

<p>Nappa stepped back and folded his arms, glaring at Raditz. "Honor
isn't given to you by others--it's inside, boy. It's what you
<i>know</i> about yourself, about what you know you are supposed to be,
even when no one is looking. How the hell did you manage to finish
training without knowing that?" he growled. "Now you tell me what you
know about the 'honor' of what you're doing now."

<p>Raditz muttered something Nappa couldn't hear, and the giant
scowled. "I didn't hear you."

<p>"I said, it's dishonorable--dishonorable and cowardly." Raditz
snarled at Nappa, "That's what you wanted to hear, isn't it? I'm a
dishonorable coward as well as weak!" Again, he laughed bitterly. "The
proud Saiyan race would be better off without me. Just ask Prince
Vegeta; I'm sure he'd agree with me."

<p>
Nappa kicked Raditz's legs out from under him and then slammed a knee
into the younger warrior's back. Raditz groaned as his ribs cracked
under the impact. Nappa knelt on his back and grabbed a handful of
hair, yanking Raditz's head up and back. His lip curled
up in disgust.

"You will speak of the Prince with respect, boy. You
don't know your duty, either, so I'll tell you again: your duty is to
Prince Vegeta. He is your ruler, and the oaths you swore to
the king belong to him, now. <i>He</i> says whether you live or die, not
you, because your life belongs to him. <i>He is Vegetasai!</i> Do you
understand, boy?"

<p>
Raditz hacked and spit blood across the deck. "I hear what you are
saying."

<p>"But do you <i>understand</i>, boy?" Nappa yanked his head back again,
and ground his knee into Raditz's back, catching the young warrior's
tail between his kneecap and Raditz's spine. What would it take to
get through to this thick-headed young fool?

<p>Raditz shrieked and thrashed helplessly as Nappa crushed his tail
again. Finally Nappa shifted his weight, and Raditz collapsed, panting
hard.

<p>"I.. understand," he gasped. Nappa released his hair, and Raditz's
head dropped to the deck with a thud. He lay unmoving for several
minutes.  Nappa lifted himself off the battered youth and stood,
looking down at him.

"Why you keep calling me 'boy'?" Raditz finally asked as he got his
hands under his body and pushed himself up to his knees. "I'm adult,
and I was sworn into the Guard!"

<p>Nappa snorted. "When you act your age, <i>boy</i>, I'll call you
'warrior'. Until then, you have the name you've earned--<i>boy</i>."  Taut
muscles relaxed the merest trifle; a crisis point had passed, and the
older, more experienced warrior knew it as he watched Raditz struggle
to his feet.

<p>
Raditz's sharp ears picked up the whir of the lift at the far end of
the cargo hold at the same time Nappa's did.

<p>"Company coming." A ki blast destroyed the airlock controls and a
chunk of the bulkhead besides. "Now, what were we arguing about to
cause all this damage?" Raditz smirked, a expression made grisly by
the blood covering his face.

<p>Nappa lunged, and caught Raditz in the ribs with his elbow, sending
him crashing into the nearest pile of cargo. "I was chewing you out
for being so weak and sloppy with the prince; I've seen infants spar
better than that!" Nappa snarled. "One more thing, boy--who were
those scum who dared to mock the Prince? Was it Doddoria or Zarbon?"

<p>
"They don't lower themselves to talk to <i>me</i>," Raditz panted,
staggering to his feet again. "It was the soldiers."
<p>
"Stronger than you?" He feinted at Raditz's midriff, then clipped
Raditz on the jaw again.
<p>
"No." Raditz stayed down this time, rubbing his jaw as a trio of
brightly hued aliens rushed up, yelling indignantly.
<p>
Nappa smirked. "You know what to do, then--<i>warrior</i>."
<p>
"Hey! You can't fight down here, that's what the training rooms are
for, who's going to fix all this damage? What the--"
<p>
Raditz pulled himself to his feet and glared at the smaller aliens. A
ball of energy formed in his hand, and Raditz flung it at the alien
who'd spoken. BOOM! The unfortunate alien slumped against the wall in
a smouldering heap.
<p>
"Anyone else got a complaint?" Raditz smirked that dangerous Saiyan smirk.
<p>
"Ah, no, we'll just clean up when you're done, okay?"  The loudest of
the remaining aliens backed quickly away.
<p>
Nappa smirked as the aliens backed away from Raditz. Yeah, the boy's
remembered he's a Saiyan warrior. He'll do. He's not Diive, he'll
never be Diive, but he could have been one of my other sons: Chisan,
Col, Apio or Trigo--well, not Trigo, even Raditz has more sense than
Trigo had...
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>

<p>Twenty-four years later Raditz knelt before his prince--and dropped
a bombshell. "I found out where my little brother was sent; there's a
chance Kakarott survived."

<p>
"What??" Prince Vegeta looked sharply at Raditz. "How? All the
offworld Saiyans were accounted for, and no one who was on-planet
survived."
<p>
Raditz still knelt before Vegeta. "Kakarott was sent off in his
capsule shortly before the catastrophe--there were no offworld
records, except by accident. No one saw anything important in
those records until I came across them." Raditz shrugged.

<p>Nappa scowled; he understood the boy's hope, but it just wasn't
realistic.  "In twenty-four years he never signaled for pick-up? He's
dead."

<p>
Vegeta frowned at Raditz. "How old was your little brother?"
<p>
Raditz's fingers flexed. "Less than a year old," he rasped.

<p>"As I thought--a weakling. Too feeble for even the common soldiery,
so he was sent off to a weak planet. Feh." Vegeta sneered. "Nappa is
probably right; and even if he's wrong, Kakarott would be too weak to
be of use."

<p>"Vegeta, he's still a Saiyan," Nappa growled. After
twenty-four years, hope of reviving the Saiyan race had long since
died--yet Vegeta's contempt goaded Nappa into contrariness.  If even
one more Saiyan was alive, that was one more warrior, and where
one had survived, perhaps more--perhaps even a woman might have
survived, somewhere! It wouldn't hurt to check; couldn't Vegeta see
how important this was?

<p>Nappa noticed the stricken look that flashed across Raditz's
face. This is personal for the boy, he thought. Nappa still thought of
Raditz as his boy, though the long-haired Saiyan was a good fifteen
years into his fighting prime as a warrior--and he would have long since
taken a mate and sired children in the normal course of things. He'd
grown into a strong and capable warrior, though Nappa wished he'd
learn to hide his feelings a little better. Raditz always had such an
open face; Nappa sometimes felt embarassed for the boy, always
revealing his emotions to anyone who watched him.

<p>
He was embarassed now; Vegeta had also seen the unhappiness on
Raditz's face.

<p>Vegeta smiled cruelly. "You can go... but only if you come back with
Kakarott."

<p>"But... what if he's dead, or--" Raditz protested.

<p>"--Make sure he's not," Vegeta said with that same cruel smile, "or
you'll be a deserter." With a wave of his hand, the former Crown
Prince dismissed Raditz from his presence.

<p>As the door closed behind Raditz, Nappa had an odd feeling of
foreboding, like he was about to lose another son.

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>

<p>
Nearly a year later, Nappa sat beside a campfire feasting on the
half-cooked carcass of some insectoid creature, listening to the drama
unfolding on the scouter's hyperwave channel. He stopped eating, and
all but held his breath as the last frantic shouts echoed in his
ears--then the sickening howl of a high-energy ki blast. The mighty
Saiyan's appetite suddenly vanished as he watched the telemetry
readings plummet like a stone, and heard those last, agonized words.
Finally---
<p>
"Raditz... is dead," Nappa informed his Prince, his face impassive.
My boy is dead, he thought. They're all dead. I've lived too long;
a man should not outlive all his children.
<p>
Vegeta spat out a chunk of shell, and bit off another hunk of the
chitinous creature. "He deserved it... killed by power levels barely
over a thousand."

<p>A sense of failure weighed on Nappa. All these years... I taught him
nothing. Vegeta chose a different path, Frieza's path. Only Raditz
listened to me all these years, and...

<p>
Nappa's great fingers flexed, but he managed to keep his voice
neutral. "We can leave this planet for later," he hinted. No matter
how weak you thought he was, Prince Vegeta, Raditz was a Saiyan. He
must not lie unavenged! Did I at least teach you Saiyan honor?
<p>
"Hmmm..." Vegeta said thoughtfully, chewing the gristly foothand of
the insect thing. "These 'dragonballs' sound intriguing... make any
wish come true."
<p>
The prince stood abruptly, his decision made. "Let's go."
<p>
Nappa was careful to keep the relief off his face. "To bring Raditz
back to life?"
<p>
Vegeta, Prince of the Saiyans, looked scornfully at Nappa. "Get real.
That would be a waste of a wish; we're better off without
him. Instead, how about immortality for ourselves?  No death, no
aging, only an eternity of combat!" Vegeta smiled evilly.
<p>
Nappa always excelled at hiding his true feelings; an eternity of
hopelessness and grief, of broken pride, of empty honor and
meaningless duty? Nevertheless, his response was truthful:
<p>
"Ah..! Now <i>that's</i> a wish!!"
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>

<p>Just before the pod's hibernation systems kicked in, Vegeta remarked
on the power of Raditz's attackers. "The child's power was
impossibly high for a Saiyan child."

<p>Nappa growled into the communicator. "Raditz's scouter was
malfunctioning!" The very idea of a hybrid Saiyan-alien child revolted
him. Such things weren't possible!--Yet, if they were...

<p>"I don't think so, not with the amount of damage Raditz suffered
from that one strike," mused Vegeta. "It seems that mixing Saiyan and
Earthling blood begets a powerful hybrid."

<p>Nappa folded his arms and swallowed the bitter words that he wanted
to scream at Vegeta. His duty was more important than his hatred;
Prince Vegeta had noted the obvious, and was finally seeing his
duty. When the giant Saiyan spoke, his words were calm and reasoned.

<p>"A Super-Saiyan, eh? So if we spawn a flock of them ourselves, we
could build another Saiyan Empire!"

<p>Vegeta's answer was cold and crushing. "Don't be stupid! Do you want
a lot of ingrate brats running around with powers greater than <i>ours</i>?
We must exterminate all life on Earth!"

<p>Nappa's hate burned hot in agreement: destroy the world that killed
his boy, and murder the race that had seduced Kakarott the way that other
race had seduced and destroyed his son Diive! Another part of Nappa,
the part that had held to duty and honor for so many years, in the
face of losing everything, turned cold and empty; Vegeta hungered only
for his own power, and cared nothing for the Saiyan race, for his
<i>people</i>.

<p>"Oh. Right." Nappa answered.

<p>I tried to teach him the traditions of a dead race, and the duties
of an prince without a kingdom; Frieza taught him power and
fear. Vegetasai is forgotten dust, while Vegeta kneels before the
Horned One's throne every day. How could I compete with Frieza?
Despair and darkness closed in on him as the pod's hibernation system
finally activated.

<p>
One year later, Nappa smirked evilly as the green alien greeted them.

<p>
"Let's make this clear: what exactly do you want here?" asked Piccolo.

<p>
"Ah, that voice... it was <i>you</i> who killed Raditz, wasn't it?"
observed Vegeta in that deceptively gentle voice of his, the voice of
a cat toying with its mouse.

<p>"Voice?" answered the green creatures, surprised. There was
something familiar about the color and shape--Nappa had seen his kind
before.

<p>"Didn't Raditz tell you?" Vegeta asked in mock surprise. "This," he
indicated his scouter with a finger, "also serves as a transmitter."

<p>
"He's a Namek," Nappa observed.

<p>"Looks like it. Not so strange that Raditz was beaten, then,"
allowed Vegeta.

<p>A queer sense of relief ran through Nappa--Raditz had not
fallen to a dishonorably weak enemy. A Namek warrior was a worthy
opponent; there was no longer any shame in Raditz's defeat. His boy
had died well, fighting a stronger warrior--and he would be avenged.

<p>Nappa amused himself with thoughts of revenge while Vegeta tried to
find out if the Namek made the dragonballs, and the other Earthling
babbled uselessly. Which one would he kill first? The kid, or the Namek,
or the babbler?"

<p>"...You know about the dragonballs?" The small babbling one gaped.

<p>"Why else would we bother with this dump?" Nappa sneered. Earth
really was a valuable planet, but the giant warrior was not going to
let the vermin get inflated ideas about themselves. "Hand them over!"

<p>A belated thought occurred to him. They probably thought Vegeta was
hesitating because the prince feared the Namek! That was unthinkable.

<p>"Bring on all the Nameks you can find!" Nappa challenged. "They're
just slugs to us!"

<p>"...alas for me, however, I did not make the dragonballs. My
speciality.. is combat!" Piccolo hissed at Vegeta, crouching in a fighting
stance. "As you will see. <i>Now</i>, who is a slug?"

<p>Vegeta looked bored. "If you won't tell us where the dragonballs
are, we'll just have to beat it out of you."

<p>Nappa watched his scouter's power indicator with contempt. What did
these vermin think they were challenging?  "981.. 1220.. 1083.. FOOLS!
Do ya really think you can beat us with power levels like those?"

<p>Vegeta pursed his lips. "Nappa, take off your scouter."

<p>"What?" the giant said, rattled. He was even more startled as Vegeta
removed his own scouter and dropped it.

<p>"These scum vary their power numbers to suit the battle. Those
numbers are meaningless."

<p>"Yeah.. that's right." Obediently, Nappa removed the scouter. So
that's what happened, Raditz--you got careless, depending on your
scouter.  Nappa smirked evilly. These dogs are cocky, now--they killed
a Saiyan, and they think they're tough. Let's rattle their cages a
bit.

<p>"That <i>weakling</i> Raditz probably got himself killed because he
depended on the scouter's numbers--and got caught off guard." Nappa
sneered.

<p>Oh, that got them! It was worth it, the insult to his boy; the
vermin weren't so cocky now. They didn't run, but Nappa was
satisfied for the present. They'd learn to respect Saiyan strength
yet.

<p>If only Vegeta hadn't smirked with such satisfied contempt when
Nappa called Raditz a weakling...

<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>

<p>
The cultivars were dead. One--just one!--of the arrogant Earthlings
was dead, though his death shook up the vermin. Oh yes, they were
finally beginning to understand Saiyan might.

<p>"Let me do it," Nappa requested his prince. "I'll kill all five of
them at once."

<p>Vegeta smiled with amusement. "As you will."

<p>At last! The giant Saiyan braced himself, and raised his power. As
the earth shook, dismay filled his enemies, and a fierce delight
filled the huge warrior. Nappa would show Raditz's killers the true
power of a Saiyan elite--and they would pay for his boy's life!

<p>Two more of the vermin died fighting Nappa--strangely, the weakest
one did the most damage. Nappa's armor was blown apart and his
back singed by the self-destructive blast of the white
child-thing--but he survived, and the tiny horror was blown to
oblivion. The three-eyed alien had been shaken, and had attacked
wildly, uncaring of itself, spending its very life to kill Nappa.

<p>It had failed. Nappa smirked triumphantly--until the Namek grabbed
his tail.  A vicious, vulgar tactic--and one that Nappa was ready for,
having woven a ki-shield around the vulnerable appendage as a matter
of course. Did these fools really think a veteran like Nappa would
make the same stupid mistake Raditz had? He slammed his elbow into the
Namek's skull, crumpling the rubbery dome and slamming the creature
into the ground.

<p>
"Bah! Not even the toughest guy on this planet can survive one punch,"
Nappa growled as Piccolo collapsed to the ground. "Well, if he's gonna
take a nap, I guess I have to play with his little friends." Nappa
laughed cruelly, stalking past Piccolo toward Kakarott's terrified
son.

<p>"You're Kakarott's son, you've got Saiyan blood in you, too. Give me
a real fight, brat." Nappa growled as Gohan cowered. This pathetic
creature nearly killed Raditz by himself? Bah! Raditz's scouter must
have been broken. He would enjoy killing the brat--slowly. The brat's
terror delighted him; the creature was frozen in absolute panic. Nappa
wanted much more than that; he wanted to feel the child's bones break
in his hands, and he wanted to hear the brat scream himself hoarse in
pain and fear before Nappa finally burned him to ash.

<p>
"Heh. What a father you've got," Nappa sneered, "leaving his little boy
to die."
<p>
The brutal kick sent Gohan arcing high into the air, only to be met by
Nappa's follow-up strike, which sent him hurtling through the air to
slam into a nearby rock formation.  The child slid limply to the ground.
<p>
"Hey, don't die yet! I want to play!" Nappa mocked. This has
only just begun, brat. Don't you dare cheat me of my revenge by dying
this easily!
<p>
Gohan twitched, and slowly pulled himself to his feet, coughing blood
and dust. He swayed on his feet, gasping for breath--and something was
different. The wide-eyed, frozen panic was gone; in its place, anger
gathered.
<p>
In spite of himself, Nappa grinned. The boy was a Saiyan, after all!
"There you go--fight like a Saiyan!" Nappa lunged forward with a
sudden burst of speed, closing for the kill. "AND DIE LIKE ONE!"
<p>
"YOU BASTARD!" With unexpected speed, the small bald Earthling slammed
into Nappa, kicking him in the jaw with all his strength. His
follow-through sent Nappa careening across the battlefield...
<p>
The fight continued, though Kulilin's ki-enzan nearly finished
it--only Vegeta's warning shout saved Nappa from beheading. Piccolo's
blast finally cracked Nappa's defenses, enough to hurt and enrage the
huge warrior--then everything stopped.
<p>
"Wh-what? A tremendous power approaching from afar!" Piccolo
exclaimed.
<p>
Battered Gohan looked up. "I feel it, too. It's huge, but it's
familiar!"
<p>
Piccolo smirked, baring sharp fangs. "At last--it's him! SON GOKU IS
COMING!" He snarled. "I should have known that fool would make us
wait!"
<p>
"Daddy! Daddy's coming! Hurry, Daddy!" Gohan shouted.
<p>
Nappa paused, too. Had his enemies all gone mad? "Kakarott? Where?"
<p>
"Interesting. They seem to have the power to detect ki," Vegeta
commented as he picked up his scouter. "Let's see..." There was a beep
as Vegeta turned it on.
<p>
Vegeta's eyes widened; for the first time in Nappa's memory, the
Saiyan prince was speechless.

<p>
"Vegeta! Are they telling the truth? I hope they are. Heh." At last,
he would get his hand on the traitor who'd betrayed his own kind,
preferring alien weaklings to his own brother!

<p>
"I don't know if it's really Kakarott," Vegeta said slowly, "but
whoever it is will be here in four minutes--with a power level of
five thousand!"
<p>
Nappa's jaw dropped. "Five thousand? That's impossible! It has to be a
mistake! Your scouter is broken!"
<p>
"It may be," Vegeta mused. "These fools seem to be able to vary their
power level, so... five thousand could be just for starters."

<p>Nappa suddenly felt light-headed. It was impossible! Before the
prince's birth, Nappa had been the second strongest Saiyan on the
Vegetasai--only the king had been stronger--and he was the strongest
Saiyan ever born outside of the royal family! There was no way some
low-class soldier's brat could even come close to Nappa's power--no
way at all!

<p>
"Heheh. I do believe your partner's actually worried," said the
insidious Namek.
<p>
Vegeta clenched his fist. "NAPPA! Kill those two NOW! Their help could
actually make Kakarott a challenge--but their corpses will shake him
up!"
<p>
"But--the dragonballs? How will we--?" Nappa was bewildered; the
dragonballs had been Vegeta's goal from the beginning!
<p>
"Never mind that! We don't need them!" Vegeta snapped. "I never
believed the legend of the Namek Power Spheres, but if Kakarott has
returned from the dead, then it's true. There must be more dragonballs
on the slug's home planet--a little rampage on Namek would be a lovely
way to wind down after the destruction of Earth, don't you think?"

<p>"I still say your scouter's broken; Kakarott can't be five
thousand--but's it's a good enough excuse to start the killing!"
snarled Nappa. Finally, he could send that damned Namek to hell and
avenge his boy!

<p>
"Piccolo--you've got to run!" Gohan shouted. "I'll hold 'em somehow
until Daddy comes! If you die, then Earth's Kami-Sama will die, and
the dragonballs!"
<p>
"Feh. Don't be ridiculous, boy. You can't hold them alone," said
Piccolo, an odd smile on his face.

<p>An old memory suddenly flashed across Nappa's mind, a memory of a
younger Raditz standing over his wounded body and screaming at him to
get to his pod, that he'd hold off the bastards long enough for Nappa
to get away! He'd said much the same thing to Raditz those twenty
years ago: Don't be a fool, boy! You've a tenth of my strength on your
best day, and you think you'll hold off something that knocked <i>me</i> down?

<p>
"So," Nappa smirked evilly, "the little lad's going to hold <i>me</i>, eh?"
He charged. "DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH!"

<p>The brat hit him. The blow slammed Nappa's jaw around with
neck-wrenching force, and sent him crashing into a nearby mesa. <i>This</i>
was the power that nearly killed Raditz--no, much stronger. This
blow would have killed Raditz instantly. The brat was strong, far
stronger than any Saiyan child had ever been--except for one. That one
was Prince Vegeta.

<p>NO!! No filthy half-breed alien could equal the power of the
greatest Prince of the Saiyans! And no worthless half-breed whelp was
going to kill his boy and draw his blood without paying in full. Power
crackled around Nappa's hand as he drew it back, readying for the
attack.

<p>
"DIE!!" The bolt of white energy flashed from Nappa's hand toward the
half-alien whelp. Nappa could see the terror of death in the
vile little brat's eyes, just like he'd seen it in the eyes of those
others, the lavender-hued bitch and her whelp, who'd seduced and
doomed his son Diive...

<p>
SHKOOOOM! Nappa's eyes widened; at the last instant, the Namek leaped
into the path of his attack, blocking the deadly blast from harming
the brat. Nappa grinned as the scorched Namek staggered and fell,
cooked alive by the deadly blast.

<p>
"Piccolo?" Gohan staggered to his feet, pleading. "Why--why did you
save me?"

<p>"Run... G-go... han. H.. hurry." Piccolo gasped.

<p>"P-please! Don't die, Piccolo! Daddy will come soon!" Gohan begged,
crouching next to the dying Namek warrior.

<p>
"Idiots--making me kill them in the wrong order," Nappa snarled. "Oh
well, it all ends up the same." The giant Saiyan watched the brat
<i>crying</i> over the fading warrior with disgust. The half-breed was
completely corrupted--crying like a weakling over this alien
scum! Raditz had been a fool to risk himself over the brat; there was
nothing Saiyan about it.
<p>
Piccolo breathed his last, and Nappa smirked in satisfaction. Raditz's
killer was dead; his boy would have company in hell.
<p>
Then the child screamed. "YAAAA! NOOOO!" Vegeta's scouter beeped in
warning as Gohan's power skyrocketed and the boy howled in pure Saiyan
rage--

<p>
--"Power twenty-eight hundred!" the Saiyan prince exclaimed.

<p>Nappa grinned, his eye alight with the fire of battle. "Twenty-eight
hundred, eh?" Maybe Raditz wasn't such a fool after all. The brat's
got the power of an elite Saiyan--but not elite enough.

<p>With a shout, Nappa caught Gohan's powerful blast--a blast that
would have vaporized Raditz and all six of the cultivars--and bounced
it away. It exploded, making yet another huge crater in the
battlefield.

<p>"Heh. That actually stung a bit," Nappa said, still grinning. "Not
bad, for a shrimp." The boy was shaking, barely able to stand. What
the--?

<p>"His power dropped all the way down," Vegeta observed, answering
Nappa's unvoiced question. "It seems he used it all up just now."

<p>"I'm sorry, Piccolo," Gohan whimpered, collapsing to his
knees. "I.. I couldn't beat 'em for you. I c-can't even run away
anymore."

<p>Nappa laughed cruelly as he advanced on the helpless child. "I can't
wait to see Kakarott's face when he finds his son crushed to a pulp!"
This is for my sons, brat--and you'll die far easier than Diive did.
<p>
The blow never landed.
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>

<p>It was shameful enough that that low-class traitor brother of
Raditz's fought him to a standstill... but then Vegeta called him off,
in public, in front of non-Saiyans! No! Not after two decades of
swallowing his pride, of bending his knee to that monster Frieza, of
enduring the mockery of Frieza's syncophants--he would <i>not</i> yield to
these weaklings! He would show them the price for mocking a
Saiyan warrior, and his sons would be avenged!

<p>"Curse you... curse you to hell, boy," Nappa growled, a vicious,
hate-filled sound, "for making me surrender your execution to Vegeta."
He flashed a brief, cruel grin. "Heh. You'll be damned sorry it ever
happened. There's a reason he's named after Vegetasai itself. I'll
leave you to him because he ordered me to--but I won't be satisfied
with leaving things as they are."

<p>No matter what else happeed, the brat would die. Nappa did not see
Raditz's nephew; he saw a soft-hearted, <i>weak</i> half-breed, the child
of the soft-hearted traitor Kakarott and some weak Earth woman--just
like the soft-hearted, weak alien woman and her cursed child who had
corrupted his son Diive, making him soft-hearted and turning him
against his own kind... Because of <i>her</i>, Nappa had put his favorite son to
death as a traitor; because of her, his beloved Rashi died offworld,
far from his arms; because of <i>this</i> brat, his adopted son Raditz died
uselessly on this weak, soft world. Damn them all, damn them all to
Hell!

<p>Nappa charged for the brat and the bald midget, readying his
deadliest ki blast--

<p>
"KAIO-KEN!"
<p>
--Kakarott broke his back.
<p>
Humiliated and defeated, his broken body flung at Prince Vegeta's feet,
Nappa could only beg for help, like the lowliest, most dishonorable
weakling of a last-class soldier. His Saiyan pride and honor were both
gone; the only thing left was his duty to his Prince... if only
Vegeta could get him to his capsule, on life support, back to Base 79,
a tank would fix everything, he would <i>not</i> fail in his duty!
<p>
He reached eagerly for the proffered hand, willfully ignoring the cold
contempt and rage in Vegeta's eyes--

<p>--and realized, too late, as Vegeta flung him high into the air that
he <i>had</i> truly and completely failed in his duty--for the prince cared
nothing for Saiyan honor.

<p>An instant later, there was nothing left at all.

<p><I>"Nappa? If you could have any wish granted, what would you wish for?"
</I></p>

<p><I>"Raditz? RADITZ!! Where have you been? They said you were alive, but
I didn't believe it. I knew you were gone like Bardock and Sullion and
Kale..."
</I></p>

<p><I>"Bardock is gone?!? Yes, he would be... Nappa--I am alive."
</I></p>
<p><I>"You're alive? What are you doing here?"
</I></p>
<p><I>"I'm not exactly here, and you're not exactly there. I needed to talk
to you; I need to know about the wish. Just don't ask for all
Vegetasai back--I already tried that. It didn't work."
</I></p>
<p><I>"You're alive... and you have the Dragonballs? You could make any
wish! Why waste your wish on me?"
</I></p>
<p><I>"It's not a waste."
</I></p>
<p><I>"You're alive, Raditz! Use the wish to give yourself a real future!"
</I></p>
<p><I>"Heh. I don't need to; I already have a future, a good one.
Tell me your wish; I can't stay here that long."
</I></p>

<p><I>A long silence. "I think my wish has already been granted."
</I></p>
<p><I>A sharp Saiyan smile. "Don't tell me that was your only wish,
Nappa. I know you better than that."
</I></p>
<p><I>Another silence. "Let me talk to him. I don't know where he is, or how, or if
he'll even listen to me, just let me talk to my son again. Let me talk
to Diive."
</I></p>
<p>
