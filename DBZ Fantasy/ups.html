<h3><b><font color="#2F69A8" face="Arial">Power-Ups and Transformations</font></b>
</h3>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Many deciding factors happen in DBZ,
 and the majority of them are decided by changes in people, making them
 stronger, or faster. This page outlines transformations, techniques,
 and power-ups that were used to increase peoples power.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Absorption</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">One
 of the more powerful foes faced by the Z soldiers was capable of
 gaining huge power ups via absorption. Cell was his name, and he was a
 collection of DNA from the best warriors in the galaxy. He had a tail
 which allowed him to absorb people, and the androids, which made him
 unbelievably powerful in comparison to everyone else. The increases
 that he gains rivals that of Super Saiyans. If he is hit hard enough
 though, he will regurgitate a product of the absorption, such as an
 android, and become less powerful. Cell has 3 forms, reaching the
 perfect form by absorbing #18.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Guru
 Charge-Up</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">This
 is a major power-up gained by only the most noble warriors, with a
 pure heart, and good intentions. Guru releases the hidden potential
 inside the person he is doing it on, giving them an extra power, like
 more strength, or healing capabilities if they had the potential to do
 that. He does this on Gohan and Krillen and gives them huge strength
 boosts, but when he does it on Dende, he gives him the aforementioned
 healing power.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Kai-O-Ken&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">One
 of Goku's most useful allies, an awesome attack taught to him by the
 martial arts master King Kai. It increases everything massively,
 including his speed, reflexes, even sight and hearing. The user is
 surrounded in a red aura, which is so intense that it destroys
 everything around them, and even begins to rip into their clothes. The
 major disadvantage is that even a Saiyans body can't sustain very much
 of it, and will explode if any attempts are made at a level of
 Kai-o-ken which is too much for the level of the user. Even with this
 major weakness, the kai-o-ken was a huge ally all the way through the
 DBZ series, with Goku using it a lot in the Earth-saving battles he
 had.&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px">&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Ki
 Absorption</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">This
 is an extremely useful technique used by the androids where they
 absorb the energy from any living thing. For instance, they could grab
 a powerful fighter, and drain him of his incredibly strength, being
 given it as his own. Dr Gero and #19 are the ones who perform these
 moves, with Gero physically grabbing the enemy and literally sucking
 the life out of them with his hands. #19 has a similar technique too.
 Another pro of the energy absorption is that it can be done against ki
 attacks. An example of this is when #19 used a device in his hand to
 suck in Goku's KameHameHa, and use it to boost his power greatly. Gero
 could also do this, making them both very powerful opponents, with
 limitless potential.</font></p>

 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Machio
 Star Power Up</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">In
 the Garlic Jr. saga, there was a small, red planet called the Machio
 star, which gave huge power ups to any evil-doers, allowing them to
 become infinitely more powerful. This is an incredibly useful thing,
 which can give great tactical advantages, especially when it gets
 close to Earth, making the evil people even stronger, able to
 transform into something similar to ascended Saiyan, with huge
 muscles, and loads of power.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Namekian
 Fusion</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
 fusion between Nameks is slightly different to the other kinds. Rather
 than merging into one completely new being, Nameks fuse into one
 another, with one being the base, and one submitting their power and
 knowledge into that person. An example of this is when Piccolo fused
 with Kami, he was given his wise knowledge, and extra strength, but
 still had complete control over his thoughts and actions.&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">From
 what has been said by people such as Piccolo and Kami, it seems that
 it is possible for the Nameks to split at anytime they feel like,
 although they never do. It seems as though a slight appearance change
 is apparent, with their facial features shifting slightly, so that it
 is almost unnoticeable. Anyone familiar with 'Kamiccolo' would have
 noticed this.&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">For
 the actual fusion to start, the base Namek puts his hand on the other
 Namek, and they fuse into one, with the body of the Namek submitting
 his power disappearing. This method has it's strengths and weaknesses,
 but it's main ones is that it lasts a lot longer, albeit not making
 the product of the fuse as strong as in the Saiyan one.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Oozaru</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">When
 a Saiyan looks up at a full moon, and has a tail, then a strange
 transformation occurs. They become even more violent, and most lose
 control of their actions, becoming a terrible destructive force.
 Vegeta is the only know person who can control themselves after
 transforming into an Oozaru. The biggest strength of turning into one
 of these giant ape-like creatures is that your fighting power is
 increased 10 fold, and you are even faster, despite your intimidating
 size. Without a tail or the moon, a Saiyan cannot maintain, or turn
 into their Oozaru state, meaning they are degraded back into their
 normal form, losing a lot of energy in doing so.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Saiyan
 Fusion</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">This
 technique makes the users far stronger, as they fuse temporarily into
 one being. It only works if the two people are at around the same
 strength when reenacting the dance of wearing the earrings. Fusion can
 be accomplished in one of two ways, which are the aforementioned dance
 and earring methods.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">With
 the Pottara earrings, the two wearers must put on on their
 corresponding ear to their counterpart. They will then automatically
 be fused into one until they remove the earrings. Goku and Vegeta used
 this technique to get inside Buu, but Vegeta crushed his earring when
 they had separated, leaving no hope of fusing by that method.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
 fusion dance is a lot less complex, and it involves the people
 involved doing a short, symmetrical sequence of movements, rather like
 a dance, thus the name. They then join forefingers, and merge into
 one. This lasts for a certain amount of time, varying on the strength
 of the people who participated in the dance. Usually it is only about
 20 minutes though. As with the earrings, the two Saiyans must be at
 approximately the same strength for it work correctly. Of course, as
 with anything, mistakes can be made, with devastating consequences.
 Many a time has come when people have messed up, and created a fat, or
 thin entity not even close to having the power as they had alone. Fat
 Gogetta is an example of this, but when it works, the fusion can be
 deadly, as Super Saiyan Gogetta proved. Gotenks was the only fused
 Saiyan to reach SSJ3.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Super
 Android</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">Not
 many people are aware of this transformation, as it only happens in a
 film, and in Dragonball GT. It happens from a technique which is
 extremely similar to fusion, where the android absorbs parts of other
 androids in order to gain a power up and become even more of a
 monster. Because of the way Dr Gero built #13, he was able to use the
 parts of the other dead androids to make him far stronger, turning
 into an almost unstoppable force, far stronger than even a Super
 Saiyan. There doesn't seem to be any downside to this form either,
 other than a sudden uncontrollable urge for violence, but as it isn't
 a very likely occurrence for androids not to be violent, it doesn't
 really matter. The first Super Androids appeared in Movie 7: The Three
 Super Saiyan, and as already mentioned, it was #13.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Super
 Saiyan</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
 Super Saiyan is easily the most popular power up, or indeed
 transformation, made famous by Goku back in the Namek saga. A legend
 until then, it was unheard of that anyone could ever possibly possess
 the power of a Super Saiyan, which is why Frieza destroyed the planet
 Vegeta, he was scared, and for good reason too. When a Saiyan
 transforms into this state, their eyes turn green, and their hair
 sticks up and goes blonde. The power increase they receive really is
 immense, possibly the biggest of any transformation in Dragonball Z.&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">To
 become a Super Saiyan, you must first have a pure heart, either a
 goodly pure, or a pure evil one. Secondly you must have already
 achieved incredible power, superior to that of almost everyone else's.
 The final step is overwhelming anger, not usually possessed until a
 loved one is killed, or a series of terrible events happen. When the
 transformation occurs though, the Saiyans go ballistic, and fight with
 anger in their heart. With time, the level of Super Saiyan (Or SSJ as
 it is commonly referred to as) can be controlled, and the anger in
 your heart can be diminished. An interesting fact is that you cannot
 form a Spirit Bomb whilst you are SSJ, due to the rage being too much.
 Goku was the first ever Super Saiyan, and it can be debated as to
 whether Trunks or Vegeta was second, as Trunks was second one seen,
 but in his timeline he would have been forth had the events gone the
 same as the real one.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Size
 Transformation</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">Some
 people, mainly Nameks, can increase their size and power. This isn't
 really in the same category as the traditional transformation that it
 mentioned below, as the appearance of the caster never changes, only
 the size does. Piccolo uses this against Goku in the late stages of
 Dragonball, and against Garlic Jr. about midway through Dragonball Z.
 It makes them stronger, but a little sluggish, which is why it isn't
 utilized very often. It can also expose many vulnerable weaknesses.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Transformation</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">Some
 warriors have the ability to condense their power in weaker forms, as
 their real appearance has power that is too radical to control. People
 with this ability can change at will, and it varies from being a
 lengthy transformation, to a very quick, somewhat hasty one. Zarbon
 and Frieza both had this power, and they utilized it to its full
 extent before eventually being defeated. When at their most powerful
 form, it is assumed that the person in control can demote their power
 back down to their energy conserving form, but there is nothing to
 prove it in Frieza's case.&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">Some
 of the transformations that occur give only a minor power boost,
 whilst others increase every single factor significantly, such as
 speed, strength, power, etc.</font>
