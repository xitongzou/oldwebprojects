<h3><b><font color="#2F69A8" face="Arial">Types of Dragonball Z/GT Training</font></b>
</h3>
		  
  </center>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In this section you
 will find all of the types of training, and tutors from the start of
 Dragonball to the end of Dragonball Z. I hope to make this as detailed
 as possible, and provide a good, informative guide for all involved.
 The title of each method of training involves the name of the person,
 or people who actually taught the person how to train. I have put them
 all into chronological order.</font></p>
 <h4><font face="Arial" color="#2F69A8">Dragonball Training</font></h4>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Grandpa
 Gohan's Training</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">When
 Goku was discovered as a baby, his obvious skill was seen by his
 adopted father, and he taught him the basics of martial arts, helping
 him learn many techniques when he was just a young child. It could be
 said that this was Goku's foundation, and as Gohan was trained by
 Master Roshi, Goku would have learnt a style that was very similar. It
 takes him a while, but after his granddads death, and during his
 pre-teen years, Goku surpassed Gohan in terms of strength, becoming a
 better fighter than his former trainer after being taught some more
 skills by other martial arts masters.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Oorinji
 Temple Training</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">This
 was the initial training of Krillen. It was a style learnt by monks,
 and he was there for 8 years, but little else is known about this kind
 of martial arts. It is the foundation of which Krillen built his
 skills on, but he eventually left the temple because he was sick of
 people making fun of his size deficiency. We can assume that it didn't
 take him very long to become stronger than the monks of the temple, as
 very little is said about them after this point.&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px">&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Master
 Roshi's Training</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">This
 was the style taught to Goku and Krillen, and whilst it wasn't so much
 martial arts as tough chores, it was incredibly hard, and increased
 the two kids strength dramatically. The two young boys were so
 desperate to become stronger, that they were willing to plough fields
 with their bare hands, and deliver milk with 20kg turtle shells
 hoisted on their backs. After the training though, their strength
 nearly tripled. It took until adulthood for Krillen to become stronger
 than Roshi, but Goku managed it in the early years of his childhood,
 during a martial arts where he faced Roshi's (Jackie Chun's) conqueror
 - Tien, and almost won.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">Roshi
 trained Yamcha a bit later on too, with Goku deciding to go his own
 way.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Karin's
 Training</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">To
 train under the powerful cat, Goku had to climb the whole column, a
 huge tower, without any help, and get to the top. Whilst there he had
 to take the holy water from Karin, and drink it for a massive strength
 boost. This was a clever ploy though, as the holy water was just
 ordinary water, but the combatant greatly increased their strength
 trying to take it. It took Goku three days, and his strength massively
 increased, making him powerful enough to beat Tao-Pie-Pie. It took
 Master Roshi 3 years to accomplish the same task against Karin.&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">Another
 thing that Goku got off Karin to increase his strength was the 'drink
 of the Gods'. He battled for days on end attempting to hang onto his
 life after consuming the venomous fluid, but after he had managed to
 cling onto his life for long enough, the effects disappeared, and he
 was left an awful lot stronger, able to beat Piccolo Daimao. Goku was
 the only one able to take this drink.</font></p>

 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Tsurusennin's
 Training&nbsp;</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">It
 is not known when in the timeline that this happens, but it is known
 that this guy was trained by the same person as Master Roshi, but has
 a very different teaching style. He is ruthless, and has very little
 honor. His best students were Chao-zu and Tien, of whom learnt their
 base fighting style from him. He is later abandoned by his pupils due
 to them realizing his evil ways.&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px">&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Kami's
 Training</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
 first person to train with God was Goku, being the owner of the
 extending pole that is fixed to the top of Karin's tower, and goes all
 the way up to Kami's lookout. When Goku arrived, he met Mr. Popo, who
 was far stronger than him, and then the Namek Kami, who was
 ridiculously strong for this point in DBZ. Goku was taught mainly how
 to stay calm, and to visualize winning. Whilst strength wasn't a major
 factor is the training, it helped Goku control his power a lot more,
 and become less naive. He trained here for 3 years, and his strength
 was improved dramatically, making him far stronger than anyone else,
 even Piccolo. He even surpassed Kami's strength during this time,
 without God even noticing.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Piccolo's
 Self-Training</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">After
 being spat out as an egg from his father, Piccolo inherited all of his
 power, and trained intensively in the woodlands in order to achieve
 the strength necessary to defeat Goku. He pushed himself past any
 ordinary limits, and really did become a whole lot stronger. He learnt
 some new techniques in the time he spent alone too, teaching himself,
 with hate and resentment pushing him all the way.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px">&nbsp;</p>
 <h4><font face="Arial" color="#2F69A8">Dragonball Z Training</font></h4>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Vegeta's
 Training</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">Not
 a lot is known about Vegeta's training when he was younger, but from
 the Bardock Special it is evident that he went through extensive
 training against saibamen, able to defeat whole groups of them as a
 small child. He also conquered a lot of planets for Frieza, and
 probably got a lot of strength power-ups from taking serious damage. I
 assume that he must have had the same basic training as most of
 Frieza's troops, which is most likely to be his foundation.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>King
 Kai's Training</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">This
 is quite possibly the most influential training of anyone's life. To
 reach King Kai, you must run Snake Way, and that is no easy feat. It
 took Goku about 3/4 of a year to do it, and he was comparatively
 strong at that time! The thing that makes King Kai's training so good
 is not only the obscure methods he uses, but the increased gravity on
 the planet means that the persons strength and speed will be
 increased. At first King Kai taught Goku strength and speed by getting
 him to chase Bubbles, and hit Gregory. Once this was accomplished,
 Goku went on to learn the two most useful attacks in his life:- The
 Kai-o-ken, and the spirit bomb. These were useful allies, and quite
 possibly the best attacks in the whole series. When leaving King
 Kai's, Gregory states that he's even stronger than the master himself,
 which is quite an achievement.&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">King
 Kai has also trained Yamcha, Tien, and Chao-zu, but he only taught
 them the basics of strength and speed, as none of them were capable of
 learning the attacks that Goku did. He attempted to train Piccolo, but
 the Namek decided to train by himself, but was a bit disappointed when
 he saw how fast and strong everyone else had become from King Kai.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Piccolo's
 Wilderness Training</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">After
 Goku's death, Piccolo took Gohan, and decided to utilize his almost
 unlimited potential. At first Piccolo just left him in the wilderness
 to survive on his own, teaching him to show courage, and making him a
 lot faster and stronger. Piccolo slowly formed a bond with the kid,
 feeding him, and watching over him, becoming one of the good-guys. He
 later returned, and personally trained Gohan, giving him a good
 foundation in martial arts. Piccolo's training was tough, harsh, and
 somewhat painful, but Gohan pulled through, and became an excellent
 fighter, only really able to show it during the end of the Saiyan
 saga. It didn't take Gohan long to become stronger than Piccolo,
 achieving it after his spirit and time training with his dad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px">&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Piccolo's
 Self-Training</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">This
 time around, Piccolo was training himself in order to be strong enough
 to combat the Saiyans, who's arrival was imminent. He meditated, and
 increased his power greatly, especially with the use of his mind, able
 to lift entire pyramids without touching them. Gohan was amazed that
 Piccolo was able to achieve such seemingly impossible feats.&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px">&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Kami's
 Training&nbsp;</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">This
 differed greatly to the training he gave in Dragonball, with him
 having a group of the most powerful warriors in the world on his
 lookout this time around, and teaching them very little. He helped
 them increase their power slightly, but compared to Goku, their
 advances were insignificant. The one crucial facto of this training
 was the room of spirit and time, where everyone found out how
 impossibly strong Saiyan are, and that it'd be an extremely tough
 fight to defeat them.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Increased
 Gravity Training</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">Goku
 was the first person to use this, training intensively hard on his way
 to Namek in order to have the power to save his friends. He
 accidentally got a lot powerful by hurting himself, but didn't abuse
 it due to limited sensu beans. During this time he pushed himself way
 past the limit, and discovered how powerful he could become. He got
 the idea of gravity training after he'd been to King Kai, and had such
 an increase in power there. The main thing that improve was his speed.
 He managed to get the dial all the way to 100 times the Earths gravity
 by the end of his trip.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">Vegeta
 also used a capsule pod for his gravity training, trying to become
 strong enough to defeat both Goku and the androids. He got powerful
 enough to reach the entry point to become a Super Saiyan. He managed
 to go all the way to 300 times the Earths normal gravity. Chibi Trunks
 also trained in here, with Vegeta teaching him, and helping him become
 a whole lot more powerful in order to do well in the martial arts
 tournament.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Saiyan
 Ability To Increase Power When Close To Death</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">Whilst
 not essentially a form of training, this was used to make the Saiyans
 a lot stronger. When healed after almost dying, a Saiyan can almost
 double their power. Goku accidentally used this, but Vegeta discovered
 this during the battle against Frieza. He abused this slightly,
 purposely getting hurt in order to become stronger, but it wasn't
 quite enough to defeat Frieza, although it gave him a crucial power
 boost.&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px">&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Yardrat
 Training</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">When
 Namek blew up, Goku managed to escape in a pod, and landed on a planet
 called Yardrat. Here he met some very friendly people, and whilst they
 weren't very strong, they knew lots of useful techniques. It was here
 that Goku learn instantaneous movement, a skill that later proved
 vital in getting him out of some tight situations, and saving the
 Earth too.</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Spirit
 And Time Training</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">This
 was critical in assisting the warrior in terms of power so they could
 defeat Cell. Two people went in at a time - First it was Trunks and
 Vegeta, then it was Gohan and Goku. Whilst the former people went all
 out, and managed to surpass the level of Super Saiyan, Goku and Gohan
 decided to increase their power as Super Saiyan, as ascending makes
 you a lot slower. Everyone got infinitely more powerful, but it was
 Gohan who benefited from it most, with Goku forfeiting a lot of the
 training he could do in order to help his son get stronger.&nbsp;</font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px">&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Future
 Gohan's Training</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">This
 was the base style given to Future Trunks, as Gohan taught him to
 fight in order to beat the androids. This happened in an alternate
 timeline to the one we are familiar with, and it increased Trunks'
 strength massively. When Gohan died, Trunks went past the limit of
 anger, and became Super Saiyan, a feat which would have never been
 accomplished without Gohan's help. Admittedly, Gohan's training was
 completely original, he preferred to train Trunks in a similar way as
 Piccolo trained him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Afterlife
 Training</b></font></p>
 <p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN-TOP: 0px; WORD-SPACING: 0px"><font size="2" face="Arial">After
 sacrificing his life to stop Cell from blowing up the Earth, Goku was
 stuck in the afterlife, but that didn't stop him from training and
 becoming stronger. He fought against many warriors from the past, and
 was trained some more by King Kai. He learnt the skill of fusion, and
 how to become SSJ 3 whilst dead. This contributed greatly to his
 knowledge of fighting, and his technique, as well as hugely increasing
 his strength. His improvements were put to the test when he was wished
 back to fight in the martial arts tournament, with it being
 interrupted, and him going onto fight Majin Vegeta and Buu, his
 strength proving vital to his overall victory.</font></p>
