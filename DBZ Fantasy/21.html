              Tenkaichi Budoukai Review</font></b></font></p>
            <p>In one of Gokuh's preliminary round's he faces Oootako. Oootako 
              is an extremely large man, but Gokuh easily pushes him out of the 
              ring. This stuns a lot of the people as to how such a small kid 
              could defeat such a monster. </p>
            <p>In one of Kuririn's preliminary match's he faces off against Oorinji's 
              Senbai. This is one of the people from where he used to live and 
              this guy always picked on Kuririn. Kuririn easily defeats him in 
              the match, though. </p>
            <p>In the next preliminary round, Gokuh faces off against Bokusa and 
              once again Gokuh defeats his opponent with ease. </p>
            <p>In his next preliminary round, Kuririn faces off against Ken Pou 
              Ka. Ken Pou Ka is a rip off of Bruce Lee in all ways. Despite being 
              a skilled fight, Ken Pou Ka is still defeated by Kuririn. </p>
            <p>In Gokuh's final preliminary match, Gokuh faces off against and 
              he just picks the guy up and throws him out of the ring. </p>
            <p>In Kuririn's final preliminary match, Kuririn fights Bear Man. 
              Bear Man punches Kuririn, but Kuririn dodges the punch and counters 
              with a kick, this causes Bear Man to give up. </p>
            <p>Now, we come to the finals of the Tenkaichi Budoukai which consists 
              of 8 people. The fights will go as follows. Kuririn vs. Bacterium, 
              Jackie Chun vs. Yamucha, Lanfan vs. Namu, and Giran vs. Gokuh. </p>
            <p>The first match consists of Kuririn against Bacterium. Bacterium 
              is a guy who has never bathed and he uses this to his advantage. 
              He has many attacks, one is that he breaths on the opponent, one 
              is that he wipes his crotch area with his hand and makes the opponent 
              smell it, and this next attack is one that almost defeats Kuririn, 
              Bacterium will fart on his opponent. Gokuh reminds Kuririn though, 
              that he does not have a nose and therefore can not even smell it. 
              Kuririn kicks and knocks out Bacterium. </p>
            <p>The next match is Yamucha vs. Jackie Chun. Jackie Chun is actually 
              Kamesennin, but no one knows this. Throughout the whole match it 
              is clearly visible that Yamucha is no match for Jackie Chun and 
              Jackie Chun is quite cocky throughout the match. Yamucha finally 
              uses his Rou Ka Fuu Fuu San attack which is his Wolf Attack. Jackie 
              dodges the attack though and uses an attack that blows Yamucha out 
              of the ring. </p>
            <p>The next match faces Namu up against Lanfan. Namu is fighting in 
              the Tenkaichi Budoukai so that with the prize money he will be able 
              to buy water for his village. Lanfan uses the fact that she is a 
              girl to her advantage though and causes Namu to drop is guard many 
              times and Lanfan is able to get in many attacks. Finally, in a final 
              effort to win, Lanfan removes her close so that she will stun Namu. 
              The attack almost works, but Namu knows that he must win. Namu closes 
              is eyes and knocks out Lanfan. </p>
            <p>The next match let's see Gokuh battle against Giran. Giran and 
              Gokuh exchange many blows, but finally Gokuh is successful and throws 
              Giran out of the ring. Everyone thinks that Goku has one, but we 
              see that Giran can fly and that he never touched the ground. Giran 
              then uses his Guru Guru Gum and traps Gokuh in it. Gokuh is thrown 
              out of the ring, but he is rescued by Kintoun. It is ruled that 
              it will be allowed only this time. Gokuh then breaks free of the 
              Gum and to show his strength he punches a hole in a wall. This causes 
              Giran to give up. </p>
            <p>That is the end of the first round in the finals. Now there are 
              a total of 4 people left in the Tenkaichi Budoukai and they are 
              Jackie Chun vs. Kuririn and Gokuh vs. Namu. </p>
            <p>Jackie Chun and Kuririn will do battle first. Kuririn is losing 
              pretty badly to Jackie, but Kuririn then pulls out a pair of panties 
              in an effort to distract the old man and it works. Kuririn knocks 
              Jackie out of the ring, but Jackie Chun uses a Kame Hame Ha to propel 
              himself back into the ring. After a little more fighting Kuririn 
              is knocked out of the ring by Jackie Chun. </p>
            <p>In the next fight Gokuh will fight Namu. Namu is smart and does 
              not fall for all of Gokuh's tricks easily. Each of the fighters 
              exchange blows for a while, until Namu gets in the first blow. After 
              some more fighting Gokuh uses a spinning attack, but after a while 
              he falls over from being dizzy. After seeing Gokuh on the ground, 
              Namu uses his finishing attack, an attack where he falls at his 
              opponent with his arms in the shape of an &quot;X&quot;. Namu connects 
              with the attack, but Gokuh still manages to get up. After another 
              attempt, Namu is kicked out of the ring. </p>
            <p>We are not ready for the final match which will face Jackie Chun 
              against Gokuh. </p>
            <p>At the beginning of this fight each of the two opponents are trying 
              to out do each other. Gokuh wins the Kame Hame Ha match by a slight 
              margin. Jackie Chun does a double fake image technique and Gokuh 
              then does a triple fake image technique. Jackie Chun then uses his 
              Drunken Style Attack where he wanders around the ring acting drunk. 
              Gokuh knows what Chun is up to, though, and uses his mad dog attack 
              where he just attacks wildly. The fight goes into the night and 
              Gokuh sees the full moon, Gokuh then turns into his Monkey Form. 
              Jackie Chun is forced to blow up the moon. After this, fighting 
              resumes and the two engage in hand to hand combat. The two go to 
              kick each other, but because of his longer legs, Jackie connects 
              more solidly with Gokuh and Gokuh is knocked out. Jackie Chun is 
              then announced the winner of the 21st Tenkaichi Budoukai. </p>
