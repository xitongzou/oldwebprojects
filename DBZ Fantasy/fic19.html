<H3 align=center>The Unloyal Slave<BR>
By Chibi Vegeta</H3>

<P>The timeline for this story is after the fight of Nappa and Vegeta VS
the Z-fighters.

<P>Vegeta is now in his spacepod travelling back to Frieza's
planet to get healed. Meanwhile, the remaining
Z-fighters are being picked up by master Roshi and
Bulma and they are headed for the hospital since
they're aren't any senzu beans for the moment.

<P>Vegeta has now landed and some of Friezas henchmen
are taking Vegeta to the healer. 2 hours later
Vegeta is healed or almost. When he gets out he
decides that he'll take his scouter just to fool
any ennemi that doesn't know he has changed
that much. Frieza is still in the base and goes to
find Vegeta. Frieza: Vegeta! Why did you go to earth
without my permission! Vegeta: I was conquering a
planet for you, Frieza. Frieza: and what do you mean by, Frieza?
Vegeta: so... sorry... Mr.Frieza... Frieza: that's better.

<P>Back on earth. Krillin: Hey Goku! how long do you have to stay in the
hospital?
Goku: At least 1 month cause Korin doesn't have any senzu beans let.
Krillin: I just have to stay a week. Goku: Man you're lucky.
Krillin: I guess so. Gohan: Hi daddy! Goku: Hi Gohan so how long do you
have to stay? Gohan: 8 days and you 1 month hahaha. Goku: You think
that's funny?
Gohan: yes.

<P>While Goku and the others were having fun, Vegeta was already healed and

<P>apparently Frieza had a job for Vegeta. Frieza: By the way Vegeta I have
a job for you.
Shoot! I won't be able to go back to earth Vegeta told himself. Frieza:
You will have
to conquer a planet with an average of 3000 for their power level, some
of
them are quite strong, the strongest has a power level of at least 30
000!
Vegeta: Ok i'll take care of this Mr.Frieza. Frieza: However, you won't
be alone.
Vegeta: What! Frieza: I've decided to send a few peaple along with you
since you've lost
Nappa and Radditz. Vegeta: Who! Frieza: None other than Kwiwi of a power
level of 20 000,
a bit higher than your 18 000, than, Dedoria of a power level of 22 000,
bit higher than kwiwi,
and finaly Zarbon with a power level of 28 000! So, Zarbon is first in
command, Dedoria second and
Kwiwi third. There will also be 5 slugs with you. As Frieza had left
Vegeta told himself: He
doesn't even know my power level is 24 000.

<P>Zarbon: Hurry up Vegeta! Vegeta: Oh shut up! Dedoria: We'll have a
gravitron in our ship, can you
handle 10X gravitration level you weakling! Vegeta: Better than you can!
Kwiwi: hahaha you're so
funny!

<P>Apparently Vegeta doesn't have much friends. Vegeta: Which planet do we
have to conquer? Zarbon:
Patar!
Vegeta: Let's start training. Kwiwi: Let's start with 2X cause Vegeta
will have too much trouble with
3X. Zarbon: You slugs might want to go in another room unless you want
to feel a lot of pain.
Slugs: Ok Zarbon. Zarbon then put 10X gravitration. No one had trouble
with 10X so he put 15X.
Vegeta was laughing at Kwiwi. Kwiwi: How dare you laugh at me I'm
stronger than you! Vegeta: that's
what
you think! Zarbon: Hey Dedoria, do you think it would be a good idea to
make them fight each other?
Dedoria was about to answer but, Vegeta interupted. Vegeta: Of course
that would be a good idea!
Zarbon: What do you say Kwiwi. Kwiwi: Why not! Vegeta: put 20X! Kwiwi:
Are you crazy! 20X! you
didn't
even try moving at 15X, I bet that was cause you couldn't even move!
Vegeta: just put 20X and shut up
Kwiwi: I guess it's worth it you won't even be able to move! Zarbon: Ok,
it's at 20X and remember
Kwiwi
don't kill him cause we still need him. Kwiwi: No problem I just want to
teach him some respect!
Vegeta: Why don't you stop talking and start fighting! Kwiwi: Ok, one
little ki blast and you're done!
So Kwiwi powers up a bit while Vegeta does nothing and Kwiwi shoots a
little ki blast. Vegeta: That
was weak! and don't even try a ki again you'll blow up the ship, why
don't you attack head on! So
Kwiwi
wants to attck him but, doesn't move. Vegeta: what's wrong. Zarbon: What
do you think you're doing
Kwiwi!
Kwiwi: I can't move! Vegeta just walks up to Kwiwi gives him one
powerful punch on the face and
Kwiwi is
out cold. Zarbon: Incredible! Dedoria: He can move in 20X! Vegeta: why
don't you go and train the slugs
Kwiwi? Kwiwi then left.

<P>6 days later they had all gotten used to 30X, even Kwiwi, and they have
landed on Patar. Zarbon: Ok,
we have to divide our men in 3 groups so Kwiwi and Vegeta are together,
Dedoria, your with 4 hencmen
and I
am with one henchmen. Dedoria you stay at the ship, I'll go attack the
village to the south and Kwiwi and
Vegeta
you attack the village to the east and if you see anybody close Dedoria
you can kill them. So let's go! Oh
and I
almost forgot Kwiwi you're in charge and Dedoria you're in charge. If
anybodyfinds the 30 000 power
level guy
tell me straight away. So Kwiwi and Vegeta went in the direction of the
east village. Kwiwi: Now Vegeta
stay out
of my way while I take care of the village. Vegeta: you get outta my
way! and Vegeta shot his scouter.
Kwiwi: Why
did you do that! Well I guess I'll just have to take your scouter when
we're finished with this village.
Vegeta: So,
will you get out of my way! Kwiwi: You won't even be able to take that
village out. Vegeta prepared a
huge
final flash and started walking around in the village saying: join us or
you will all die. 15 minutes later all
the
village was assembled and a man called Firnham asked Vegeta what he
wanted. Vegeta: I am one of
Frieza's
hencmen and I was sent to conquer your planet so you have 2 choices 1,
die and 2 join us. Firnham:
Frie... Frie... Frie...
Frieza! Vegeta: Yes Frieza so, do you join or die? Firnham:... All of a
sudden a Patarien with a power
level of 5000 attacked
Vegeta. Vegeta dodged all the attacks easily and said: you want to die?
and throws his final flash causing
15 other Patariens to
die too. Vegeta: So for the rest of you do you want to join or die?
Firnham: I guess we have no choice...
Kwiwi: What are you
trying to do Vegeta make an army? Vegeta:You shut up! Firnham: What do
you want us to do? Vegeta:
Just follow me. Vegeta and
Kwiwi went back to the ship to find out their next mission. Zarbon: What
took so long? Kwiwi: Vegeta
wanted to make an army.
Zarbon: How many have you captured? Vegeta: 20. Zarbon: Good so now we
have captured 30 peaple.
By the way how did you lose you're
scouter Kwiwi? Kwiwi: Vegeta destroyed it. Vegeta: He was in the way!
Zarbon: Anyway, next, I think
we should attack
the strongest Patarien. Zarbon: What's his name? Vegeta: Firnham.
Zarbon: So Firnham, do you know
where you're strongest
warrior is located? Firnham: Yes, he's located at the far north. Zarbon:
Kwiwi will stay with the 5 slugs
and the Patariens
while we attack the strongest Patarien. Let's go!

<P>10 days has passed and Gohan and Krillin are now completely healed as
for Goku... Gohan: Feeling any
better dad? Goku: A bit but,
I still have to stay in here for 3 weeks. Krillin: Well I'm just happy
that Vegeta is gone. Goku: He may be
gone for the moment but,
I have a feeling that he'll be coming back soon. Krillin: Uh oh, so do
you have an idea? Goku: Well if I
was at 100% I would be
training. Gohan: Yeah let's train and become stronger than picolo.
Krillin: How long are you planning to
train Gohan? Gohan: I don't know.
Goku: I have a great idea for your training, you could go to king kais.
Krillin: How far is that? Goku: Real
far, I guess it isn't that
great a idea after all. Krillin: Then I guess we'll just have to train
the old fashion way. Gohan: We could
train with weights.
Krillin: Yeah great idea, we'll put on a lot of weights, go up to
Korin's tower to get some senzus, come
back to you give you 1
and fight between each other and use the senzus! Gohan: Yeah! Goku:
Hurry up I want to get outta here!

<P>Zarbon: There is a power level of 15 000 over there. Dedoria: I have one
of 25 000! Vegeta: Once he
powers up he'll probably be
at 30 000! Zarbon: Lead the way Dedoria! 10 minutes later, Dedoria: It's
there we can land soon. Zarbon: Let me take care of
getting him out. Zarbon entered a house and asked for the strongest
warrior. Patarien: He's in the other
house. Zarbon: Thank you
and you may want to tell the other Patariens to come out if, they want
to see a fight. Patarien: ok...
Zarbon then entered the closest
house and demanded the Patarien warrior to come out. Zarbon: What are
you waiting for come! Dedoria
and Vegeta were waiting impatiently
to start fighting. Sagar: My name name is Sagar and this is a peaceful
planet so, what are you doing here?
Zarbon: We were sent here by Frieza to... Sagar:What! Frieza!!! Zarbon:
Yes! Frieza! As I was saying
we were sent here to conquer this planet.
Sagar: I see and what do I have to do with this?
Dedoria: Since you're the strongest we want to fight you and see if we
will be able to take care of the rest
of those Patariens.

<P>Sagar decided to power up... Zarbon: 25 000, 26 000, 27 000,28 000! He's
passed my power level!
Dedoria: But, you've trained Zarbon, you must be at least a bit higher
than you were before.
Zarbon: Maybe you're right, take my reading. 29 000, 30 000! Dedoria:
You're at 29 000!
Zarbon: No he's at 30 000 and it's still going up! 31 000! I have no
choice! Zarbon then transformed himself and had a power level of...
Dedoria: You're now at 32 000, 33 000 and 35 000!
Zarbon: That's better, I'm at my max now and he's only at... oh no! 34
000, 35 000, 36 000 37 000, it's still going up, 38 000, 39 000 and I
think it's finished now, 40 000! Sagar: So you're not strong enough?
Zarbon: Why you! Vegeta take a reading of Dedoria and Dedoria you can
take a reading of Vegeta.
Dedoria went to his max while Vegeta went up to 21 000, not nearly his
max, but, he doesn't want them to know he's this strong like that he
could attack Kwiwi and kill him and say that there was a real strong
Patarien that killed him, but what is his max?

<P>Vegeta: Dedoria, you're at 24 000. Dedoria: and you're at 21 000.
Zarbon: Well, I guess you can help out a bit...
Sagar: So who's attacking? Zarbon whispered to Vegeta and Dedoria: Power
up your strongest ki, combine it and shoot it when I'm in trouble or
whenever you think it will help the most.
Then Zarbon said loudly: I guess I'll go first then! Vegeta started a
Gallet gun while Dedoria started a ki of is own. Sagar shoots a blast at
Zarbon that caught him even though he tried his best to dodge it.
Sagar: If that hurted well wait for this... Sagar shouted: Sagar beam! A
huge beam appeared and was slow but, huge Zarbon wasn't sure what to do
he said: Shoot! So, Vegeta and Dedoria shot there huge blast but, the
Sagar beam was still too powerful. Zarbon: Put all you're energy to push
it back and Zarbon went in between Vegeta and Dedoria and prepared a
blast and combined it with the two other beams.
The two beams were now equal. Sagar: Patariens help me! All of a sudden
10 Patariens went behind Sagar and each shot a less powerful Sagar beam
and they all combined which was pushing the trio's beam while 10 other
Patariens went behind the trio and all shot Sagar beams causing a huge
explosion!

<P>When Vegeta woke up he found himself in a Patarien jail with Kwiwi
beside him.
Vegeta: What are you doing here! Kwiwi: When I saw that huge explosion
and I saw on my scouter 3 powers fading I came and they brought me here
with you 3. Vegeta: Were are they anyway? Kwiwi: There in another cell.
Vegeta: Why didn't you destroy the stupid cell? Kwiwi: I tried, it's too
powerful!
Vegeta: To pass time why don't we fight! Kwiwi: I can finaly destroy you
without Zarbon knowing!
Vegeta started to power up but Kwiwi was already powered up and started
punching and kicking Vegeta. Vegeta wasn't able to block any punch or
kick and then Kwiwi shot his most powerful blast which Vegeta was
luckily able to block, while the smoke was clearing Vegeta was powering
up and Kwiwi saw on his scouter 30 000! Kwiwi: But that can't be! You
were at 18 000 the last time I saw you! Vegeta: Bye! Vegeta then shot a
weak blast (weak for him) and killed Kwiwi living hapily ever after in
his cell alone!

<P>But, he won't stay forever, now that the intro is finished and that
everybody knows the beginning the action shall begin! I will write the
next book if this is appreciated enough.
