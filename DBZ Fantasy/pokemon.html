        Hello and welcome to The SuperLuigi Pokémon Crystal Japanese Guide. I'm SuperLuigi,
formerly Donphan and I'll do my best to guide you through Pokémon Crystal! Enjoy!

	In this edition I fixed minor errors throughout the guide and changed a few names.

 4. Changes From Gold/Silver
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

	Pokémon Crystal is pretty much (like this guide) an edited version of Pokémon Gold/
Silver. It contains the same Pokémon, but it has a few changes from Gold/Silver, the most
noticible (If You Live in Japan) is the online play mode, where you can hook your game up
to the cellular phone and play with other trainers over the internet. It's a lot for a
little game, but it's a wonderful addition, and the first step towards online gaming.

	Also, you may have noticed you can catch Suicuine right off of the map, removing of
those long hour searches you did to find it in the other games. This doesn't apply to Entei
or Raikou, but it's a time saver.

	One of the most exciting changes is the fact that you can now catch Celebi right in
the game, rather then looking for a darned Promotional tournament, and finding you can't
get it there anyway..

	There are other changes, and you'll see them as you play throughout the game, such
as the route changing feature. While some are useful, some are also just used to make the
game nicer and a bit easier.

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 5. Controls
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

	The controls, like in all other Pokémon games, are very simple, and require no
knowledge to learn, which is why the game appeals to many young gamers all over the world.
I have devised a list of the controls and their functions below.

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 5. Walkthrough For Routes 1-46
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

      You are about to embark on a long journey. When the game begins, you will notice
that Professor Oak has overslept! He needs you to set the time for the game. Program in
the correct time, and you will get Professor Oak's lecture.

      Professor Oak's comment will explain the world of Pokémon. If you played other
versions of Pokémon, you'll know what he's talking about.

      You will begin your journey in New Bark Town. you will be in your bedroom inside of
your house. When you leave your room to go downstairs, you will be interupted by your
mother. She will ask you what day of the week it is, and you will get your PokéGear. If
you are not falmilliar with the PokéGear, you can have your mother explain it to you.
Now you can go get your first Pokémon.

	Leave your house, and head left. You'll notice a large building. This is Professor
Elm's labratory. He will greet you, and ask you for a favor. He'll give you a Pokémon.
Afterwards, outside, you'll notice someone spying in the window. Who could this be? You'll
find out very soon.

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 5.01 Who should you choose?
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*


	Chikorita
		The grass type Pokémon. Only advanced players should choose Chikorita,
for it is the hardest route to take when you are in jouhto, but it great for the second
half of the game.

	Totodile
		The water type Pokémon and my favorite of the three. You will not encounter
any hard trouble throughout the game with Totodile, because it has no real disadvantage at
any gym.

	Cyndaquil
		The fire type Pokémon, and your best bet of the three. Jouhto will be easy,
but the second half of the game won't. He is the most popular Pokémon of all of them.

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

        After recieving your 'partner' Elm will then give you his number and tell you to
call him if you ever need his assistance.

	Continue along Route 29, collecting the items, and talking to the people. You may
notice a building that leads north. This building does not serve a purpose in this part of
the game. It will, however, be used later.

	Make your way to the next town, Cherrygrove City. At the entrance of the town, you
will notice an old man standing there. He has been a Pokémon Trainer for a long time, so
he knows a lot about the world. Take his tour of Cherrygrove, and he will give you the
map, which will be accessible through your PokéGear.

	Heal your Pokémon, and head north out of town. Continue going north, until you
reach a fork in a road. Inside this house, you will find a man that will trade you an Onix.
Take the right fork, and you will eventually come across a building. Inside, Professor Oak
will give you a Pokédex, and an egg, which was to be studied at Professor Elm's lab.

        Once you get outside, you will recieve a Phone Call on your Cell Phone informing
you that a Pokémon has been stolen! He needs you to come to his lab immedeatly. As you
reach the exit of Cherrygrove, you will bump into a person. This is the person who was
lookig in Prof. Elm's lab earlier, and above all, the Pokémon Theif.

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 5.02 Who did your Rival Choose?
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

	This can vary. If you chose Chikorita, he will have Cyndaquil. This is because fire
is super-effective against grass.

	If you chose Totodile in the beginning, he will counter it with a Chikorita,
because grass has an advantage against water.

	Finally, if in the beginning of the game, you chose Cyndaquil, the fire type, he
will have stolen Totodile, because his water Pokémon has an advantage against your fire
type Pokémon.

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*


	After you defeat your rival (or lose), return to Professor Elm's lab. He will be
there with a police officer, and will ask you what the boy's name was. You will then be
prompted to name your rival. Afterwards, the police officer will leave, and Professor Elm
will examine the egg. His lab aid will give you 5 PokéBalls for your effort on your way
out.

	Take Cherrygrove city north, fighting trainers along the way until you come
across the fork in the road. Take the left fork, and keep going north, until you come
across a new town. Welcome to Cherrygrove City.

	First, go all the way north in the town. You will come up to a very tall
building. This is the Sprout Tower. This is the building where you'll be getting Flash! Go
inside, fighting trainers. Eventually, you will reach the top of the tower. You will get a
chance to see your Rival fighting the Leader there. He will lose, and leave the building,
not challenging you to a match. You can now fight the leader of Sprout Tower.

	After defeating Sprout tower, it is time to go to the Gym Leader, Falkner!

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 5.03 Faulkner and The Zephyr Badge!
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 Gym leader: Falkner
 For: Zephyr Badge
 Prizes: $900 and TM31

 Pidgey- If you picked Cyndaquil, he will work well against Pidgey. Totodile will also
fare well. However, Chikorita is weak against flying type Pokémon, but if it was trained
fairly, it should do well.

 Pidgeotto- You may find Pidgeotto a little more difficult than Pidgey, but it shouldn't
be too much of a problem for you as long as you have a well balanced team. Use Sentret if
you can. Depending on your version, you can have either Ledyba or Spiniarak.

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

	Congradulations, you have achieved your first badge, and by now, you should at
least have your starting Pokémon evolved.

	After exiting the gym, you receive a phone call from Prof. Oak. He tells you to
pick up something important at the Pokémon Center. When you get to the Pokémon center,
you will see one of Elm's aids. He will give you a Pokémon egg. The egg will hatch at
about 2,000-3,000 steps.

	Now proceed west of Voilet City. There is a tree-like Pokémon blocking your path!
Oh well, you can still go south. Once you enter the building, you'll be in the Ruins of
Aplh.

	There are many things you will be able to do here later, but if you'd like, you
can (It's Not Manditory) solve the Kabuto Puzzle, which will open a floor below you, and
will allow you to catch a variety of Unowns. Unown has 26 different shapes- one for each
letter of the alphabet! Try to collect them all later.

	Follow the checkpoint that heads east to Route 32. Fight trainers along the way
down. A man standing near the Pokémon Center will try to collect 1,000,000 Dollars from
you but will not be able to do it, because you don't have enough. He will mumble
something about kids today being loaded with money and will leave you alone.

	SPECIAL: On Fridays, a girl will be just north of the Pokémon Center. Her name
is Frieda and she will give you 'Poision Barb,' an item that raises the Pokémon
eqqiped with it's Poision Attacks.

	Enter the cave, and fight the trainers inside along the way. There aren't many,
but fight them anyway to strengthen your team now, because it will pay off big time
later.There really isn't much you can do in this cave now, but come back when you have
surf to fully explore it.

	SPECIAL: On Fridays, in Union Cave, after you have Surf, you can catch a Lapras.
Lapras will appear even after you have caught it so you may catch as many as you'd like!

        After exiting the cave, you will find yourself on Route 33. Fight HIKER ANTHONY
and get his Phone Number. He will supply you with information on some rare Pokémon
later in your journey.

        When you get to Azalea Town, you will notice a strange man blocking the
entrance to Slowpoke Well. Talk to Kurt, and he'll scare off the person, who you find
out is a part of the New Team Rocket that has reformed after being expelled from the
world 3 years ago. When you go down into Slowpoke Well, you will find Kurt injured
and unable to move, You will have to remove of the remaining Team Rocket Members on
your own.

	Defeat the Team Rocket Members, and return to Kirts house. He will award you
with a LURE BALL, a ball which gives you a higher chance of catching Pokémon you
encounter while using a ROD to fish.

	Now, you are able to go to The Azela Town Gym, where you will fight Bug-Type
Pokémon.

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 5.04 Bugsy and the Hive Badge
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 Gym Leader: Bugsy
 For: Hive Badge
 Prizes: TM49, Pokémon up to Level 30 Obey

 Metapod - Lv.14 - An extremely easy Pokémon to beat. You may want to use one of your
weaker Pokémon against Metapod to gain some easy levels.

 Kakuna - Lv. 14 - Another easy Pokémon to beat. Once again, you should be working on
leveling up your weaker Pokémon for experience Points.

 Scyther - Lv. 16 - You've fought your easy Pokémon, and now it's time for a small
challenge. If you chose Cyndaquil, Scyther will be VERY easy. Any other type of Pokémon
strong against Bug-Types will fare well, too.

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

	After you defeat the gym leader, immedeatly go to the Pokémon Center and save your
game. It's time to fight your Rival Again.

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 5.05 Rival Battle #2
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
For: [Nothing]

 Gastly - Lv 12 - Gastly will be easy if you have a normal Pokémon with an attack that
isn't normal type. Gastly is unable to attack normal type Pokémon, and Normal type Pokémon
are unable to attack Gastly.

 Zubat - Lv. 14 - Zubat shouldn't be difficult at all either. Any Pokémon will fare well
against it. The only attack to look out for is Leech Life, which drains HP from you
Pokémon and gives some of it to Zubat.

	AND

 Croconaw - Lv 16 - If your Rival has Croconaw, it'll have Watergun. That is the only
attack to watch out for. If you have Cyndaquil, don't use it here. Use a grass type
Pokémon if avalible.

	OR

Bayleef - Lv. 16 - If your Rival Has a Bayleef, watch out for it's Razor Leaf attack! It
has a great chance of getting a critical hit, which Can be very painful, considering
critical attacks do 1.5 times the damage.

	OR

Quiliva - Lv. 16 - Nothing much to worry about here. Quiliva shouldn't be problem at all
for you.

        Now go north, and into a house that will lead you into
the forest. You see that a boy has lost his Farfetch'd, after
returning it to him, his father will come along and give you
the HM01, Cut.

        Cut the shrub, and continue going north. You will
eventually reach a town much similar to Celadon City. It will
have a large shop, and it will be the largest town in the game.
This town is also a very important town.

        The gym here will use normal type Pokémon. Watch out,
her Mirutanku is extremely powerful.
-------------------------------------------------
| Gym Leader: Akane                             |
| For: Normal Badge                             |
|                                               |
| Clefairy- Looks can be decieving, and you'd   |
| better pray that Clefairy doesn't use         |
| Metronome on you. Have a quick and Powerful   |
| Pokémon like Rattatta or Raticate.            |
|                                               |
| Mirutanku- Mirutanku has a strange attack that|
| makes your Pokémon get woozy. Your Pokémon    |
| not attack the Mirutanku for a few turns, but |
| while waiting to attack, Mirutanku will attack|
| you with a powerful pound-like attack. Once   |
| again, have a powerful and quick Pokémon      |
-------------------------------------------------

        When you are done, talk to the gym leader to receive
your badge and TM. Go north, and into the park to fight many
trainers, believe me, you need the expirence. Go to the most
upper  righthand house in the town, and a lady will give you
something  called 'Squirtle Water'. Now you can fight the
tree Pokémon, Usokki, that you could only move slightly
before. Catch this Pokémon, for it is rare. Go northwest, to
reach the next town. In this town, a man will trade you a
Krabby for a Shelder.

	A trainer just east of where Usokki used to be will
give you the TM08 (Rock Smash) ability. This will allow you
to break the rocks and free the Legendary Cats.

	Before you go, you can also go upstairs in the shop and
purchase a TM02, which will allow you to shake trees. You can
fight all sorts of old and new Pokémon in the trees, so shake
all the little trees you find.

        The gym here in this town will specialize in ghost Pokémon. Your
Pokémon should be at around level 30-35. You will have to follow a trail
to get to the gym leader. Once you get to the Gym leader, and believe me,
she's no joke:
------------------------------------------------
| Gym Leader: Matsuba                           |
| For: Phantom Badge                            |
|                                               |
| Gastly- Her easiest Pokémon she will use, but |
| still isn't too easy. Try using a water or    |
| fire attack, but don't waste your time using a|
| normal type- it won't work against ghost.     |
|                                               |
| Haunter-  Both Haunters and Gengar will use an|
| extrelemy powerful attack that will hurt them |
| about half way, but curses you and hurts you  |
| very much every time you attack.              |
|                                               |
| Gengar- Gengar isn't easy at all- infact it is|
| one of the toughest battles you will face in  |
| the entire game. Look out for that powerful   |
| attack that Haunter, it is exactly the same   |
| only coming from a much stronger Pokémon.     |
|                                               |
| Haunter- Use the same strategy that you used  |
| against the previous Haunter.                 |
------------------------------------------------


        After defeating the gym, go to a house in the northern part of the
town. The trainers here will use Eevee evolutions, which includes two new
Eevee evolutions. After you defeat them all, a man will award you with the
surfing HM03.

        A farm which has Mirutaknus, I'm guessing it would be called
Mirutanku farm will have a sick Mirutanku. The plant which gives you items
next to the town will give you a fruit that will heal the Mirutanku after
about after 7 or so. The mother inside the house will award you with a TM,
and the dad in the house gives you milk, which heals Pokémon HP.

        When you get to the next town, you'll find the gym here to be
completely empty, except for the person who alwasy stands next to the
statue at the entrance.

        You might want to heal your Pokémon at the Pokémon center now, and
take out a Pokémon you would like to learn strength. Now, go to the house
in the most southwestern part of the town. A person inside will give you the
Strength HM, HM04.

        Now you have to equip strength and surf on your Pokémon. Keep surfing
south, fighting the trainers here, gaining expirence.

        Eventually, you will come to a small town. In the southern part of
the town, you will see the gym. You fight two trainers in the gym, and then
come up to a boulder maze. Move the left and right boulder up, and then push
the middle boulder to the left. You will fight one more trainer, and then you
will come up to the gym leader.
-------------------------------------------------
| Gym Leader: Shijima                           |
| For: Shock Badge                              |
|                                               |
| Primeape- A bird Pokémon would be a good bet, |
| but my Raticate had no problem and Primeape is|
| strong against it.                            |
|                                               |
| Poliwrath- Fly may be a good use for Poliwrath|
| because it is not very fast, a Yorunozuku can |
| easily knock out this Pokémon                 |
-------------------------------------------------

        After you beat the gym, go south to a house. A guy inside the house,
wearing sunglasses will give you some medicine. Take this medicine and go
back to the fifth gym, but don't forget to get the Fly HM, HM02, from the
house nearest the gym, and also important is the medicine from the house with
the guy who will be wearing sunglasses, for the medicine he gives to you is
what you need to give to Mikan, so she can heal her sick Pokémon.Assend the
light house, and give the medicine to the gym leader at the top. She will
give the medicine to her sick Pokémon and then return to her gym. She
introduces a new type of Pokémon here called the steel type.
-------------------------------------------------
| Gym Leader: Mikan                             |
| For: Steel Badge                              |
|                                               |
| Magnemite- Looks easy, but it's sonic boom    |
| attack is very powerful, even against Pokémon |
| that are strong against it. Use a Geodude or  |
| Graveler to prevent serious damage.           |
|                                               |
| Magnemite- Use the same strategy as you did   |
| with the last Magnemite.                      |
|                                               |
| Haganail- Another stong Pokémon that likes to |
| use Powerful attacks. Make sure you have a    |
| rock, ground or fast Pokémon if you want to   |
| win the match.                                |
-------------------------------------------------

        After defeating the gym leader here, go east, and through the route
change house. Someone takes some of your money for no reason at all! Now go
north, taking the grassy path, as not to be charged 1,000 for every path you
take on the Team Rocket side. Eventually, you will come up across a lake. You
can see something in the lake. When you fight it, it turns out to be a
Gyrados! Try to catch it.

        After getting out of the water, you will notice Lance, the dragon
trainer waiting for you. You will talk to him, and he will take you to the
'shop' in the town with the ghost gym. He will show you a secret underground
passageway in the shop, and you will follow him downstairs, only to fight a
many Rocket trainers. Eventually, you will meet up with Lance again, and he
will heal your Pokémon. He will then go off again, and you have to keep
fighting many Rocket trainers. There are many items here, and make sure you
have room for all of them. Also, talk to each and every Team Rocket trainer
you beat, and you will get the keycard to the second level door.

        Once on the second level, open the door, and fight the trainer. He
will give you the first level keycard. Go to the first level. Lance and you
fight each fight two Rocket trainers. A girl and a boy. Lance takes on the
boy with his Dragonite, and You fight the girl, who may look falmilliar to
you.

        After defeating the Rocket Trainers, you and Lance need to shut down
the power supply to the generator. You can do this by defeating the
Electrodes.

        Finally, now that you've destroyed the generator, Lance will award
your hard work with an, HM06, the whirlpool remover HM.
        You can now enter the Ice gym, or gym No. 7. Getting to him will be
tough, so I made an ice maze strategy. When you first enter the gym, move to
the very left if the left statue. Go up, up, right, down, left, up and
finally right. You will be standing in front of the gym leader. Good luck!

-------------------------------------------------
| Gym Leader: Yanagi                            |
| For: Ice Badge                                |
|                                               |
| Seel- An electric attack will put seel out for|
| the match. Not very strong.                   |
|                                               |
| Dewgong- Just slightly better than Seel. It   |
| might even get an attack on you. (oh no!)     |
|                                               |
| Inomu- A powerful, but slow Pokémon, Inomu    |
| rely on ice moves to win the match. Use an    |
| water Pokémon like Marril.                    |
-------------------------------------------------

        You will get a phone call informing you that the city in which you
recieved your third badge, the one with Mirtanku, the cow Pokémon, has been
overrun by Team Rocket! Fly to the city, and you will see that Team Rocket
has pretty much overrun the whole city. Go back to the building with the
Jigglypuff inside of it. This is where all of the Team Rocket trouble is
going on. Go on up the tower, defeating trainers, and defeat the final guy
at the top of the tower.

        One of the people in the underground tunnel will give you an Eevee
if you have a space in your inventory.

        Now you have to go to an underground tunnel outside. When you are in
the tunnel, go right, to the door that was once locked. You recieved the key
when you defeated the final person atop the tower. Be ready for a fight with
your rival. He will have the final evolution of his starting Pokémon. Defeat
the Rocket trainers, and play around with the switches until you get over to
the elevator. Fight the woman, and then take the elevator up. You should now
be able to open the once locked door back in the Team Rocket tower.

        Go to the third floor, and defeat the last of the Rockets, and return
to the seventh town. Go right and fight the trainers. Marril lovers can catch
a Marril here. Now enter the cave. The first Ice maze is the most diffucult,
but, I have the solution on how to complete it! Complete it by standing on
the area right below the ice. Now, go up, left, up, right, up, right, down,
left, up, left, down, right, down, right, up, right.

        When you complete the first ice maze, go right and get the PokTball.
You will get a HM07, or waterfall climbing HM, which can later be taught to
Goldeen. From here go to the next floor, and use strength to move the
boulders to the lower level, so you can get out.

        When you get out, you will be at the 8th town. There is a very useful
person here who can remove your Pokémon's moves that are unwanted, but most
importantly, you can now go to the eighth gym. This gym is a dragon gym.

        Again, you will need strength to move boulders to the lower level to
reach the gym leader.
-------------------------------------------------
| Gym Leader: Ibuki                             |
| For: Raging Badge                             |
|                                               |
| Dragonair- A pretty intiminating Pokémon, that|
| turns out to not be too much of a challenge at|
| all. If you move ahead first, and catch Inomu |
| from the Ice Cave, you can use ice moves to   |
| defeat it.                                    |
|                                               |
| Dragonair- Use the same strategy as you used  |
| on the last Dragonair                         |
|                                               |
| Kingudora- Seadra finally gets used by a      |
| dragon trainer- well at least it's evolved    |
| form. Again, use ice attacks, but electric    |
| will work too, since this is also a water     |
| Pokémon.                                      |
|                                               |
| Dragonair- Her final, Pokémon Dragonair, is a |
| bit more powerful than the previous ones. It  |
| will use the Hyper Beam attack, as well as    |
| Dragon Rage. Thunder won't work this time, so |
| once again, you must rely on Ice Pokémon to   |
| defeat Dragonair.                             |
-------------------------------------------------

        After defeating her, she tells you she has no badge for you. You can
still get the badge, though, by taking a Pokémon that has surf and one that
can remove whirlpools, and surfing behind the gym. When you are  about to
pick up one of the Pokéballs, she will show up, awarding you with your eighth
badge! You can also now use the HM07 you got in the ice cavern.

        We now move on to the hunt for Houou! Fly back to the town where you
fought the ghost gym before. Go to the northern part of the town. You can
enter a house here and go upstairs. You will have to solve a puzzle to get to
the top. However, the puzzle is worth it, when you get to the top, you will
see Houou flying there. Save before you fight Houou, for you will only get
one chance to catch it. After you catch it, you can fly from the roof instead
of going back down the maze. Fly back to your hometown.

        Once home, go to Prof. Utsugi's lab and heal your Pokémon. Now go
outside and surf eastward. You will eventually come up to a coastal area with
a cave. Enter the cave. I suggest you catch a Goldeen and teach it HM07, so
you can go up the waterfalls. The cave is simple, and when you get out, you
may want to look at the map. Keep moving northward, until you come up upon a
house. A girl inside will heal all of your Pokémon. Keep going north,
fighting trainers. You will find yourself in a much simpler, trainer-free
Victory Road. Here you can catch for the very first time, the best Pokémon,
Donphan. Be prepared, for your rival will have many strong Pokémon with her.
You fight her because she wants to see if you are really ready for the
Orange league.

The Orange League Trainers will use:
-------------------------------------------------
| Trainer 1: Itkusi                             |
|                                               |
| Neiteio- A penguin Pokémon. It will use ice   |
| and psychic attacks- a powerful combination.  |
| Houou's gust attack is enough to put the      |
| penguin to rest                               |
|                                               |
| Slowbro- A water and Psychic Pokémon. Slowbro |
| may be very slow, but he is very powerful. Try|
| using an electric type Pokémon against it.    |
|                                               |
| Neiteio- Use the same strategy that you used  |
| against the last Neiteio.                     |
|                                               |
| Jynx- Like Neiteio, Jynx is another psychic   |
| and ice Pokémon. It's defense is extremely low|
| so any Pokémon should be able to put Jynx out.|
|                                               |
| Exeggutor- A grass and Psychic type Pokémon.  |
| One Fire Blast from Houou should do the trick |
| on this one.                                  |
|                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------|
| Trainer 2: Koga                               |
|                                               |
| Araidosu- A bug Pokémon. Hopefully, your Houou|
| is still consious, because any flying or fire |
| attacks will put this bug out.                |
|                                               |
| Venomoth- Another bug Pokémon that will be a  |
| pain if your Houou has fainted. It will use   |
| powerful psychic attacks, and almost every    |
| Pokémon are very vunerable to.                |
|                                               |
| Muk- A poision Pokémon that Houou will not be |
| strong against. Use a water type or a normal  |
| type. (Raticate will do)                      |
|                                               |
| Kuroba- Being the evolved form of Golbat, it  |
| has strong flying and annoying poision        |
| attacks.                                      |
|                                               |
| Fuoretosu- Is this the evolved form of        |
| Cloyster? Maybe, but it's a water type, and it|
| has very high defense, and Houou may not be   |
| able to do it. Use your starting Pokémon if   |
| you didn't pick the Fire type.                |
|                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------|
| Trainer 3: Bruno                              |
|                                               |
| Kaporea- For some odd reason, this Pokémon    |
| likes to stand on his head. A bird type, Houou|
| or Lugia will do.                             |
|                                               |
| Hitmonchan- The punching fiend. It will use   |
| various elemental punches, so there really    |
| a Pokémon that it isn't super effective       |
| against. Use a bird type again.               |
|                                               |
| Hitmonlee- The kicking fiend. It uses various |
| kicking attacks. Go ahead, use another bird.  |
| This might be a good Pokémon to get a         |
| Togechikku expirence points with.             |
|                                               |
| Machamp- A Pokémon with high attack Power, but|
| low defense. A quick bird Pokémon should do   |
| the trick.                                    |
|                                               |
| Onix- Onix is a simple Pokémon that is not too|
| hard if you have a water or grass Pokémon.    |
| Even using the simplest moves of these types  |
| will take care of it.                         |
| ----------------------------------------------|
| Trainer 4: Karin                              |
|                                               |
| Burakki- Appears to be an evil evolution of   |
| Eevee. It shouldn't be too hard if you have   |
| just about any type besides a normal or grass |
| type Pokémon.                                 |
|                                               |
| Vileplume- A grass type Pokémon that will be  |
| easy for any bird type. Using fly would be    |
| your best bet against this Pokémon.           |
|                                               |
| Gengar- Remember the ghost gyms Gengar? This  |
| is the same thing, only much harder. Again, it|
| has curse, which will stab itself, and attack |
| you very much after or before every turn. Be  |
| careful and make sure you have a strong and   |
| quick Pokémon.                                |
|                                               |
| Yamikarasu- A very fast, but not too strong   |
| Pokémon that looks much like a Spearow. It    |
| take adventage of it's quickness and try to   |
| hurt you before you can hurt it. A fire,      |
| electric, or ice type will do.                |
|                                               |
| Heruga- A fire type dog Pokémon of the evil   |
| type. It has many strong attacks, so make sure|
| you have a water Pokémon handy.               |
|                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------|
| Final Trainer: Lance                          |
|                                               |
| Gyrados- A Dragon and flying type Pokémon,    |
| gyrados is extremely weak to  electric type   |
| attacks. If not, any slash or bite attack will|
| take longer, but it will have to do.          |
|                                               |
| Dragonite- An extremely strong Pokémon, and it|
| doesn't make you feel any better to know that |
| he has three of them. Use an ice attack, or   |
| again, a slash.                               |
|                                               |
| Dragonite- Use the same strategy as you used  |
| the previous dragonite.                       |
|                                               |
| Dragonite- Again, use the same strategy you   |
| on the previous two Dragonites.               |
|                                               |
| Aerodactyl- A very powerful Pokémon, again    |
| with the hyperbeam attack. Use a water,       |
| electric, or ice attack to defeat this flying |
| rock.                                         |
|                                               |
| Charizard- Lance's Charizard will have a Hyper|
| beam attack, as well as fire attacks. Be quick|
| because this Pokémon is very powerful.        |
------------------------------------------------|

        After defeating the Orange League Trainers, you've beaten the first
half of the game. A very impatient news reporter comes, and expects you to
"do" an interview with you. Finally, Lance will become impatient and take
you into the next room to be inducted into the hall of fame while the news
reporter lady paces back and fourth saying "What about my interview!" The
credits will roll, while playing some snappy music, and finally the game will
say the end. Don't turn your Gameboy off yet, the game isn't over.

        There is no more fighting your rival at the end of the game....well
at least yet. The game isn't over yet!

        After the credits finish rolling, go into Prof. Utsugi's lab. He will
give you a boat ticket! Take that ticket back to the town with the light
house and where you got strength. Go south, until you reach a house that
takes you down to a docking bay. Here you can get on the boat. Once on the
boat, you will fight many trainers. Fight them all, it is fun. Afterwards,
you will talk to a guy in a room that looks like he works on the ship. Talk
to him, and he will leave the room. When you get off the boat, you will find
yourself in Vermillion City!

        Feel free to look around a little bit. You see the gym looks pretty
much the same and the Pokémon club is also still there. However, this time,
the city has a giant snorlax blocking the path to Diglett's Cave. First, heal
your Pokémon. Now, go get the Ultra Rod from the fishing man. Now it is time
to go and face Lt. Surge.
-------------------------------------------------
| Gym Leader: Lt. Surge                         |
| For: Orange Badge                             |
|                                               |
| Raichu- Lt. Surges most powerful, Raichu likes|
| to use strong electric attacks. A strong rock |
| or ground type Pokémon should be enough to    |
| beat it.                                      |
|                                               |
| Magneton- Lt. Surges most annoying Pokémon,   |
| Magneton uses it's speed and cheap attacks to |
| win the match. Once again, use another strong |
| rock or ground type Pokémon to win.           |
|                                               |
| Electabuzz- A strong and fast Pokémon, that,  |
| like Raichu uses strong electric attacks. It  |
| is a pure electric type Pokémon, so rock or   |
| ground with an ice move, maybe a Kabuto or    |
| Kabutops will be perfect.                     |
|                                               |
| Electrode- A weak, but fast electric Pokémon, |
| Electrode won't really be much of a challange |
| for you. Use an ice or rock type              |
|                                               |
| Electrode- Use the same strategy as you used  |
| on the previuos Electrode to beat it.         |
-------------------------------------------------

        After easily defeating Lt. Surge, it is time to go to Saffron City.
Once you get to Saffron City, you'll notice that Silph. Co. Has been blocked
off by a guard who won't let you go upstairs. Anyway, we aren't worrying
about Silph. Co. right now. We are worrying about your tenth badge right now.
You have to fight Sabrina. After all these years, she is still working as a
Pokémon Gym Leader. Her gym is exactly the same, and the trainers are still
there. This time, it is harder to avoid gym trainers in her gym, because
they are constantly looking in all different directions. They also have a
longer sight range. You should fight them anyway. Sabrina has a new look, but
she doesn't look entirely different like some other trainers will further in
the game.
-------------------------------------------------
| Gym Leader: Sabrina                           |
| For: Gold Badge                               |
|                                               |
| Mr.Mime- An easy, but annoying Pokémon,       |
| Mr.Mime will like to mimic your attacks and   |
| minimize itself during battle.                |
|                                               |
| Alakazam- A Very powerful, but also very weak |
| defensive Pokémon, Alakazam uses pure psychic |
| moves, so be careful.                         |
|                                               |
| Eifi- Another weak Pokémon, maybe a little bit|
| stronger, Eifi will also use psychic attacks, |
| so be careful.                                |
-------------------------------------------------

        She is even easier than Lt. Surge, but not the easiest trainer in the
world.

	Befor anything, go to the power plant near Cerulean City.
You will have to surf to get there. Inside the Power Plant, talk
to everybody. When you are leaving, someone will say something
to you. Leave the power Plant.

        Now you have to go to Cerulian City. When you get there,
you will notice that the place looks pretty much the same. However,
when you go into Misty's gym, you'll notice that the gym is empty.
A Team Rocket trainer will bump into you and leave. After you leave
the gym, go north. You will be going in the direction where Bill's
lighthouse used to be. You will fight the Rocket Trainer you met in
the gym and he will confess to you after you beat him that he hid
something in the Cerulian City gym.

        Take the piece that you got from the gym and go to what
used to be the power plant in older Pokémon games. The person here
will thank you and give you a TM, and you are now eligible for a
radio upgrade. Go back to Lavander town and go in the radio station.
The man standing looking at the wall will give you a radio upgrade,
which allows you to awaken the Snorlax.

        It isn't over yet. Now you must go to Vermillion City, and
enter the Pokémon Lovers Club. A man sitting at the table will give
you his Pokémon doll that was sitting next to him. Remember copycat
from Saffron City in Red,Blue, Yellow, and Green? She of course
still loves dolls, and does a really creepy impression of you, but
when you bring her the doll, she will give you an item that will
allow you to travel between the two maps much easier.

        Go back to the gym. In the little pool in the middle, you will find
what the trainer was talking about, a missing part that belongs to the power
station in the left upper corner. When you reach what used to be Bill's
lighthouse, you will find Misty, and she will be smooching, as quoted from
Pokémon Zero. She will then return to her gym, suprised from what just
happened. Don't surf in the waters to get it. It is in the upper right hand
area which can be obtained without ever going into the water.

        When you return to her gym, you will see that she is no piece of cake
like the last two gyms were. Misty is not to hard.

-------------------------------------------------
| Gym Leader: Misty                             |
| For:                                          |
|                                               |
| Golduck- Has Misty finally evolved her        |
| Psyduck? It appears so. Golduck will have some|
| strong water attacks, so use an electric or   |
| grass type to defeat it.                      |
|                                               |
| Nuo- Evolved from Upaa, Nuo doesn't really put|
| up too much of a fight. Once again, a grass or|
| electric type will save the day.              |
|                                               |
| Lapras- Being a little harder, and more       |
| diffucult to defeat if you have a special type|
| Pokémon, Lapras is unfourtanetly a psychic and|
| water type. A long battle will take place, and|
| an electric Pokémon should win the battle.    |
|                                               |
| Starmie- Another psychic and water type, but  |
| it has recover, which you'll learn becomes    |
| extremely annoying. Use a grass or electric   |
| type once again to defeat it.                 |
-------------------------------------------------

        After you defeat Misty, you can now get your 12th badge from Erika.
So go to Celadon City. You can play slots here, and the big PokTmart is also
still here. If you go in the back of the house, you won't get an Eevee, and
a floor has been cut off of the place. You can go around front of the same
building and still look at the programmers things.

        Now it is time to fight Erika.
-------------------------
| Gym Leader: Erika     |
| For: Rainbow Badge    |
| Tangela               |
| Victreebell           |
| Vileplume             |
| Kireihana             |
-------------------------

        After defeating Erika, you now must take the Bicycle path down the
trail. When you reach the bottom, you will go right and end up in Fushia
City. The town is almost perfect...Until you find out that the Safari Zone
has been removed! Go in the houses and talk to the people. Now you can get
your 13th badge! The leader in this gym is obviously not Koga. She will
use Poision and Bug types, just like Koga did.
-------------------------
| Gym Leader: Anzu      |
| For: ?                |
| Kurobatto             |
| Ariadosu              |
| Weezing               |
| Weezing               |
| Venomoth              |
-------------------------

        After defeating her, It is time to awaken the Snorlax that blocks
your path.

        Using your upgraded radio, fly back to Vermillion City, and go to the
Snorlax. Tune into the second to last station, and push A. The music will
begin to play. When the music begins to play, return to the game and talk to
the Snorlax. It will wake up, and like before, attack in a grumpy manner.

        The Snorlax is a great Pokémon to catch. It heals itself after every
move it does, and when it rests, it will do a very harmful attack. It also
still has headbutt. It will also learn Hyper Beam at level 57! However, the
fact that it slightly heals itself after every attack, even while sleeping,
makes this Pokémon very diffucult to catch. I finally used my Master Ball
equivelent. It was well used.

        After the battle with Snorlax, go in the cave that was blocked by it.
You are in Diglett's Cave. You may catch a Diglett if you want. Dugtrio's
also randomly appear.

        When you come out of the cave, you will find yourself just South of
Pewter City. Brock is the gym leader here.
-------------------------
| Gym Leader: Brock     |
| For: ?                |
| Graveler              |
| Onix                  |
| Rhyhorn               |
| Omastar               |
| Kabutops              |
-------------------------

        After defeating Brock, go east to Mt. Moon. When you get to Mt. Moon,
you will encounter your rival for the first time in a long time. This may or
may not be the final time you battle her, but she is strong, and she appears
to be going somwhere important after you defeat her. Go upstairs, and into
the house. Face the man. Tune into the same frequency you tuned into
for Snorlax. This is supposedly a way to obtain Serebii, but has not
been proven.

you'll need to go south. You can try to stop
at the Viridian City gym, but no one is there...At least now.
Instead, go south, until you reach Pallet Town. Go inside Prof.
Oak's Lab and talk to him. He will tell you to go face the Seafoam
Island Gym leader, because Cinnibar Island no longer has people
living on it. Talk to Professor Oak's mputer also.

        Surf to Cinnibar Island anyway, and talk to the mysterious person
here. He will shoot up into the sky and leave. Could that have been Gary Oak?

        Keep surfing to Seafoam Island, fighting trainers along the way, and
eventually you'll get there. Inside the place, you'll meet up with Blane.
-------------------------
| Gym Leader: Blane     |
| For: ?                |
| Magakarugo            |
| Rapidash              |
| Magmar                |
-------------------------

        After defeating Blane, you should return to Pallet Town and talk to
Prof. Oak again. He will tell you to go to the Viridian City gym. Go North,
heading for the gym, and fight any missed trainers. Finally, when you get to
the gym, you will see that it is no longer empty. There is one person in
here, and his name is.......Gary!
-------------------------
| Gym Leader: Gary      |
| For: ?                |
| Pidgeot               |
| Alakazam              |
| Exeguttor             |
| Rhydon                |
| Arcanine              |
| Gyrados               |
-------------------------

        Gary is not so easy. He may take numerous tries to beat. Use a good
strategy, but remember, unless you know Japanese, there is no way of telling
what Pokémon he will use next, for every trainer uses Pokémon in different
orders.

        After you beat Gary, you now have 16 badges! It isn't over yet. go
back to Pallet Town and talk to Professor Oak. He will tell you that there is
something related to Pokémon that is sure to suprise in the mountains.

        Once again, go back to Viridian City, but head west, and go to where
Pokémon League used to be. When you enter the building, keep going west, and
go out the door. You will now be in the mountains that Prof. Oak was talking
about. The Pokémon here are extremely strong. There is a Pokémon Center here
also which also allows you to fly back here at any given time.

        Eventually, you will come across a cave in which you need Flash to
see. Collect the items here and make your way through the cave. The final
room in the cave will hold none other than the famous Pokémon Trainer Ash
Ketchum himself! Talk to him, he will not say anything. You will just begin
battling him.
------------------------------------------------|
| Final Battle: Ash Ketchum                     |
| For: Bragging Rights                          |
|                                               |
| Pikachu- Lv. 81- A rock type Pokémon such as  |
| an expirenced Donphan should be able to take  |
| out Pikachu easily.                           |
|                                               |
| Efi- Lv. 79- A psychic evolution of Eevee that|
| is one of the hardest Pokémon Ash will use.   |
| have something good or it's Psychic moves can |
| easily take out any of your Pokémon quickly.  |
|                                               |
| Blastiose- Lv. 77- I had the final showdown   |
| between the Blastoise and my Odairu, used     |
| Slash, and knocked out the Blastoise with only|
| a little bit of trouble.                      |
|                                               |
| Venusaur- Lv. 77- Constantly takes advantage  |
| of being a grass type by using Solar Beam and |
| Razor Leaf.                                   |
|                                               |
| Charizard- An easy Pokémon. If you have a     |
| water type, he/she should be very easy to     |
| defeat.                                       |
|                                               |
| Snorlax- Lv. 79-Possibly Ash's hardest Pokémon|
|  He constantly heals himself and uses very    |
|  stong moves. Good luck!                      |
-------------------------------------------------

        After you defeat Ash, the credits will roll.
Congradulations, you have completely beaten the game! Every couple
of days, Ash will return to the mountain if you want to rematch him
or just get plain old experience.


*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 6. Routes 1-29 and the S.S. Aqua
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*


        After achieving all eight badges, and defeating the orange
leage, you will be able to go to the old world, that was once only
able to go to in the Previous versions of the Pokémon games. Fly
back to the town where you got your 6th badge, or the one with the
really tall lighthouse in which you had to get the gym leader to
come down from. Go south. You will be able to board Aqua-gou, and
fight Pokémon trainers while waiting. Make sure you are healed
before you go here, for there is no Pokémon treatment center on the
boat.

        Eventually, you will arrive at Vermillion city. A lot of the
music has been remixed to almost sound like the old games. Here, you
can fight Lt. Surge, Misty, Erika, Sabrina, A new trainer at Koga's
gym, Brock and even Ash Ketchum himself! Sure this section tells you
how to get to routes 1-29, but the walkthrough section will tell you
exactly what to do when you get there.

        You can go back on the Aqua-gou anytime you want, but you may
not know how to get off of the boat. Well before I thought it was a
specified amount of time you had to wait to get off, but I now know
that you can goto sleep in the bed at your room and when you wake up,
you'll be able to leave.

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

 9. Frequently Asked Questions
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*


        These are actual e-mails I get from people. I try my hardest to answer their
questions as best I can, and if I recieve an e-mail about a question that is answered in this
section, I will most likely ignore it.


Q: I can't figure out the correct order to flip the switches in the Team Rocket Basement.

A: Start at the left and flip all switches to the right in order. You should now be able
to get through to the elevator.


Q: Where and how do I get the 'Squirtle Water'?

A: You can get the squirtle water from the most extreme north
eastern house in the town where you get your normal badge. A
lady in the house will give it to you.


Q: What ARE those symbols next to my Pokémon's Icon for?

A: There are a numnber of answers. First things first, we know you've attached an item to
your Pokémon by selecting attach from the backpack. However, you may have attached
anything from a potion to a King's Crown to it. To figure out what is attached to it, go
to Pokémon from the main menu and move to the statistics section of your Pokémon's info.
You will see what item is attached to it.


Q: How do I get the radio? I've heard about the upgraded radio, but I don't even have the
first one!

A: To get the radio, go to the place that Team Rocket will or has taken over and walk
up to the girl on the far right standing behind the counter. Talk to her and answer
yes, yes, yes, no, yes, no.


Q: How do I solve the first ice maze?

A: This question is answered above in this strategy guide. I am the man.


Q: I don't know how to withdraw and deposit Pokémon, can you help me?

A: Ok, this is wehere there was a glitch in the game. On one of my files, when I
caught Pokémon, they could not be withdrawn. I had them set to go in box 7, and box
seven still holds them, but when I go into it, it shows no Pokémon.


Q: How do I awaken the Snorlax that blocks me from entering the
cave in Vermillion city?

A: Get a radio upgrade from the man in Lavander town who is standing in the building.
You'll have to find a missing tool in Misty's gym first in order to do this.

Q: Where is Misty?

A: Go to Bill's lighthouse, and enter. Misty will be in love with someone, and when they
see you, they both run off. Misty will return to her gym, and you can fight her from
there. Make sure you get the missing part in her gym!


Q: Where can I get a lot of expirence?

A: You can obtain a fair amount of experience by fighting RED, or by going to Vermillion
City and fighting your clone in the basement in the Mirage Center. You will face an
image of yourself, and his Pokémon will give you a larger amount of experience than
usual.


Q: Is it possible to catch Pikachu and Marrill in this game?

A: Of course it is. Your Pokédex can easily tell you how to find these Pokémon, but
I will tell you anyway. Pikachu can be caught just above Viridian city, and below
Pewter City. Just south of what is left of the Viridian forest, you will see a patch
of grass. Here you can catch Pikachu, both male and female gender. Maril is caught in
caves east of Asagi, or the town with the ghost gym.


Q: How do I get other evolutionary Pokémon from before like Bellosom?

A: Using different stones on other Pokémon cause different things to happen. For
instance, using a leaf stone on Gloom will evolve it into Vileplume, but if you use
the solar stone on it, it will evolve into Bellosom.


Q: WHERE IN THE WORLD DO I FIND TM08?!?!

A: You can get the TM08 from a man east of where you fought SudoWoodo. Additionally,
you can get TM08 from the Casino as a prize.


Q: Can I use this strategy guide on my website?

A: No. Just kidding. Read the section Website Usage Terms.

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 10. Breeding
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

        Breeding is one of the main key features of Pokémon Gold and Silver, and it's
definetly something that makes it stand out from the rest. Breeding also opens up new
possibilites, and can help you recieve an endless supply of rare Pokémon. But perhaps the
best thing about breeding is that is not only helps you tremendously, it opens up a whole
new world of evolution. Brand new 'pre-evolution' Pokémon are being discovered, and it's
only the beginning.

	To breed Pokémon, go to the town in which you acuired your third badge, the one
with Mirutanku the cow Pokémon. Go south from this town until you come across a house.
Inside, an old man and woman take care of Pokémon and even run own their own breeding
farm! Give a male version of a Pokémon to the man, and a female Pokémon to the woman.
Leave and walk around or do something for a while. When you come back, the man will be
standing outside and he will give you an egg. You can also get your Pokémon back. After a
certian amount of steps, the egg will hatch and you will have a brand new
Pokémon on level 5!

Pre-Evolutionary Pokémon:

Pichu --------> Pikachu
Cleffa -------> Clefairy
Elekid -------> Electabuzz
Igglybuff ----> Jigglypuff
Magby --------> Magmar
Smoochum -----> Jynx


*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 11. Evolution
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

	So before you go and e-mail me about the evolutionary stones, read this section. I
don't want you to bother me with this, and NO E-MAIL ABOUT THEM WILL BE ANSWERED.

Go to route 25 and go into the sea cottage. Inside, you will find Bill's grandfather. Show
him the following Pokémon on the days (I do not know exactly what days) that it'll work to
recieve one evolutionary stone.

-------------------------------------------
| What you show him:  |   What you'll get:|
|-----------------------------------------|
| Vulpix              |   Fire Stone      |
| Staryu              |   Water Stone     |
| Oddish              |   Leaf Stone      |
| Pichu               |   Thunder Stone   |
-------------------------------------------

Moon Stone
 Can be found on Route 27.

Solar Stone
 Will be awarded for winning the Bug Catching Tournament.


 New Types of Evolutions:

	To Get Slowbro to evolve into Slowking, you have to equip it with the King's Rock,
which you'll get from Azela Town's Slowpoke Well. Bring a Pokémon that has Rock Smash
along, and you'll find a new path which leads to the King's Crown

	To Get Scyther to evolve into Scizor, you have to equip it with the Metal Coat,
which you get after you find the mans daughter on the S.S. Aqua. You'll find her daugher
bugging the captian.

	To Make Onix evolve into Stelix, equip it with the Metal Coat and trade it to
another game.

        To make Porygon evolve into Porygon2, equip it with the upgrade, and trade it to
another game. You can get it in the Saffron City Building from the man who blocks your
path to the upstairs.

        To make your Poliwrath evolve into Politoed, you have to equip it with the King's
Rock, which you'll get from Azela Town's Slowpoke Well. Bring a Pokémon that has Rock Smash
along, and you'll find a new path which leads to the King's Crown.


Happiness Evolutions:

Some Pokémon won't evolve for you until they are happy. To make them happy, always use
them, don't ever let them get weak. Win battles with them (Ex: Elite Four, Red, etc.) and
let them hold items. Get them haircuts from Goldenrod City, and let Blue's sister play
with them In pallet Between 4-5 P.M. Don't let them faint, lose battles, store them in
boxes or trade them away.

Pokémon that Evolve via Happiness:
Eevee --------> Espeon (If evolves during the day [5 a.m. - 6 p.m.])
Eevee --------> Umbreon (If evolves during night [6 p.m. - 5 a.m.])
Chansey ------> Blissey
Golbat -------> Crobat
Togepi -------> Togetic
Pichu --------> Pikachu
Clef ---------> Clefairy
Igglybuff ----> Jugglypuff

 13. Neat Things
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*


        This section will talk about some neat tricks in the game that do not fit into any
of the other catagories, but are still a part of the game.

	-After you have the S.S. Aqua ticket, you can ride on it any Monday or Friday. To
get off of it, take a rest in your cabin.

        -Let mom collect your money. Eventually, she will call you on the phone and tell
you she has bought you useful items and even decorations for your room!

	- This strategy guide was written by Donphan. You might be wondering why I put
this here. Well if someone steals this strategy guide and says they wrote it, 9 out of 10
chances say they miss this. Hehe.

	-Go east of Fushia City and catch a Chansey, go around the turn and up to find a
patch of grass with a girl standing in it. She will trade the Chansey you caught for an
Aerodactyl!

	-Did you know that you can use the select button as a hot key? When in your bag,
push the select button. Push it again to confirm it. Now when you are looking through
pocket that the item was in and you push select, you will automaticly go to that item!

	-Did you know that you can face your friends anytime of the day? Even if they
aren't there? Here's how to do it: Using two Gameboy COLORS, start up the game and
choose the FOURTH option. This will let you and your friend trade teams, allowing you to
fight your friend instead of your clone in Viridian City.

	-Pokémon Centers Keep Track of your records! Your game can store your stats against
others for up to 5 people!

 14. Rare Pokémon
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

        It turns out that there are more rare Pokémon than you think
there are.

There are currently 8 legendary Pokémon.
059. Arcanine*
144. Articuno
145. Zapdos
146. Moltres
243. Raikou
244. Entei
245. Suikun
249. Lugia
250. Ho-Oh

------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       Ho-Oh- A legend says that it's body glows in seven colors.  A   |
| rainbow is said to form behind it when it flies.			|
|									|
| Type 1: Fire  Type 2: Flying                                          |
|                                                                       |
|	-Gold Version: Ho-Oh Lv. 40                                     |
|	In Gold Version, catching Ho-Oh should be easy. After beating 	|
| the Orange League, and clearing the event at the Radio Tower, you 	|
| will get a Rainbow feather. Return to the town in which you achieved 	|
| your Phantom Badge. A house in the northern part of the town will have|
| stairs, and you will end up following a path that will take you to the|
| top of the building and Ho-Oh will be there. Save, for Houou is a Rare|
| Pokémon, and if you don't catch it the first time, you will never get |
| a chance to fight it again.                                           |
|                                                                       |
|	-Silver Version: Ho-Oh Lv. 70                                   |
|       After beating the game, go to the old world, and get a Rainbow  |
| Feather from Pewter City. Now you can get Ho-Oh from the roof of a    |
| building in the town in which you achieved your Phantom Badge.	|
|                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       Lugia- It is said to be the guardian of the seas.  It is rumored|

|       After beating the game, go to the old world, and get a Silver   |
| Feather from the man in the eastern part of Pewter City. Go back to 	|
| the new world, and surf over to the islands. Go in the upper right 	|

|       Clear the event at the radio tower. You will recieve a Silver   |

| The three Legendary Cat Pokémon					|

| Pokémon Numbers 243, 244, and 245                                     |
|       You can bring them to life from statues by using TM08 to break 	|
| the rocks in the town where you fight the ghost gym. Fall to the lower|
| level and go up the stairs. You will see three statues, and when you 	|
| are about to enter the platform they are on, they spring to life, each|
|one its own signifigant color and type, and scatter out of the cave to |
| freely roam through the world. However, once you have seen them once 	|
|and battled them, their HP will not be healed, and you will be able to |
| locate them on by using your Pokédex.     				|
|                                                                       |
|       What makes this game harder and this strategy guide look bad is |
| the fact that the only way to catch these legendary Pokémon is to find|
| them on either map. I haven't even found one of them yet. If you are  |
| having trouble finding them, there is nothing I can do to help you. 	|
| Keep trying and good luck!                				|
|                                                                       |
| Yes, you heard me right, they are cat Pokémon, not dog Pokémon. There |
| is an electric type, an Ice type, and a Fire type. (Does this remind 	|
| you of other Legendary Pokémon?)                                     	|
|                                                             		|
|       However, there is an easier way to catch these Pokémon. If you 	|
| want a strong PokTball, go to the most southern town on the new map. 	|
| Go to the nut tree next to the house. After you pick the nut, go into |
| the house, and give the old man the nut. Come back the next day to get|
| the speed ball. It acts as a very advanced ball and I think it ensures|
| a catch every time. It would make a lot of sense, considering there 	|
| are so many rare Pokémon.    						|
|									|
| Strategy for catching the Legendary Creatures:			|
|	  								|
|	  Because it is very hard to catch the Legendary Cats, because 	|
| they run away from you everytime they fight you, a strategy was 	|
| developed. To more easily catch the cats, bring along a level 39 	|
| Pokémon with you, and bring along a lot of gold spray (Super Repel). 	|
| Now go into a area, (On the West Side) and make sure you fight no 	|
| Pokémon above or equal to level 40 where you think a legendary cat 	|
| might be hiding. You will not be able to fight any Pokémon except for	|
| the cat you are looking for!			    			|
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       Eevee- You can get unlimited amounts of Eevee's in this game. I |
| wouldn't have put this in this section, but because I recieve such 	|
| large amounts of e-mails concerning Eevee, I put it here. You can get |
| Eevee as many times as you want by going to the casino house in the   |
| town where you achieved your normal badge. Eevee costs 6,666.      	|
|                                                                      	|
| Evolving Eevee into Umbreon and Espeon                                |
|       To evolve Eevee into Umbreon, the evil Eevee, always use it and |
| keep it with you. Eventually, it will evolve into Umbreon, an evil 	|
| type Pokémon.								|
|									|
|       To evolve Eevee into Espeon, always keep Eevee with you in your |
| team and use it a lot. Eventually, not on any particular level, it 	|
| will evolve into the Psychic type Pokémon, Espeon.  			|
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Selebi								|
|									|
|									|
|	Rumor #1 says you can get Celebi by catching all 26 Annons and  |
| solving all four Pokémon Puzzles then playing a strange sounding song |
| on the upgraded radio. It is rumored that after you do this, you will |
| encounter a level 5 Celebi. This is not confirmed, and I have not     |
| attempted to do it, so don't e-mail me about it.			|
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|

* Even though you can get unlimited numbers of this Pokémon, in the Pokédex, it is
described as a legendary Pokémon. However, that is in previous versions of Pokémon.

 14.01 Unown
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

	Unown isn't very rare, but this didn't fit into any other catagories and I wasn't
making a whole new section just for this.

	There are 26 Unown. They all represent one letter of the alphabet. Once you catch
3 Unown, you will be given the Unown dex by a labratory scientist from the lab nearby. The
Unown dex will keep track of all of the Unown you caught. Here is the meaning of them...

A - Angry
B - Bear
C - Chase
D - Direct
E - Engage
F - Find
G - Give
H - Help
I - Increase
J - Join
K - Keep
L - Laugh
M - Make
N - Nuzzle
O - Observe
P - Perform
Q - Quicken
R - Reassure
S - Search
T - Tell
U - Undo
V - Vanish
W - Want
X - XXXXX
Y - Yield
Z - Zoom


Certian Unown won't appear until you complete the puzzles hidden throughtout Union Cave.
The first puzzle is the Kabuto Puzzle, followed by the Omanyte Puzzle, Aerodactyl Puzzle,
and finally the Ho-oh Puzzle. Here is what letter of Unown the puzzles open up.

Puzzle 1: Kabuto Puzzle
Opens up: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K

Puzzle 2: Omanyte Puzzle

 20. The Casino
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

	What's more addicting than the actual game itself? None other then the two
different casino games. You can play the origional slot machine in color, or you could
play the new memory-type game, which is enough reason to buy this game.

	Before you can play, you have to have the coin case. You can obtain the coin case
in the underGround section at Kogane City (with Mirutanku the cow Pokémon in the gym). It
will be an item sitting on the floor. There you have it, you can now play the games!

	If you didn't know, there are two different cities that have a casino in them. They
are Kogane City (The city with Mirutanku, the cow Pokémon) and Celadon City.

	Unlike the older version of Pokémon, the slot machines are not rigged. Well, almost.
This time, they'll plain old cheat, but what the shocking thing is, they cheat for YOU.
Ok, you are trying to line up three 7's, which will earn you 300 coins. You get the first
Seven, no problem. The second time, the seven was only one above your last seven, making
it impossible to win - this is where the computer cheats, they'll knock that seven that
wasn't in the right spot to the row with your first seven. Now it is time for your third
seven. You push A, but you missed! The computer has a few tricks (or 8 662lb Rock Pokémon)
up their sleeve. 8 Golem's will fall down, knocking down a block each time, if after 8
Golem's, it lands on Seven, you'll win your 300 coins.

        The second, or new game, the memory-type game, the computer will let YOU cheat.
To do this, go all the way up into the upper-left hand corner and push over and up. You
will be able to highlight two full rows, either vertically or horizontally instead of
just one block. This increases your chanses of winning by almost 50%!

        Do not e-mail those people asking for Pokémon questions. Most of them only
contributed very small things to the faq and I am sure they wouldn't like to be bothered
with silly questions, espically if those questions are allready answered in this FAQ
which happens 99% of the time.

	It's be only right to thank Nintendo, Creatures, and GAMEFREAK for making a won-
derful sequel to a great game.

	Feel free to E-mail me for help in Pokémon Gold/Silver, but if you do, please
make sure it is not in the strategy guide allready. If the question was allready
answered in this strategy guide, your e-mail will be unanswered and deleted.

	DO NOT ASK ME FOR ANY ROMs, any e-mail asking for ROMs will be automatically de-
leted by my mail client

	This guide was created on January 2, 2001.

        When you're looking for the latest version of this FAQ, check www.GameFAQs.com.
That would be the original site to contain the guide, and it's the only site that EVER
updates my FAQ on time <cough>DAVE</cough>. Under extreme circumstances may you contact me
at SuperLuigi@msn.com. I do not want junk mail or common Pokémon questions.

	Uhhh... Yeah, you can print the guide. Don't ask me why, but I've actually gotten
e-mail asking me if this was ok. You may print it as long as you do not distribuite it
for a profit.
