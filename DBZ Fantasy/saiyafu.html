Before we begin with Saiya-Fu, you should go to <a href="bringout.html">The Saiyajin Within</a>

The art of Saiya-Fu...Revealed! What is Saiya-Fu? Saiya-Fu is the style of fighting used by the Saiyajins for thousands of years! Now after thousands of years, the art of Saiya-Fu, has been revealed! Any of those who wish to learn it, contiue to read, but be warned! After learning Saiya-Fu, you will never be the same!
<P>
A few things that could happen as a change to your life in result of learning Saiya-Fu. You could develop an uncontrolable thirst for battle. You may see everyone as nothing but an opponent, an enemy. You may begin to do things you never thought you would do. Those are just a few things that could happen. You have been warned, if you wish to continue then do so...
</OL>
The first thing you must learn, is one of the many stances. You could use the stance used by Gokou. You could use Vegeta's stance. To veiw these stances, ceck the picture links below.
<BR>
<a href="images/gokoustance.gif">Gokou</a>
<P>
Once you have gotten the stance, your ready for some of the moves...
<OL>
*<B>The Fist Grab</B>- You may have seen Gokou do this, he grabbed his opponents fist and began to crush it in his hand.
<P>
*<B>The Handlock powerup</B>- Vegeta did this to Freeza, it was when he grabbed Freeza's hands and he began to charge up. Their hands were locked together because they were both holding on as they charged. Very good move if you want to charge up and not worry about being hit.
<P>
*<B>What I like to call the Fly high blast</B>- Vegeta flew up high into the sky then shot a huge beam towards his opponent. Flying high and farther away from your opponent can make it easier for you to charge up an attack, and have more time before your opponent gets near.
<P>
*<B>Gut Blast</B>- You slam your hand into your opponents guts, once you feel the guts on your hands release a blast into your opponents body, it should send him flying if he doesnt explode.
<P>
*<B>The Scare your opponent while looking cool</B>- Remember when gokou scared Jeice and Ginyu? All he did was power up and he looked pretty cool at the same time. Well thats it, just power up getting yourself to your strongest and look cool, and youve done it!
<P>
*<B>Get Influence from your dad and get stronger</B>- Get your dad to tell you stuff to influence you, make you feel stronger, then fire a huge beam at your opponent.
</OL>

Once you have learned a few from above, you are ready for Saiya-Fu! Soon you will be the Saiya-Fu master! After a few more of the lessons are posted, you will be ready.
<P>
<B>Charging</B>
<P>
We've all seen the Saiyajins charge up. Thy always look like there getting pissed off, and sometimes they even look constipated! Well, thats the nest thing you need to work on. I'm not saying you should sit in front of your mirror and make funny faces. Try to draw out on your <I>ki.</I> If you dont know what ki is then here is a little difinetion.
<OL>
<B>KI-</B> (Pronounced <I>Chee</I>) According to the Ancient chinese and japanese beleifs, Ki was a force that existed in all living things. The ancient chinese shoalin monks were supposedly able to project their ki in beams of light from their bodies. The fighters in DragonBall have the same abilities.
</OL>
Now that you know this, you must learn how to project your ki! You've got to learn how to pull yourki outward. Ki isnt only used or fireballs or beams of light. That is mnuch harder to learn. But youcan use it for speed, or strength. To harness the power of your ki will take much concnetration and hard work. So get too it! And dont hurt yourself trying to charge up.
<P>

This section is just here as entertainment, it is not meant to be used for information. All of the moves listed above are things that were used in the show, but I gave them the names. I didnot make up the moves, just the names. Do not take this section seriously, I am not responsible for the trouble you get into for doing the "Gut Blast" or the "Fist Grab!" this section is not for information, or self defense! And please no Emails about the name above being wrong, do not correct me, its not supposed to be the right name!
