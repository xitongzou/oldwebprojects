<p>Saiyan Saga</p>
      <p>1. Raditz vs. Farmer</p>
      <p>Raditz got out of his pod, and was threatened by a farmer with a shotgun. 
        The Saiyan made short work of the weakling, killing him with one attack.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>2. Raditz vs. Piccolo</p>
      <p>This was hardly a fight, but merely Piccolo attacking Raditz. The Saiyan 
        was about to destroy the Namek when his scouter located Goku, so he flew 
        off to find his brother.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>3. Raditz vs. Goku</p>
      <p>Again, not essentially a fight, Raditz simply kneed Goku in the stomach, 
        and gave him some tasks to do, then kidnapped Gohan. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>4. Raditz vs. Goku and Piccolo</p>
      <p>This went on for a short while, with Goku and Piccolo getting beaten 
        up, but continuing to fight, even though things looked bleak. Goku wound 
        up on the floor, nearing unconsciousness, and Piccolo was left helplessly 
        charging up an attack. Raditz trod on Goku, and began crushing his ribs.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>5. Gohan vs. Raditz</p>
      <p>When Gohan heard his fathers cries, he burst out of his pod, and headbutted 
        Raditz right in the ribs. This hurt the Saiyan, and with one firm swipe, 
        he knocked the kid out, surprised at how easy it was to defeat his nephew. 
        He then turned to Piccolo to finish him off</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>6. Raditz vs. Goku and Piccolo</p>
      <p>Goku managed to get up off the floor, and grabbed Raditz in a full nelson, 
        holding him still, so that he couldn't escape. Piccolo finished charging 
        up his beam, and shot it at Goku's brother, with the beam ripping right 
        through the chest of both Saiyans, killing them both. Goku's noble sacrifice 
        saved the Earth.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>7. Raditz vs. Enma</p>
      <p>Little is known of this fight, seeing how we only heard Enma talking 
        about it, but from what I can gather, Raditz put up a fight before he 
        was sent to hell, and decided to fight King Enma, losing miserably.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>8. Gohan vs. T-Rex</p>
      <p>This happens when Piccolo made Gohan train in the wilderness, to learn 
        survival skills. Gohan was chased by a T-Rex, and bullied by it for a 
        while, until he grew stronger, and brave enough to fight back. Throughout 
        the time he was there from then on, he chopped bits off the fleeing T-Rex's 
        tail, to teach it a lesson, and tio get some tasty dinner.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>9. Oozaru Gohan vs. Piccolo</p>
      <p>When Piccolo returned to train Gohan, he noticed that Gohan looked up 
        at the moon. He was powerless to stop the rampage of Gohan in his confused 
        Oozaru state, and ended up destroying the moon.</p>
      <p>They fought a second time when a hologram was created from out of an 
        old Saiyan pod, creating the exact illusion of the moon. Gohan turned 
        Oozaru again, and created turmoil for a while until Piccolo located the 
        source of the fake moon, and destroyed it. After both times, he pulled 
        off Gohan's tail, only to have it grow back.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>10. Piccolo vs. Gohan</p>
      <p>Whilst training the young Saiyan, Piccolo did some basic combat sessions 
        with him, where they fought against each other. Piccolo easily won every 
        time, although he was impressed at the kids obvious strength, which constantly 
        increased throughout the course of the time spent in the wilderness.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>11. Goku vs. Ogre</p>
      <p>Goku fell off Snake Way, and was forced to fight an Ogre in a wrestling 
        match. To win, he had to get his opponent out of a circle. The Ogre started 
        things off by pushing the Saiyan to the edge, but then Goku pushed him 
        away, and created a gust of wind by punching the air ridiculously fast, 
        knocking the Ogre over the line.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>12. Goku vs. Giant Snake</p>
      <p>As Goku neared the end of Snake Way, he went into a palace to eat. Here 
        he was greeted by a princess, and treated like a king, until he decided 
        he had to go. The occupants of the palace didn't like this, and turned 
        nasty on the Saiyan, revealing the truth - That the palace was actually 
        a giant snake, and Goku was inside of it. He escaped, and managed to use 
        his silky flying skills to make the snake tangle itself up, and become 
        harmless.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>13. Goku vs. Gregory</p>
      <p>During the time at King Kai's, Goku had to hit a cricket named Gregory 
        on the head with a giant sledgehammer. Whilst this may not essentially 
        be a fight, harmful contact was made, so I class it as one. After destroying 
        the whole planet, Goku eventually got a hit on Gregory, albeit light, 
        but causing a huge lump none the less.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>14. Tien vs. Saibaman</p>
      <p>The first of the fights against the Saiyans Vegeta and Nappa begins with 
        Tien taking on a small green alien called a Saibaman. Nappa planted six 
        of these in the Earth, and they all grew immediately into warriors. Each 
        had the power level of Raditz, and should have been worthy opposition. 
        Tien proved his superiority by easily defeating his opponent. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>15. Yamcha vs. Saibaman</p>
      <p>The fight started as Yamcha stepped forward, deciding to take his turn 
        to fight before Krillen. He fought valiantly, and eventually defeated 
        his opponent with a powerful attack. Thinking the Saibaman was dead, Yamcha 
        turned to the rest of them, and challenged them all. Meanwhile, the one 
        that the 'Desert Bandit' beat up isn't really dead, and is getting up, 
        behind Yamcha. Suddenly it dived onto him, taking him completely by surprise, 
        and clinged on tight. Yamcha couldn't escape, and the Saibaman self-destructed 
        dishonorably, killing them both like a coward. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>16. Krillen vs. Saibamen</p>
      <p>Stepping forward, Krillen decides on doing what Yamcha was going to before 
        he died, and takes on all four of the remaining Saibamen. He unleashes 
        an awesome blast which kills all of them outright, except for one, that 
        escaped somehow. When the smoke clears, Krillen sees the damage he caused, 
        although the two Saiyans who were caught in the blast, don't even bear 
        a scratch.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>17. Piccolo vs. Saibaman</p>
      <p>The remaining little green man tries to jump Gohan, but just as he swings 
        for the kid, his arm his caught by Piccolo. The Namek then throws him 
        directly up into the air, and blasts him with a breath blast, disintegrating 
        him immediately, and killing him outright.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>18. Tien vs. Nappa</p>
      <p>Tien basically gets kicked around the floor for a while, until the fight 
        is intervened, and Chao-zu steps in, despite Tien begging him to back 
        off. Tien loses an arm in the short time that he and Nappa collide.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>19. Chao-zu vs. Nappa</p>
      <p>The little guy clings to Nappa's back in an effort to save Tien, and 
        prepares to self-destruct, trying to destroy the Saiyan once and for all. 
        His effort is in vain though, as he dies, but Nappa walks off unharmed.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>20. Gohan, Krillen, and Piccolo vs. Nappa</p>
      <p>Seeing the big guy distracted, Piccolo formulates a plan. He and Krillen 
        catch Nappa unaware, and hit him with strong attacks, managing to send 
        him soaring through the air, and setting him up for Gohan to blast him. 
        The kid is too scared though, so Krillen and Piccolo blast him instead, 
        narrowly missing. Nappa turns to them, and allows Tien an opportunity 
        to attack.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>21. Tien vs. Nappa</p>
      <p>Tien manages to get up upon seeing his best friend die, and is absolutely 
        irate. He uses the Kikouhou technique on the huge Saiyan, over and over 
        again, sucking his own life force from him each time, and barely even 
        harming Nappa. Eventually he uses it to such an extent that all his energy 
        is vanquished, and he dies, leaving Nappa to fight the remaining members 
        of the Earths special forces.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>22. Piccolo, Gohan, and Krillen vs. Nappa</p>
      <p>Piccolo comes up with another plan, where Gohan had to finish Nappa off 
        again. The kid tells him he'll do better this time, and prepares to fulfill 
        his role. Krillen powers up, directly in front of Nappa, and distracting 
        his attention. Piccolo then soars behind Nappa, and grabs his tail, expecting 
        it to be a weakness. Gohan gets ready to blast the Saiyan, but Nappa drops 
        an elbow on Piccolo's head, hurting him badly. Gohan and Krillen then 
        realize that the plan will no longer work, and that the Saiyan has won 
        the fight once again.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>23. Krillen and Piccolo vs. Nappa</p>
      <p>Nappa turns to Gohan to attack him, but Krillen steps in, and throws 
        a destructo disc at the big guy, with Nappa narrowly dodging the attack, 
        cutting his cheek. He steps forward to attack the midget, when Piccolo 
        gets up, and fires a blast at Nappa's back, annoying the Saiyan greatly, 
        but hardly hurting him at all. Nappa continued to fight, not even bothered 
        by the blow.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>24. Gohan and Piccolo vs. Nappa</p>
      <p>Gohan tells everyone to go while he holds them up for his dad, getting 
        a sudden rush of bravery. Everyone refuses to leave him though, but Nappa 
        hears this, and runs to attack the kid. Gohan stands his ground, but is 
        paralyzed with fear when the Saiyan fires a humongous blast at him, capable 
        of destroying even the toughest warriors. It is coming to fast to avoid, 
        and it looks like death for Gohan, when suddenly Piccolo dives in the 
        way, and intercepts the beam, getting fried, and consequentially killed 
        by it. Gohan remained unharmed though, and Nappa is slightly miffed that 
        he missed the kid.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>25. Gohan vs. Nappa </p>
      <p>Furious at the death of his best friend, Gohan launches a huge masenko 
        energy beam at Nappa, with the Saiyan easily swatting it away. It seemed 
        to have hurt his hand slightly, but other than that, Nappa is fine. Gohan 
        can't believe the strength of his opponent. Nappa charges in, but misses 
        Gohan somehow. He looks over, and sees that Gohan in on a small, flying 
        cloud. It's nimbus, which means that Goku is back!</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>26.Goku vs. Nappa</p>
      <p>Goku fights vengefully, trying to gain reconciliation for his friends. 
        He easily beats Nappa, but spares him, and decides that he isn't even 
        worth bothering with. When Goku let Nappa go however, the Saiyan charged 
        towards Krillen and Gohan hastily, in an effort to kill them to get at 
        Goku, who is obviously to strong for him to beat. Goku catches up using 
        the kai-o-ken technique though, and injures Nappa badly, but doesn't kill 
        him. He throws him to the feet of Vegeta sparingly, saying that the Saiyan 
        will be ok with a bit of medical help.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>27. Vegeta vs. Nappa</p>
      <p>Mercilessly, Vegeta grabs his defeated partner, throws him into the air, 
        then releases a huge blast that kills Nappa immediately. Goku can't believe 
        that the Saiyan has killed his own friend, and teammate.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>28. Goku vs. Vegeta</p>
      <p>After a fair bit of hand-to-hand where neither man could gain much of 
        an advantage, Goku used some kai-o-ken attacks, giving him the distinct 
        upper-hand in the proceedings. Vegeta realized that he couldn't win, so 
        he tried to destroy the Earth. Cunningly, Goku saw this coming, and countered 
        it with a KameHameHa, accompanied by a kai-o-ken times 4. Vegeta's blast 
        was nullified, and he was shot high into the sky, narrowly getting off 
        the beam before exiting the Earth's atmosphere, covered in pain.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>29. Oozaru Vegeta vs. Goku</p>
      <p>Vegeta lands, then throws a fake moon into the air, warning Goku that 
        the fight was about to end. He looked up at it, and underwent a transformation, 
        just like the one Gohan had gone through before. After messing around 
        a little, toying with Goku, Vegeta trod on the Saiyan, but was blasted 
        in the eye for his troubles. Angered by this, Vegeta began crushing Goku 
        in one hand.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>30. Krillen vs. Oozaru Vegeta</p>
      <p>The bald midget arrived just as Goku was about to die, so he threw a 
        destructo disc at Vegeta's tail, knowing that if his tail goes, then Vegeta 
        will go back to normal. Somehow Vegeta avoided the attack though, and 
        merely ignored the Earthlings whilst they tried to formulate a plan, knowing 
        that they couldn't even hurt Vegeta now that his strength had increased 
        so drastically.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>31. Oozaru Vegeta vs. Yajirobe</p>
      <p>Ignoring the Earthlings was a mistake Vegeta lived to regret. One that 
        he didn't even know about soared out of the shadows, and sliced his tail 
        clean off with use of a sword. Vegeta screamed in anger, and slowly shrank 
        back down to his normal form, dropping Goku onto the floor, with him hitting 
        home with a hard thud, but still clinging onto his life all the same. 
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>32. Vegeta vs. Gohan</p>
      <p>Vegeta managed to anger Gohan enough so that the kid attacked him. The 
        two matched each other punch to punch, with the weakened Vegeta unable 
        to defeat Gohan, and likewise the other way round.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>33. Goku, Krillen, and Gohan vs. Vegeta</p>
      <p>Goku gives Krillen some energy that he formed for the spirit bomb beforehand, 
        and tells him to throw it at Vegeta when the time was right. Krillen takes 
        it, and after a short while, he throws it, but somehow Vegeta knew it 
        was coming, and dodged it, leaving Gohan to take the attack. Goku telepathically 
        told him to bounce it back at Vegeta though, as it will only hurt those 
        with impure hearts. Gohan does so obediently, and knocks Vegeta flying 
        into the air.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>34. Vegeta vs. Gohan</p>
      <p>Vegeta lands on the floor with a thud, after managing to get off the 
        energy balls beam, and is irate. He angrily hits Gohan to the floor, and 
        walks towards him to finish him off. He notices the tail, and is ready 
        to pull it off before he sees the moon, when he senses the power that 
        cut off his tail looming behind him.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>35. Vegeta vs. Yajirobe</p>
      <p>Vegeta turns to see Yajirobe cowering, and makes him pay for cutting 
        off his tail. Vegeta beats the fat man across the floor, hitting him into 
        the side of a rocky cliff face, and making him become submerged with rock. 
        He then suddenly remembers about Gohan, as Goku tells him to look up at 
        the moon.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>36. Oozaru Gohan vs. Vegeta</p>
      <p>Gohan looks up at the moon, and Vegeta is too late to pull his tail off. 
        He transforms, and beats the Saiyan up a little, although he can't quite 
        finish him off. Vegeta managed to throw a cutting disc similar to Krillen's 
        at Gohan's tail, cutting it clean off. Gohan falls to the floor, landing 
        on top of the Saiyan prince. He transforms back to his normal state, his 
        tail now permanently gone, and Vegeta defeated. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>37. Krillen vs. Vegeta</p>
      <p>This isn't really a fight, as no punches are thrown, but Krillen hovers 
        over Vegeta with Yajirobe's sword in hand, ready to finish the Saiyan 
        off for good. Goku tells him to spare him though, and Krillen does so 
        obediently, allowing the beaten Vegeta to escape from Earth.</p>
      <p> </p>
