                   ----------------------------------

Dragonball Z RPG is one of the most popular Super Nintendo games ever created.
It never made it to the United States commercially, but people have imported it
and its popularity has grown. The game is based on the anime series Dragonball
Z which has been an enormous hit in the States, and has introduced millions of
new anime fans that otherwise would have never seen it. The series is also a
manga, or a Japanese comic book, and is still pretty popular in Japan. The game
itself is based on the Z series (there is also GT). It takes you through the
entire story from the first fight with Radditz, all the way through the epic
battle SS Goku has with the tyrant Frieza. The game is not a graphical
masterpiece but it is one of the most fun games I have ever played. The text is
in Japanese, but if you play with it for a while, you will be able to figure
out what they mean, and I will try to help a little with that in this guide. -

=====================================================================
\General Stuff/
 -------------

HP - This is like your health meter, except it is a number. The higher this
number, the more hits you can take from an enemy. Each opposing moves, when it
hits you takes away a certain number of HP points. The stronger your character
the less damage he takes.
-------
BP - This is your fighting power. Commonly referred to as your power level.
Again the higher the better. The higher this number is, the less damage you
take when you get hit. Training can increase this power, as well as destroying
a boss in the game. Level ups are increases in this BP.
--------
Ki Blast - This is like a fireball or a beam, generally anything that they
shoot. Most of the time they gather energy and let it rip. These moves can be
very damaging, but can also miss completely. Ki is measured by the number of Ki
you have, which is also increased by training.
--------
Item Cards - These cards are used to regain health and obtain objects. Some are
given to you for certain boss's like the moon tail card, and others are just
general cards like a Bulma. These cards can come in very handy.
---------
File Saving - Always save your game at a point where if you die, you wont have
to start completely over. Every time you defeat a boss, save that to another
file, so then if something happens you will have a back up file.
================================================================================
 \Playable Characters/
  -------------------

- Here is a list of your playable characters, and their backgrounds. Note, some
characters are only available in certain parts of the game. Such as Yajirobe
and the two Namekians who are only available when your on Namek for a certain
period of time. * Important *: Super Saiyajin Goku (SS) is only available at
the end of the game when you fight with Frieza, so don't mis interpret and
think he can be accessed from the beginning in that form (SS).

                      Through the entire Dragonball Z Series - More to come.

Goku:
=====
Goku or Kakarot comes from the planet Vegita. It was home to all of the
Saiyajins, until it was destroyed by Freeza. Goku was lucky he was away from
the planet when it was destroyed so he was not killed. The Saiyajins were
planet conquerer's so they had sent baby Kakarot (Goku) to earth, so when he
grew up he could destroy the planet and have it ready for them to sell. But
when Goku got earth, he was still only a baby, although he had incredible
powers for someone his size. He was taken in by an old man he came to call
Grandpa Gohan. At first he was a very mean little boy, because he had the
Saiyajin instinct to fight and destroy. But one day he was misbehaving and fell
off a mountain and hit his head. Grandpa Gohan took care of him, and then when
he awoke he was a very nice and gentle boy, but this possessing his massive
powers. He was trained by Master Roshi, a perverted but lovable old martial
artist. Back in his day he was the world martial arts tournament champion. He
trained Goku and his best friend Krillin. Goku paid him, but Krillin had no
money, so he was trained for an XXX Magazine. Goku and Krillin competed in lots
of tournaments and were always trying to out do the other as children, and soon
Goku's long rivalry with Picollo Diamoho began. In the Tenachi Budokai
tournament, Goku defeated Picollo Diamoho by flying through his stomach, but as
he was dying he spit out an egg which had his son Picollo in it. Then Picollo
and Goku had battles and battles because Picollo was born hating Goku. Then
later when they were all grown up, and Radditz came to earth to find Kakarot to
find out why he hadn't conquered earth, the first person he met was Picollo.
Picollo was no match for Radditz, but he was left unarmed. Radditz then went to
find Goku and he did at the Kame House with Bulma, Master Roshi, Krillin and
his son Gohan. When Goku would not come with Radditz to join he and the other
few remaining Saiyajins he took Gohan hostage. Then Picollo came to the Kame
House and he and Goku agreed to become temporary allies to kill Radditz. Goku
got a hold of Radditz's tale after Gohan distracted him which allowed Picollo
to use the Mankanpousukko, which ended up killing Radditz, but also sacrificing
Goku. When Goku died he was smiling because he knew his sacrifice had rid
Radditz's evil from the world. This touched Picollo, and he then no longer
wanted to kill Goku, because he basically did, and didn't like the feeling of
it to much. He then took Gohan to train him for when the other 2 Saiyajins
arrived that Radditz told him about as he was dying. After Goku died, he went
into the next Dimension, but Kame then had him go to Snake Road, so he could be
trained by the great King Kai. It took 3 months for him to get there, and he
had a couple detours on the way, but when he did, King Kai was surprised with
his raw talent. He was taught the art of Kao Ken by King Kai, which is a large
amount of energy going through your body for a short period of time. But it
must be worked up to, or your body will explode. Goku left King Kai's planet
stronger than King Kai, and stringer than he had ever been before. When he
returned to earth, he arrived in time to aid some of his friends in the fight
against Napa and Vegita. He easily disposed of Napa, so Vegita decided Napa was
to weak and killed him. Then the fight started with Goku and Vegita. Goku tried
to get as far away from the city as possible so he took Vegita to a very remote
canyon area to fight. They started out with Vegita thinking that Goku was no
match for him, but he would later find that the kind hearted Saiyajin was
stronger than everyone had once thought. So Vegita decided to use an artificial
full moon, which Goku's father Bartok, a brilliant Saiyajin scientist had
invented. It allowed Vegita to transform into his Oozaru form or a Giant Ape.
Goku was totally out matched, so his friends stepped in a little. When Goku was
down, Yajirobe of all people saved Goku by stabbing Vegita with his sword. But
then when Vegita was not dead, Goku had to use the Genki Dama or Spirit Bomb.
But he missed, and it was bumped back at Vegita by Gohan but to no avail. Then
Krillin was given some energy and taught how to do it, so then he hit Vegita
with one, and when he could have killed Vegita Goku made him spare his life.
Then Goku was sent to the hospital to heal, but there was still a big problem.
A lot of his friends were killed in the battle, and since he was unable to
travel Krillin, Gohan and Bulma went to Namek to get there Dragonballs to wish
them all back. This would be the beginning of the biggest journey and one of
the most epic any of them had ever embarked on. When Goku finally escaped from
the hospital, he went and got a ship from the Capsule Corp. He then started on
his journey to Namek. He was caught in an electrical storm, and it messed his
gravity machine up, so he was stuck in 100g gravity. He learned to train in
this surrounding and it made him extremely stronger. Once he got to Namek, he
found Gohan and Krillin barely hanging on against the Ginyu squad, with Vegita
in fair health. He gave them sensu beansand took care of the rest of the force.
Then once Goku finally returns from space, he comes to find a mysterious boy
named Trunks has come from the future to give him heart medicene that he later
need to keep him from dying. While he was there, Trunks took the liberty of
killing Frieza and King Cold, along with all of their soldiers. Trunks and Goku
are the only 2 Super Saiyajins at this point, and it is said that he is much
stronger than Goku, but I guess I'll find out as the series continues.


Gohan:
======
Gohan is the son of Goku and Chi Chi, he is a Saiyajin half breed. This does
give him the lucky advantage of being able to turn into a super Saiyajin, and
he also has the brain capacity of a human, something his father didn't quite
have all of. He does turn out to have the most potential, just to bad he never
really uses all of his power, but he does turn out to be a very crucial part of
the Z Fighters. He is constantly being hounded by his mother to study, and it
usually interferes with his training. He is a pretty cool guy, and he is the
acclaimed cell killer. Basically, Cell was making some choice comments about
his father Goku and how he killed him, and well, he went a little to far, as
you know Gohan does have a Saiyajin temper, and he went of on cell with a crazy
huge Kamehameha. He is generally mild tempered, but he has gone off on
othersfor doing the same thing, such as his tutor, Mr. Shoe. He was ready to
beat the**** out of him for badmouthing Goku, but luckily Chi Chi stepped in
and so hedidn't have to, cause she did for him! He is also the great Saiya-man
because he wanted to use his powers to be a super hero, but he looks pretty
goofy, sohe really ends up just being Gohan in a green outfit with a mask, oh
well. Well I guess that's about it for Gohan, as the Android saga continues on
TV, I'll keep this section updated as best I can!


Vegita:
=======
We first meet the warrior Vegita, when he and Napa, arrive on earth to try to
conquer it, after they heard about the death of Radditz. At first Vegita was
very arrogant, thinking he was much stronger than any of the earthlings could
ever dream of being. Then Goku shows up and things changed a little bit. When
Goku told Vegita he was trained in the art of Kao ken, Vegita and Napa were not
all together pleased. But none the less Vegita was still fearless to fight him.
Goku didn't want the people in nearby cities to be harmed so he led Vegita
faraway out into a valley where nothing would reach them. So the battle
begins,and at first Vegita was stronger than Goku, but then when he started
using Kaoken, and evened it up, Vegita got mad. So he decided to try to destroy
the entire earth, by using his ultra powerful Gammit Gun, but much to his
surprise Goku was able to block and over power the attack by using Kao ken.But,
he knew that was not the end of Vegita, so when he came back Goku was all tired
out from the Kao ken, which exerts a huge amount of power for a shorter amount
of time. So then Vegita created an artificial moon to turn Gohan into his
Oozaru (monkey) form, and then he figured he would just kill of Goku and the
others as long as the fake moon was there. But, then when Goku got him to stop,
and they were all exhausted, Vegita was about to kill Gohan, when Yajirobe of
all people jumped out and stabbed him with his sword.This did not kill Vegita,
but it did hurt him enough to make him realize he could not defeat the earths
forces. Krillin had a chance to kill Vegita as he was trying to get back to his
ship, but he did not at the wishes of Goku. Then Vegita flew off, and was not
seen again by Goku and the others until they arrived on Namek, where Vegita was
there trying to find the Dragonballs so he could kill Frieza and Goku. Vegita
has always hated Goku because he is theprince of all saiyajins, and goku is
only a 3rd class saiyajin, and Vegita could not beat him. Vegita played a huge
role in the fighting with the Ginyu Sqaud, and is responsible for the deaths of
Jace and Guildo. Then when the fight with Frieza came, they would have all died
had it not been for him. Vegita had Krillin come very close to killing him, and
then Dende heal him, so he became a whole lot stronger. Then he fought more
with Frieza, but he and Picollo were still unable to defeat Frieza, then Goku
showed up and Vegita did a rare thing, he spilled his heart out to Goku, and
seemed to have changed. Vegita is the father of Trunks, although at first when
Frieza dn King Cold show back up, he does not know it, but he would find out 3
years later in the fight with the Androids. Bulma and Vegita are kind of a
shaky couple, as Trunks say sit was more of a passion thing. But, in the fight
with the Android Vegita did play a major role, although Picollo could have done
pretty good by himself. Vegita turned into a Super Saiyajin when he was
training on another planet andhe was so mad that he could not beat Goku, and
how he was the prince of allsaiyajins and could not be a super saiyajin, his
rage allowed him to have the emotion needed to turn into a super saiyajin. He
then easily defeats the two supposed Androids which turn out to be fake ones,
but he is also there for the fight with the real ones. But Goku is there as
well, so he has a little bit of help.


Tien:
=====
Tien is a human with a third eye. He is always with chaizo. When chaizo is
killed he launches a huge attack and almost kills Napa, the saiyajin. Tien has
the ability to split into Four illusions of himself and they all shoot a beam.
Tien is a very close friend of Chaozu, Im not sure why, maybe he is his
bodyguard, I don't know, Tien never really gets all that strong until very late
in the story, and by then all the Saiyajins have rediculous powers so it
doesn't matter. Tien was in the mountains with Chaozu when they sinced the two
enormous powers coming towards earth, and immediately prepared himself to do
battle to defend the earth, his home now. Tien is very serious, much in the
same manner as picollo, but Tien doesn't mind having a little fun every once in
a while.


Chaozu:
=======
Chaizo is that little guy that looks like a doll. He has no real moves and is
pretty worthless. All he does is drain energy. He also gets killed trying to
destroy Napa by self destructing on his shoulder. The blast barely scratched
Napa. He is the emperor of something, and he never really amounts to much. He
was with Tien in the mountains when they sinced the 2 huge power levels
approaching the earth and though is puny, he of course also goes with the rest
of the Z-Fighters to help fight against Freeza and King Cold.


Yamcha:
=======
Yamcha is a Goku look alike. He was with Bulma, until his death in the fight
against Napa and Vegeta. He has a scar over his eye and is very arrogant, even
though he is pretty weak compared to the saiyajins. He is also a baseball
player when he isnt training or fighting, and it seems he likes using his
fighting strengths to play baseball, mostly in hitting HR's. He went to King
Kai's to train after being killed, jut took him a little longer to get there
than Goku. In the Garlic Jr. Saga, he turns into a black water mist evil guy,
so he was of no use to the ones fighting Garlic. He was with Bulma when Vegeta
arrives there from space, and like a fool tries to pick a fight, luckily Bulma
was there to keep things peaceful. Yamcha is very jealous of the feelings Bulma
has for Vegeta, and is constantly bad mouthing him, not a good idea for someone
as weak as he is though. He also goes to meet Freeza and his father in battle.


Kulilan:
========
Krillin is an earthling. He was trained by Master Roushi in exchange for an xxx
Magazine. His inner power was later unlocked by Guru. Krillin , Gohan and Dende
are  responsible for Piccolo being wished back to earth. He really didn't
anything to the Ginew Team, and even after Guru he is still pretty weak. In the
battle with Freeza he is killed, atleast he was the cause of Goku going SS. In
the Garlic Jr. Saga, Krillin plays a major role, as he is one of the only 3
fighters there, and without Goku, they need all the help they can get. He
leaves the shield produced by Gohan to try to give him time to destroy the
Mackiel star which was responsible for supplying all of Garlic Jr.'s power. He
has been a pretty big help throughout all of the series, and eventually has
relations with one of the Androids. He is also Goku's best friend in the world.
After he and Maron broke up, he became extremely serious with his training, and
has most likely become a little stronger than before. He is still no where near
Freeza and Goku, but he wants to be ready for anything so he can help Goku when
he returns back home to earth. In the battle with the Androids, Krillin misses
some of the action when he has to take Yamcha back to get a sensu bean, but he
soon rejoins the others to join the fight. The destructo disk is his main move,
besides the Kamehameha, and it cuts through anything, even mountains.


Nail:
=====
He is a Namek. He combines with Piccolo on Namek. He stalls Freeza so Dende can
get the Password to the Dragonballs. He is 95%identical to Piccolo. The
strongest of all Nameks besides Picollo, with a power of over 40,000 he tries
to hold off Freeza so Dende could prevail, which he was beat within an inch of
his life, then he merged with Picollo and they battled Freeza together. Nail
was also Guru's most loyal and trusted guard, as he was the only one to be
completely trained in the art of fighting. He can boost his power up over
200,000 which was quite a surprise to Frieza, but not nearly enough.

Picollo:
========
Piccolo is a Namek. His father spit out his egg right before he was killed a
fight. This is why Piccolo has never been to his home planet. At first
he is a bad guy but now he is a Z Fighter. He is the one who hold of Freeza
long enough for Goku to get up his Spirit bomb attack. Piccolo does not show
his emotions. He is also the one that delivered the death blow to Raditz. He
has the ability to regenerate his body parts if they are destroyed. He saves
Gohan in the battle with Napa and Vegeta. When he goes to King Kai's he refused
to
train with the others but managed to get wished back by Gohan. Piccolo is a
never say die fighter, which got him killed. Overall he is a good fighter.
After he was severly hurt in the fight on Namek with Frieza, and then healed by
Dende, he was back to training. When he feels Freeza's power level approaching
earth, he has quite the little anger problem, destroying a group of mountains,
and of course he is on his way to the battle ground along with the other
Z-Warriors.

Tsmuri:
=======
Namekian Warrior.

Mai-ma:
=======
Namekian Warrior.

Yajirobe:
=========
This is the martial arts warrior who eats a lot. He was trained by Kame with
The other earths final forces, except he doesn't show up until the end. He
Cut off vegeta's tail, and saved Gohan's life, He too, like Satan has a
Habbit of taking Goku's credit. Although in the end he does end up being
Pretty powerful.

Dende:
======
Dende is a Namek child who joins up with Gohan and Krillin after they save his
life from Dodoria and Frieza's henchman. He has the power to heal so he becomes
a big asset to the Z Warriors in their fight again Frieza.
================================================================================
 \Enemy Analysis/
  --------------

Radditz:
=======
Brother of Goku, helped Napa and Vegeta conquer planets. He is also the
Son of Bartok. He was killed when he fought Goku and Piccolo. He warned them of
the two Saiyajins on their way to earth.


Napa:
=====
He was Vegeta best friend until Vegeta killed him because he said he was to
weak. He helped Vegeta in the battle against earths final forces. He Is the
really big bald headed guy that destroys the air force.


Zarbon:
=======
Freeza's first henchman, he has the ability to transform onto a stronger
monster. He is killed by Vegeta on Namek. He was present when
Freeza destroyed planet Vegeta and killed Vegeta's father.


Freeza:
=======
Only second to SS Goku. He has 4 stages each more powerful than the next. He is
killed be Goku on Namek. His father is King Cold.  Freeza Is very arrogant and
uses his tail to gain an advantage. But he was no match for the Super Saiyajin.
After his death, parts of his body were combined with mechanical machines to
make him the perfect fighter basically. He was put back together by the men
that worked for him when he died. Now he and his father are coming to take
their revenge on Goku and the earth. He is much stronger now, but no match
for... who's that? Trunks......


Ginew Force:
============
Jace,Recoome,Burte,Guildo and Cpt. Ginew form the Ginew force. They are
Like Freeza's little special task force. Each extremely powerful, but
They were easily defeated by Vegeta and SS Goku.


=======================
 W A L K T H R O U G H
=======================

-------------------
Battle With Radditz
-------------------

Radditz
Power Level - 1,200
Health Level - 200
Ki Level - 32

  To defeat Radditz, first you have to get both Goku and Picollo's power
Levels up to level 4, at least. Once you have the appropriate power level
Go fing Mr. Popo's house, there will be 5 saibamen inside, once you have
Defeated them he will talk to you and then give you the Gohan card. Now go
Back to the cave entrance(if you've seen it already), and enter. Make your
Way up through the cave until you see Radditz blocking your way to an exit.
This Radditz isn't that hard, just use a couple Ki shots and bass cards.
Once you have defeated him go outside, and there he is again. When you begin
The fight, before you choose your attacks, use the Gohan card, and then have
Both of your fighters use normal attacks only. After they have both attacked
Gohan will fly out and hit Radditz. Now on the next attack, it should say
That Goku is going after his tail so you don't have to pick an attack for him.
As for Picollo, he is going to do the Mankanpasouka, his most powerful Ki
Attack which will kill Goku and Radditz. Once this is done, Picollo and Gohan
Meet everyone in a valley and then Picollo flies off with Gohan to train.

---------------------
Training with Picollo
---------------------

  When training with Picollo, all Gohan has to do is defeat picollo and he's
done, easy right? NO, Picollo's power went way up after the Radditz battle.
Luckily so did Gohans. To beat Picollo, you are going to have to do a good
portion of it at once. So if you have a Ki attack, do Gohans 15 point attack.
It is his Kamehameha. If this hits Picollo, it will so pretty good damage.
Now you are just going to have to duke it out with him, and hope that you win.

----------------------
Training with King Kai
----------------------

  The screen with cut to a shot off Goku running down snake way. When he
arrives
At King Kai's go up and talk to him. You will begin your gravity training.
The object is to beat Bubbles using certain numbers of cards. Each time you do
This you will get a load of experience points. Keep going and talking to King
Kai and you will keep training. Then eventually when you go up to him, you
Will have to fight him. He has taught you the art of Kao ken, so this isn't
Really a very hard fight. Use decnt attacks and maybe a Ki blast, his powers
Only like 3,000. Then you will be wished back to earth by Shenlon the earth
Dragon. Now the screen will go back to Picollo, you and Gohan must quickly fly
Around and find:
- Tienshinan (Tien)
- Kulilan
- Yamcha
- Chaozu
 Once you have found all of them, which if you didn't do quickly they will
Go and get slaughtered by Napa. So, now that you have found them, you may train
a little if you want to, or you can just go right up to them. They are located
beside a cliff toward the right side. Once you have found them they will talk
To you, then you will fight Napa's Saibamen. After defeating them, you will
Fight Napa them mighty Saiyajin himself.

----------------
Battle With Napa
----------------

Napa
Power Level - 5,000
Health Level - 220
Ki Level - 68

 This battle is pretty tough. Use your Ki attacks, preferable Gohans
Kamehameha, but Tien's four man attack is ok to, because the mankanpousuka
doesn't hit very much. Oh by the way did I mention Goku is back! He arrives
right after the Saibamen. You will still need a couple Ki attacks, but with him
here it should be simple. Once you have defeated Napa, he will power up and
shoot a giant fireball out of his mouth at Gohan. Picollo will jump in front of
him, and get killed by the Fireball. Now Goku and Vegeta will fly off to fight.
Remember which way he flew, you will need to know later.

------------------
Battle With Vegita
------------------

Vegita
Power Level - 18,000
Health Level - 240
Ki Level - 100

 Now you will to find Vegita and Goku with Gohan. Once you have found them, you
will be able to help Goku with the rest off your characters. Use Goku's largest
Ki attacks to take out Vegeta. I would not use Gohan's moon tail card unless I
had to, because sometimes when Vegita cuts off his tail it kills him. Once you
have him down really low he will fly off in his spaceship.

---------------
Flying to Namek
---------------

 After you have defeated Vegita and he flies away, you and your still living
characters will go to Namek. Upon arriving there, find Freeza and his henchmen
at the top of the screen, this little slide show will play and then there will
be a mini game. You will have to avoid Dodoria's fireballs until the arrow
timer is full. Once you have escaped from him, you will have a Namek child in
your party. Now find the destroyed Namek village, not the one Freeza was at,
and go to all of te building and check the pots ( search ) here you will find
Dende.
Now you will need to train and train so that you will have enough power to
fight Kui. Once you believe you are strong enough, go into the cave. After you
have got all of the capsule item you will find a Dragonball, when you get out
off the cave, Kui will challenge you to a battle for it.

---------------
Battle With Kui
---------------

Kiu
Power Level - 19,000
Health Level - 220
Ki Level - 100

 This is a pretty tough fight, because you can not use the Vegeta card. Just
duke it out with him until he is low enough to hit with a Ki shot, use Gohans
Kamehameha. When you defeat Kui, your powers all go up after you get his
experience points. Now that you have defeated Kui, and everyone has leveled up
there power, you get called back to the ship by Bulma, when you arrive Dodoria
will destroy the ship, and you will be forced to do battle with him.

-------------------
Battle With Dodoria
-------------------

Dodoria
Power Level - 22,000
Health Level - 288
Ki Level - 120

 Dodoria is a lot harder harder than Kui, but you have leveled up as well.
Use your strongest Ki attacks, and hope they head butt him a lot. Use base
cards with the stronger fighters because they inflict more damage. Once you
have defeated Dodoria, Bulma thanks you and then you all leave. Plus, you will
get a load of experience points, and everyone will level up again.

----------------------
Goku Training in Space
----------------------

 This is really easy. All you have to do is go up the ladder and then go up to
the box and talk to it. You willl do Gravity G training. Just use your highest
card and you will almost always win. You level up after every training session.
Keep doing this until the screen cuts back to Picollo at King Kai's planet.

----------------------------
Picollo Trains with King Kai
----------------------------

 Picollo does the same training with Bubbles that Goku had. Except to finish
his training, instead of beating King Kai, he must beat Radditz and Napa
together. This really is not that hard, just use all of your highest attacks.
Once you have defeated them the screen will cut to Vegeta confronting Zarbon.

---------------
Exploring Namek
---------------

 The other players now must look for the Dragonballs, one of them is in the
middle of a hill. ( use the radar ). Once you have found this, you will need to
fing the other one. At the top of the map there is a cave, go inside and get
all the capsule items. Then go into the pools and talk to the fairies on both
sides of the the cave. After you go to the left fairie she will tell you to
pull all of the switches ( those little holes ). Now leave this cave and go to
the other one below it and hit all of the switches. Now go back to the left
Fairie and she will unlock the wall for you. Go through until you find Dodoria,
defeat him and he will move out of your way. Before you can do this you must
find Nail. He is in a little room. Defeat his friend and he will join your
party. Keep going until you fing Guru in a clearing. Once you are in Guru's
walk into the circle of pots and you will go up to him. He will unlock your
hidden powers within you.
Now leave the place and go back through the cave to the original entrance and
exit. Vegeta will join your party, and you will fight Zarbon.

------------------
Battle With Zarbon
------------------

Zarbon
Power Level - 23,000
Health Level - 232
Ki Level - 160

 This guy is pretty easy with Vegita on your side, just beat him up until he
transforms into his second state. Don't worry Vegita is still stronger. If you
can hit him with Gohan's Kamehameha, Vegita will then do a Ki and head butt him
and kill him. Now your powers are going to level way up again. Now you will
train some more with Goku, and then the Ginyu squad arrives.

---------------------------
Battle With The Ginyu Force
---------------------------

Recoome
Power Level - 65,000
Health Level - 365
Ki Level - 200

Guildo
Power Level - 12,000
Health Level - 296
Ki Level - 270

 First you will have to fight these two Ginyu's. Kill of Guildo quickly, as
this isn't very hard, Vegeta is much stronger. Fighting Recoome is a different
story. Use all of your Ki cards with your most powerful players, if you have
enough, even have Vegeta use one, sometime he will use it. If he does, do his
Gammit gun. Then just beat up on him till he dies. You will get a serious level
up after beating these two.

Jace
Power Level - 65,000
Health Level - 322
Ki Level - 230

Burte
Power Level - 62,000
Health Level - 305
Ki Level - 200

 These two are next, except you only have to kill one of them. Try to kill Jac
so you won't have to later, but it really doesn't matter. Once you kill one of
them, the other will fly off to get Ginyu himself. Train a lot before you go
and find Ginyu, so then you can level up again.

-------------------------
Battle With Captain Ginyu
-------------------------

Captain Ginyu
Power Level - 120,000
Health Level - 396
Ki Level - 300

 This is not a hard battle by any means compared to Freeza. Use Vegeta's Gammit
Gun to take out the remaining Ginyu member, Burter or Jace. Then use Goku's
spirit bomb on Kao ken mode, to make the Captain do his body switch. Once he
does the switch his power is only 33,000. Use the Gammit Gun and Gohan's
Kamehameha to kill him. Then they will take Goku to Freeza's ship to heal.
Train a lot more before you go find Freeza at Guru's house.

-----------------------------
Battle With Frieza The Tyrant
-----------------------------

Freeza - Form 1
Power Level - 500,000
Health Level - 500
Ki Level - 360

 This guy is really hard, so I really can't help you a lot here. But I can tell
you to use the Saiyajin level up trick. If Freeza gets your HP down to 1-10,
use a card that completely restores your health, you will level up. Other wise
you are just going to have to slug it out with him until Picollo gets there.

Form 2
Power Level - 1,000,000
Health Level - 520
Ki Level - 360

 Yes he's stronger, but Picollo is here to help you now. He and Vegeta should
now be able to take Freeza, it won't be easy, but you should be able to. Use
Gammit Guns and Mankanpasouko's to destroy Freeza form 2. Once you defeat form
2, he disappears and it sends you to where you fought the Ginyu force. Maima
and Tsmuri are there. Talk to them, and then train a lot. You will need a lot
of muscle to take Freeza form 3.

Form 3
Power Level - 1,555,000
Health Level - 500
Ki Level - 400

 Freeza is now aware of your extreme powers, so he brought some henchman along
with him. There are 3 groups, once you defeat them you fight Freeza himself.
These guys shouldn't be a problem for Vegeta and Picollo. Now on to Freeza,
Every so often he will leave the battle and you have to find him. Every so
often your training pop ups will be him. This is good, it gives you a chance to
train between turns. Once he is low on HP he will transform to stage 4.

Form 4
Power Level - 3,555,555
Health Level - 510
Ki Level - 420

 Finally Goku is back! Plus we have another little trick for you. There are two
ways to do this trick. One, you can go with the story and have Kulilin Die. Or
you can feel bad for him like me and let Tien or another weak character die if
they are still alive. Either way, it can't be Vegeta, Gohan or Picollo. When
one of these smaller guys die, Goku will turn into a Super Saiyajin, gold hair
and all. Now he defeat Freeza, because he is stronger than him.

If Vegita did not die, and you beat Frieza stage 4, you get the surprise
ending. Vegita has become a SS as well and wants a piece of you. But if you
choose to let him die it doesn't matter.


Battle With Super Saiyajin Vegita " Prince Of All Saiyajins."


  Wow, this guy is pretty stinking tough. I hope you saved your Guru card,
cause you are going to need that and about three Karins. He will do the exact
same move as you, but do double the damage some tomes, that is why he is so
hard. He doesn't usually do Ki attacks, atleast ones you can't dodge. To beat
him you are going to have the cards that I already listed. Beat him until you
get down to about 375, then use a complete healing card. If you have a King
Yama card, use it on a Ki attack and do a Kamehameha. Goku should be the only
one fighting, all the others will be killed in one hit. Once you get him down
to half his power, you should have only used 2 of the complete healing cards.
Save you Ki until he is at half power, and then it is good if you have another
king yama. But if not, save before you verify it, so you can go back if it
misses. Once it hits, just use the other heal card, and enjoy the surprise
ending.

----Various Items (Cannot Sell)----

Name            -          Effect

Dragon Radar    -          Used to locate the Dragon Balls on Earth
                           and, later, Namek.  Once used, you can
                           press the A button to zoom out a bit, then
                           again, then again.  Pressing it again will
                           take it back down to it's original scope.
Crying Gohan    -          Used in the fight against Raditz.  After

                           flies out, and bashes Raditz in the chest.
Namekian Toad   -          This is NOT used in the fight against Ginyuu.
                           For some odd reason, you only use this to get
                           the Yajirobee card back on Earth, prior to
                           the fight against Nappa and Vegita.
Dragon Balls    -          Collect these on Namek to call Porunga, the
                           Namekian Dragon, to grant your wishes.

----Unknown Items----

Name            -          Rumored Effect

???????         -          Ok, here's what you do to see what this is.
                           When you first touch down on Namek, fight
                           until one of the enemies gives you a
                           scouter.  Now, go fight Kewie, with the
                           scouter on, so you get to see what his
                           Power Rating is.  Then immediately use the
                           Vegita card.  Vegita will come in, then it
                           will give you the option to use some odd
                           looking card.  It's all messed up, and
                           green.  And when you use it on someone,
                           their life drops to 0.  What's the point of
                           this item!  Someone tell me so I know it
                           isn't just a fluke in my game!


----In Depth Look at Items and their Uses----

Here are a more in depth look at items, the characters they are associated
with, and what they do.

----Restoration Items----

Bulma:  Woman with purple-ish hair and a yellow shirt/jacket.  Bulma is/was the
first woman ever seen in Dragon Ball, and the second person seen overall.  This
item will restore up to 25 lost hit points.  Very nice in the first couple of
chapters of the game, but a tad outdated by the time you reach Namek.

Kamesennin:  Old, Bald man wearing sunglasses.  This item will restore up to 50
lost hit points.  Better than a Bulma card, and slightly more useful.  You
might actually want to keep these around when you hit Namek.

Kami-Sama:  Wrinkly Green man with antenna.  This man is God himself
(literally), and restores ALL your lost hit points.  They can be used to give
Gohan, Gokuu, or Vegita a level-up (if their life it below 5).  They're fairly
cheap, too, which makes them absolutely indespensable.  Always make sure you
have at least 1 with you.

Puar/Pool:  Odd looking blue-ish cat with a bluish-white face and no nose.
Puar/Pool (could be translated either way) restores 10 Ki points.  These are
relatively common to win from battles, so you're bound to have some handy.
Sadly, you don't use your Ki attacks very often, so these aren't as useful as
you might think.

Mr. Popo:  Stark-black man with no nose, red lips, and a turban.  Mr. Popo is
God's right-hand man.  His item will completely restore your Ki points.  Very
nice indeed, especially for the Vegita fight (Gokuu using a Genki Dama costs
quite a bit).

Senpyou:  A blue cat with a nose (his eyes are closed) and a staff.  Senpyou is
the cat at the top of Karin Tower, and the holder of the Senzu seeds.  That's
what this item is, actually.  Senzu seeds are the magical food items that
completely restore your hit points AND ki points.  VERY nice.

ShenLong:  A large Dragon.  Shen Long (Jackie Chan's name in Chinese) is the
dragon called up when all 7 dragon balls are gathered.  Shen Long, in this
game, completely restores ALL characters' hit points and Ki.  VERY expensive,
but also VERY nice to have for the Freeza fight.


----Card Changing Items----

Enma-Daiou:  Large Pink-ish man with a horned hat and a beard.  Enma-Daiou, the
gatekeeper of Heaven and Hell, is a VERY large man who maxes out one card's
attack rating, making it a "Z" card.  This is a nice card, but it's not the
greatest card out there.

Uranai Baba:  Old woman with a witch-like hat.  Baba is Kamesennin's slightly
younger sister, and the item that bears her face makes one card's defensive
rating a Z, or max.  This is better than the Enma-Daiou card, because while you
can attack first and attack hard with Enma-Daiou, with this card, you might
just survive long enough to attack again.

Son Gokuu:  Adult man with wild, black hair.  You should know who Gokuu is if
you're playing the game, right?  This is an awesome item, because it makes the
card you use it on have a max (Z) offensive rating, a max (Z) defensive rating,
and allows the character that uses it attack every enemy in the group.  In
other words, you have the highest defense, highest offense, and if there are 5
enemies you are fighting, instead of just hitting one of them, you'll attack
all of them.  Very nice to have, but a tad costly.

Piccolo:  Green man with a turban.  Ah, the Devil himself.  When Kami (God)
became God, he had to exsponge all the evil from his body.  All that evil
became Piccolo Daimou.  Son Gokuu, as a child, defeated that incarnation, but
before he died, Piccolo Daimou created 1 final offspring, which is this present
Piccolo.  You should know what Piccolo looks like, though, because he is one of
the two characters you start with.  His item allows you to change one opponents
attack and defense to 1 (the lowest possible), and changes the card style to a
different one (if it was that person's style of attack, then it would change it
so they would not be able to attack everyone).

Kame:  A brownish turtle with it's mouth open.  Kame, Kamesennin's sometimes
friend, changes ALL of your cards' offensive and defensive ratings.  This can
be a blessing and a curse, but I usually prefer not to risk it.

Chi Chi:  A woman with long, black hair.  This card is VERY nice to have, since
you pick which card you want to use it on (i.e., a VERY strong card can become
a Ki card, if you choose).

Oolong:  Funny looking pig.  Ah, Oolong.  This item, along with Bulma and
Puar/Pool, are THE most common items.  The Oolong card changes ALL your cards
to a completely new set of cards.  That means new styles, new offensive, and
new defensive cards.  These are surprisingly effective when you're fighting
some of the later battles (and you have absolutely NO good cards).


----Character-Effect Items----

Lunch/Kushami:  A Yellow haired, severely P.O.ed-looking woman.  Kushami is a
beautiful, innocent young girl with blue hair (not Bulma, though, because Bulma
is FAR from innocent).  Unfortunately, whenever Kushami sneezes, she turns into
the golden-haired woman, Lunch.  Lunch is BEYOND violent, and ALWAYS seems to
have a weapon at hand.  Her(their?) item allows whatever character you use it
on to attack every enemy in the group for 1 round.  This is a VERY effective
card, since it allows the character to use even Ki attacks on everything, with
the cost of only 1 use.  Which means that TenShinHan is the ultimate warrior,
since his 12 eyes technique cannot be dodged.

King Kaioh:  A blue catfish-like man sporting sunglasses.  King Kaioh is the
ruler of the small planetoid at the end of Snake Road.  His item, whomever you
use it on, raises their Battle Rating by 25%.  This is a VERY nice card to
have, since before/during the Vegita & Nappa fight, they are fairly common to
win from battles.

Saichourou:  Gigantic, wrinkly green man.  You'll see a Kami item WAY before
you ever see one of these, and besides, this man is easily 3 times the size of
Kami.  Saichourou is the Namekian elder, and his card is easily one of the best
in the game to have.  It raises your power rating by 1/2.  Wow.  That means
that even if you've only got a power rating of 416, you power will jump to 624.
 Geez, that's a lot.


----Various Items (Cannot Sell)----

Dragon Radar:  Looks like a large watch, except instead of a watch face, it has
a digital readout with a green grid and (hopefully!) green lights signifying
Dragon Balls.  This is used to find the location of the Dragon Balls.  After
you use it, by pressing the A button again, it will increase the readout
radius.  You can do this two more times, but pressing it a fourth time will
shrink it back to the original size.  You exit the readout by pressing the B
button.

Gohan:  Small, crying child with a yellow and green shirt.  This item is
required to beat the game.  You get it by travelling to Mr. Popo's house on the
eastern side of the main continent.  Defeat the 4 Gold Sfuru-Jin, and you have
the item.  The Gohan item is used against Raditz.  Simply use it during the
battle, and at the end of the next round, Gohan will slam Raditz, stunning him.
 At this point, Gokuu can now grab Raditz and hold him long enough for Piccolo
to kill him.

Namekian Toad:  Yes, folks, this does exist!  That's right, you can get it
during the fight against Vegita on Earth.  All you have to do is purchase a
Lunch card, then visit Yajirobee.  He'll tell you that Oolong is looking for
some hentai pictures, so go visit Oolong and talk to him a couple of times.
He'll take the Lunch card (that pervert!), and give you the Namekian Toad.
Sadly, though, this item isn't used against Ginyuu at all.  After gaining it,
you are to take it to Yajirobee, who then...gulp...eats it.  Awfully hungry,
wasn't he?  After eating it, you'll get a Yajirobee card, which I suggest you
hold on to, in case Vegita decides to turn into an Ooarzu...

Dragon Balls:  One of seven yellow orbs, each with a different number of stars
in the center (1-7).  The Dragon Balls are collected to summon Porunga on
Namek.  The location of these can be found using the Dragon Radar.  And since
Gohan has a Dragon Ball on his hat at the beginning of the game, that means you
should easily be able to find him...

----Various Items (Can Sell)----

Green Scouter:  A Saiya-Jin piece of machinery.  They are all white, with a
green screen that flips over the eye, which projects the readouts.  These are
used to determine the power rating, Hit points, and Ki of the enemies you are
fighting.  Unfortunately, they have their limits.  Once used, they only detect
the next 3 fights before quitting, and if they try to register someone with a
power rating over 23,999, then it'll explode.  This causes you to lose it.
Sorry...

Red Scouter:  Looks like a Green Scouter, but with a red readout screen.  This
is just the same as the Green Scouter, except these also read the attack cards
of your opponents, it will last for 5 fights, and it can't read over a 199,999
power rating without exploding.  Sorry...

Grandpa Gohan:  An old man with a white beard and a cap.  Not to be confused
with Child Gohan or Kamesennin (another Gohan, another old man with a white
beard), this card stuns the enemy you use it on.  Sometimes, it remains
effective for more than 1 round of fighting, while others snap right out of it
and attack.  It's all random, but you're guaranteed a round of fighting with
it.

Bubbles:  A brown monkey.  Bubbles, King Kaioh's pet/friend, certainly is an
odd character.  His item allows you to fly or walk for a period of time without
being attacked.  Very nice during the Vegita fight, since you have a certain
amount of time to find them in between rounds.

Yajirobee:  A fat man with shaggy, long black hair.  Yajirobee's item only
appears twice in the game (as far as I know), and isn't near as useful as it
was in DBZ 1 for the Famicom.  His item summons Yajirobee, who attacks the
target of your choice.  He's not that strong, either.

Vegita:  Man with wild black hair and a LARGE widow's peak.  Vegita (my
favorite character) has a rather interesting item.  You earn it from him after
you beat him on Earth.  His item allows you to call him into a battle, where he
will fight alongside you.  He will stay for the entire round, but is
uncontrollable.  At least he won't attack you...

Buuku Juitsu:  A shot of someone (Gokuu?  Piccolo?  Vegita?) flying along with
a large Ki field around them.  This card has 2 uses.  The first is rather
pointless: where ever you are on the overworld map, if you use this, it will
take you to the nearest Healing place (Bulma's house, etc).  If you are in a
cave, then this will allow you to transport out of the cave, returning you to
the cave entrance.  It's good to have for the latter, but not the former.

Moon/Tail:  A shot of the moon/a Saiya-Jin's tail.  This card is given to you
after you defeat Nappa.  Once you've used this card, Gohan turns into an Ooarzu
(or as some people like to call it, a "Giant Ape").  Once he has done this, his
power is multiplied by 10, making him a match for Vegita.  The only problem
with this card is, you get it after defeating Nappa, and if you didn't use it,
you lose it after defeating Vegita!

Porunga:  A large, greenish-monster lookin' thing.  This item can only be used
in battle, but grants you 3 wishes to be used at any time (you don't have to
use them all at once):
1)  It halves the life of all the enemies in the battle,
2)  It restores the life of all the characters alive in the battle, and
3)  It gives all the characters in the battle a level up (except
    enemies).
Ok, folks, here's how you get it: When Nail fights Freeza, hold out as long as
you can.  If you can actually do damage to Freeza, then when you summon
Porunga, you'll get one of 2 choices: a Porunga card, or a Moon/Tail card.
Either one is nice to have; on the one hand, you get that final level up for
everyone easily, while on the other hand you have an awesome fighter in the way
of Gohan for the final battle!
