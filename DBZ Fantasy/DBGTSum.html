            <p>Dragon Ball GT closes the popular series in Dragon Ball with an 
              introduction to another set of dragon balls and the reintroduction 
              of Emperor Pilaf. Dragon Ball GT, short for Dragon Ball Grand Tour, 
              first aired in Japan on January 7, 1996. Akira Toriyama, the creator 
              of the Dragon Ball series, did not lead in the production of this 
              series. It is believed that the only reason for the creation of 
              GT was so that people would still be interested when the new Dragon 
              Ball Video game &#147;Dragon Ball: Final Bout&#148; was released.<br>
              Since the success Dragon Ball, new producers lead in the productions 
              of GT without Akira Toriyama heading in the productions. The first 
              few episodes were not popular with the viewers for the lack of action 
              and story line, interest picked up as the Z warriors traveled across 
              the galaxy.Tens years has passed since the end of the Dragon Ball 
              Z<br>
              series. Goten, Gohan, and Trunks are grown up living outtheir daily 
              lives in the big city.</p>
            <p> Gohan is married to Videl, Mr. Satan&#146;s daughter, and have<br>
              a daughter of their own, Pan. Goku is training with Uubu as Mr. 
              Popo and Dende watches nervously as Goku and Uubu are causing tremendous 
              damage to the tower. After stopping for a few minutes, Goku walks 
              around the tower to notice Emperor Pilaf has grabbed the Ultimate 
              Dragon Balls that was in an urn and has called the dragon. TheUltimate 
              Dragon Balls, also known as the Black Star Dragon Ball, was created 
              by Kami-sama before he was purified.<br>
              Emperor Pilaf is outraged to see how big Goku has gotten and believes 
              that he is here to stop him from making his wish again. Pilaf orders 
              Shuu and Mai to shoot the robot missiles, which was easily caught 
              by Goku. Pilaf, blinded by his rage insanely wishes that Goku was 
              smaller so he would be easier to defeat. The dragon says &#147;So 
              be it&#148; turning Goku into a child again. After the wish is granted, 
              the Dragon Balls are scattered across the universe. Dende and Mr. 
              Popo are confused as they come across a child Goku.<br>
              Kaiou-sama mentions the only way to reverse the wish is to gather 
              the Ultimate Dragon Balls, and to keep the world from blowing up.</p>
            <p> Goku meets up with all his friends back at his house, which makes 
              Chi Chi mad since she thinks this is a rude trick on her since Goku 
              looks much younger then her. As the Z team fixes up the Space ship 
              that Bulma has built, Pan is mad that she cannot go with Goku to 
              help him out to find the balls. She kicks the ship putting a dent 
              in it but covers it up with a cart. She flies off with Goku following 
              closely behind her but escapes him when two thugs kidnap Goku. The 
              two thugs tries all day to call in their ransom, but gets no luck. 
              They are later scared off when Goku brings them a<br>
              phone booth when they are looking for one. The next day, Goku and 
              Trunks climb aboard the space ship as Goten finishes up his phone 
              call out side the ship. Pan waits for Goku and Trunks to enter the 
              ship so she can blast off<br>
              with out getting kicked off the ship. This begins Goku and his team 
              search for the Ultimate dragon balls. Goku and the team travel across 
              the galaxy coming across many enemies and making friends on his 
              search of the seven Ultimate Dragon Balls. One of the friends they 
              make is a little robot they later name Gill. Gill ate the trio&#146;s 
              dragon radar for energy and Trunks told it to come with them since 
              it will act as a large dragon radar. It helps them have an advance 
              warning of up coming dangers and adds a comic<br>
              effect to the story. The trio arrives home with all seven Ultimate 
              Dragon Balls in their possession, happy to be home with their love 
              ones. Goku gives Dende the Ultimate Dragon Balls so he can make 
              the wish to save the<br>
              world but Dende has a smirk on his face. Little does Goku know that 
              the whole world is not feeling it self lately.</p>
            <p>Baby, an enemy Goku and his friends come across in the galaxy has 
              made his way to earth, planted eggs inside all the people on Earth 
              to become his slave. Goku, unable to contain SSJ3 form long in his 
              child form looses the<br>
              first battle with Baby. He goes under training to learn to hold 
              this form longer then has been able to. After his training is completed, 
              he is teleported to the new planet Plant that Baby has created to 
              look like the old planet Plant. Goku and Baby Vegita fight with 
              Goku loosing. Goku is outraged that he can not save planet Earth 
              that he transforms into a Golden Oozaru and starts trashing the 
              planet. Pan flies in front of Goku in his transformed state and 
              begs for him to stop, crying his finger. Goku looks up at the Earth 
              again and a golden yellow glow engulfs his body as lightning shoots 
              across the sky. The cliff Goku was on crumbles underneath Goku&#146;s 
              feet and when the dust rests, Goku has transformed into his SSJ4 
              self. Goku looks like his adult for with long black hair, and an 
              ape like body with dust red coat. Pan wishes for Goku to stop Baby 
              Vegita, and Goku mentions he should have the power to stop him. 
              Goku and Baby Vegita fight with Baby Vegita about to loose until 
              Bulma steps in to save her husband by transforming him into the 
              Golden Oozaru. Baby goes crazy in this new form destroying his own 
              city and planet. Kaiou-bit, one of Goku&#146;s training partner, 
              teleports to Dende&#146;s Palace to get some water that will cure 
              all evil in someone. He then teleports back to planet Plant to transform 
              all of Baby&#146;s slaves back to their normal self. SSJ4 Goku finally 
              defeats Baby when Baby tries to escape in a space ship which Goku 
              destroys with a Kamehame-ha blast. The whole world is turned back 
              to normal when Kaiou-bit sprinkles the water on the Earth removing 
              the Baby&#146;s egg and control over them. The Planet Earth is about 
              to blow up, leaving SSJ4 Goku and Kaiou-bit teleporting people and 
              animals to the planet Plant. They are able to get everyone to the 
              planet when Goku realizes there is one last person on the<br>
              planet. Piccolo contacts Gohan to let him know that he is going 
              to stay on the planet when it blows up and die so the Ultimate Dragon 
              Balls can never be used again. As long as Piccolo is alive, anyone 
              can use those dragon balls. Piccolo also tells Gohan how proud he 
              is of him by how strong Gohan has got. He wishes him goodbye as 
              the planet blows up. After Dende&#146;s dragon balls are able to 
              be used again, Dende wishes the Earth to be restored and all the 
              people back to the Earth. The next fighting tournament begins with 
              Goku in the kids competition and Pan in the Adults. Goku is defeated 
              when the kid accidentally bumps into him when he was talking to 
              Goku, then tickled to where he falls out of boundaries. Pan, having 
              more luck then Goku defeats her opponents with little problems. 
              She then pulls herself out of the competition when an announcer 
              asks her how she would feel taking over her father&#146;s position. 
              With fear of herself looking like Mr. Satan, she pulls herself out 
              of the competition. The final round is between Uubu and Mr. Satan. 
              Uubu is about to finish Mr. Satan off when he realizes that Mr. 
              Satan is the Earth&#146;s hero and if he defeats him, all the world 
              will look down on Mr. Satan. Uubu lets Mr. Satan punch him out of 
              the ring so Mr. Satan will win the competition and the audience 
              applause. Mr. Satan is awarded the strongest person on the Earth 
              once again.Dr. Gero and another evil scientist in the home for the 
              internal losers combine powers to create the ultimate warrior to 
              get their revenge on Goku for defeating them. They create another 
              #17 so the two can merge togetherto become Super 17. Goku goes and 
              fights Cell and Freeza, who both think they have gotten strong enough 
              to defeat Goku. Both are defeated by Goku with little problem. Goku 
              comments on this mentioning how quickly this fight when. On Earth, 
              #17 kills both Kurrinin and #18 when #18 would not join him in conquering 
              the world like they were supposed. #18 crawls to her dead husband 
              and holds his hand as she dies in the street with him. The two #17 
              merges together to become Super 17 which both Vegita and Gohan cannot 
              stop. Goku wishes to go back to Earth, but is not able to return 
              for some reason. Goku finally returns to Earth, saying he was able 
              to since the food<br>
              tasted so bad down there. Goku then fights 17 until he kills Him 
              with the Kamehame-ha blast that pierces 17&#146;s chest. Once the 
              fight is over, the Z team gathers the dragon balls to wish all those 
              killed by 17 back to life. The dragon balls did not work like they 
              usually do, as they are cracked and<br>
              blue smoke pours out of the dragon balls.</p>
            <p>Another dragon comes out of the dragon balls, and tells the people 
              he doesn&#146;t care about the wishes and creates 7 dragons, each 
              with a dragon ball. Kaiou-bit mentions to everyone that the reason 
              behind this is that each time<br>
              they make a wish, evil is brought into the ball and causes the ball 
              to crack like it did today. Kaiou-bit mentions if Bulma never did 
              create the dragon radar, this would have never happened but Bulma 
              says that she couldn&#146;t do it<br>
              all on her own, Goku helped her. Goku, thinking that he had a part 
              on this, tells them that he has to do what he has to do. Goku takes 
              off after each of the dragon to defeat them. Goku flies across the 
              world defeating each<br>
              dragon as he goes along. Vegita, still disappointed that he is not 
              able to turn SSJ4, has Bulma build a device that will be able to 
              turn him into a SSJ4 just like Goku. Goku, coming a long the last 
              dragon, Li-Shenlon who absorbed all the dragon balls to become perfect.</p>
            <p> Goku, unable to defeat Li-Shenlon on his home sees Vegita coming 
              and wonders what he is doing here. Bulma fires a ray at Vegita that 
              transforms Vegita into a SSJ4. Goku and Vegita uses the Fusion technique 
              to turn into Gojiita SSJ4 that is the ultimate fighter in the series. 
              Gojitta can only stay in this form for twenty minutes when it turns 
              back into both<br>
              Vegita and Goku. This has been the longest anyone has been able 
              to last against Gojiita when it is perfect. Li-Shenlon destroys 
              Goku, Vegita, and their friends. Pan and the rest of people watching 
              are told to leave for their own safety. Goku, back as a kid again, 
              powers up for his Spirit Bomb attack. He asks all the characters 
              that he had met on the search for the dragon balls to help him to 
              defeat this dragon before it destroys the whole galaxy. Goku gets 
              the energy needed to complete the Spirit Bomb and destroys the Evil 
              Dragon. With that, the dragon balls return back to<br>
              normal, Shenlon returns and mentions there will be no more wishes 
              for 100 years. Goku makes a deal with the dragon to make one more 
              wish. He wishes for everything to return like it was before the 
              dragons destroyed the Earth in replace for his own life. The dragon 
              grants it and tells Goku to hop onto his back. Goku wishes everyone 
              goodbye as only Vegita and Pan understand what Goku is about to 
              do.</p>
            <p> Goku flies over Tenshinhan and Chauzu, Yamcha fixing his car. 
              He stops by in the Home for the internal losers and thanks Piccolo 
              for everything, and wishes him goodbye with a powerful hand shake. 
              Goku stops by Master Roshi&#146;s island to duel with Kurrinin one 
              last time. After Kurrinin gets one good hit in, Goku vanishes back 
              to Shenlon and falls<br>
              asleep on top of his head. All seven -dragon balls circle around 
              Goku as they get absorbed into his body. The four star ball, believed 
              to have his grand father&#146;s spirit circles Goku&#146;s head 
              and then is absorbed into his forehead.</p>
            <p> 100 years has passed since Goku traded his life for the world&#146;s 
              life. Goku jr. and Vegita jr. are competing in the tournament as 
              Pan, old and full of spirit, watches his grandson battle on. As 
              she looks at the bottom row, Goku is sitting there watching the 
              two fighters battle with all<br>
              their heart. Pan tries to go say hello to her grandfather, but he 
              vanishes before she could get there. As GT closes, you see Goku 
              walking out of the arena as a young adult smiling at what he has 
              seen.</p>
            <p>-------------------</p>
            <p>Another summary on DB GT:</p>
            <p>In Kami's Lookout Gokuh and Ubuu are having a massive battle. It 
              just about destroys the whole floating planet. We see how much stronger 
              Ubuu has become since DBZ. From the side of Kami's Lookout there 
              are three robot's that hole<br>
              people in them. Non other than the great Emperor Pilaf and his two 
              trusty assistants Myuu and Shou. They have come to find that ultimate 
              Dragonballs. We see how much Pilaf has aged since Dragonball. Gokuh 
              and Ubuu come out of<br>
              the battle area to be met by Dende and Mr. PoPo. Gokuh and Ubuu 
              faint from exhaustion. Now, Pilaf finds the Dragonballs and explains 
              to his assistancethat they were made before Piccolo split so these 
              Dragonballs are twice as<br>
              powerful. Ubuu says good-bye to every one and then leaves. Gokuh 
              eats a huge meal and then says farewell to his friends. Pilaf has 
              gathered all the dragonballs together and has summoned Super Shenron. 
              He is s giants red<br>
              Dragon that looks transparent. Gokuh is leaving and runs into Pilaf. 
              Pilaf's assistance knows who he is immediately, but Pilaf is uncertain. 
              Gokuh does not notice the Shenron and implies what Pilaf is doing. 
              When Pilaf finds out<br>
              that this is the same Son Gokuh who has stopped him from ruling 
              the world in the past he goes nuts and fires missiles at Gokuh. 
              Gokuh easily stops them and this gets Pilaf very upset. Pilaf says 
              that he wishes that Gokuh was a kid again so that he could beat 
              him. Well, Shenron takes this wish seriously and turns Gokuh back 
              into a child. Shenron then bids a farewell and the Dragonballs fly 
              off. Kaio, Dende, Popo, and Gokuh are talking and Kaio and Popo 
              reveal that these Dragonballs scatter all over the Universe and 
              not<br>
              just all over the planet. Gokuh though does not seem to mind much 
              and flies away. Kaio utters though that Gokuh does not realize how 
              serious this is.</p>
            <p>We are now taken to a building where men are holding a building 
              hostage. At the same time we see Pan-Chan and her date walking down 
              a road. They are headed to see a movie. When they arrive the learn 
              that the movie theater is<br>
              off limits due to the back robbery. Pan-chan of course being very 
              angry takes off to go fight the bank robbers. She easily defeats 
              them all. During the fight though Gokuh arrived and attempted to 
              fight, but each time got stopped by Pan because she thought he was 
              just a little kid. Well, after the<br>
              fight Pan's date runs away in fear and she begins to cry. Just then 
              Master Roshi shows up and at the same time Pan and Gokuh utter his 
              name. Well, as Kamesennin walks over he has to be his normal self 
              and walk through the crowd of all the pretty girls and touch every 
              single one of them. Gokuh<br>
              finds this funny, but Pan is very embarrassed. Gokuh utters that 
              he never changes and Kamesennin wonders who this kid is. When Gokuh 
              tells him it doesn't sink in right away, but after a moment Kamesennin 
              grabs Gokuh and hugs him and twirls him around. Pan is amazed and 
              will not believe that this is her grandpa. She is in shock when 
              Gokuh realizes who she is.</p>
            <p> Back at Gokuh's house Videl, Gohan, Chi Chi, Pan, and Gokuh have 
              joined. Chi Chi feels that it is a conspiracy against her because 
              Gokuh already lives longer than her and now he has to go and turn 
              into a little kid. Gohan asks Gokuh if he will search for the dragonballs 
              and Gokuh is uncertain. Kaio then calls for Gokuh and tells him 
              that if within one year all the black star dragonballs are not gathered 
              that Earth will blow up.</p>
            <p> Trunks is just returning from a meeting and is being greeted by 
              all of his employes. They are congratulating him and telling him 
              of all his other meetings. Every single girl who works there is 
              staring at Trunks and comenting about what a hunk he is. Trunks 
              doesn't look very happy though and<br>
              when he gets to the elevator he tells everyone to leave him alone 
              for a while. When he gets in him office he sits down to rest when 
              a man carrying a stack of books comes in. He asks Trunks to look 
              over them and leaves before<br>
              Trunks can really get in a form of response. Then Trunks secratary 
              comes and reads Trunks schedule for the day. Trunks stands up and 
              has an evelish look on his face. He opens the window and flies out 
              it. Trunks flies over thetown and off into the distance.</p>
            <p> Back at Gokuh's house Goten is talking to his new girlfriend when 
              we see Chi Chi, Gokuh, Gohan, and Videl talking. Chi Chi is relieved 
              that Gokuh will be able to leave the next day. Gokuh doesn't want 
              to go, but of course Chi Chi takes charge and tells him he has to. 
              He suggests that all they have<br>
              to do is to get the regular DB and move everyone to a new planet. 
              Videl jumps in though and asks for that to be a last resort and 
              everyone agrees. Gohan then mentions that he will be going also 
              and Pan wants to go then, but is told no. Videl and Gokuh then bicker. 
              A little later everyone is working on the space ship. We are told 
              by Bulma that it is just a 3 person ship. Outside of Capsule Corp. 
              there is a man spying on the door to CC. Out walks Vegeta who looks 
              very different then in DBZ. We learn that they are looking for Pan. 
              Meanwhile, Pan is trying to find someone to help, but no one needs 
              it. She gets upset and kicks one of the walls. Well when she does 
              this she puts a dent in the ship and knocks an engine loose. She 
              quickly puts something in front of the dent. Pan is bored so she 
              leaves the building and<br>
              the man who was looking for her goes to get her. Gokuh comes running 
              after pan because he wants to go with her. More than once Pan says 
              no. The man hides in some bushes right in front of Pan and Gokuh. 
              The man jumps out to<br>
              get Pan just as she flies away so instead he grabs Gokuh. Pan goes 
              to see her Grandpa Satan and when she gets there to take out her 
              anger takes on all of the men in his martial arts class. After beating 
              them all she challenges Satan, but Satan weasel's out by saying 
              he has a cold. Then men have now taken Gokuh to eat while two of 
              the men discuss who this kid is. They come to the conclusion that 
              he is an illegitament child. They phone Bulma, but she takes it 
              as though Gokuh is lost. Now Pan and Mr. Satan are discussing how 
              everyone treats Videl like a child. They are at a restaurant and 
              when the waitress brings them there drink we see that Videl has 
              ordered coffee and Mr. Satan has ordered some sort of shake. Mr. 
              Satan then gets Pan all<br>
              riled up. Meanwhile, Gokuh has taken one of the men to an amusement 
              park.During this the other man calls CC again only to get Vegeta 
              on the line. Vegeta tells the guy to do whatever he wants with Gokuh 
              and then hangs up. The two men and Gokuh are driving when Gokuh 
              says that he should get home. The man though says that he wants 
              to make one more phone call. When they cannot find a phone Gokuh 
              flies away to get one. He comes back carrying a pay phone and the 
              two men come to the conclusion that Gokuh is a monster. They then 
              hop into their car and drive away.</p>
            <p> Back at the CC we see Trunks fly out of his window, but he stops 
              because he sees Vegeta. Vegeta then gets together Trunks and Goten 
              and tells them that they are going with Gokuh to find the DB. He 
              says that he asked Gohan to<br>
              switch with them. He also tells Goten to forget about his date and 
              tells Trunks that Bulma can take care of the company. Gokuh, Trunks, 
              and Goten<br>
              stand in front of the ship while Bulma, Gohan, Vegeta, Bra, Chi 
              Chi, and Videl look on. Videl wonders where Pan is. Right as they 
              are about to get on the ship Goten's phone rings and it is his girlfriend. 
              He tries to explain why he canceled their date while Trunks and 
              Gokuh board the ship. The two go up to the ship second level only 
              to find Pan in the control room. With Goten still outside Pan pressed 
              the ignition button and the spaceship takes off.<br>
              Goten is sent flying through the air and then tells his date that 
              it looks like they are still on for the night. As the ship flies 
              out of view a part flies off the ship and lands next to Bulma. Bulma 
              has a look of shock on her face and then looks of in the distance 
              at the ship.</p>
            <p> On the space ship Trunks is chasing Pan around for the control 
              panel key. Pan points out that he she knows he wants it so that 
              he could turn around the ship. After much chasing Trunks finally 
              catches Pan. Pan though drops<br>
              the key down her shirt so that Trunks cannot get to it. Back on 
              Earth Chi Chi is wondering about how Gokuh and Pan are doing. At 
              the same time Bulma is trying to find where the part that feel of 
              the ship came from. On the ship Pan is cleaning and talking about 
              how everyone has to chip in. At the end of her talk the ship starts 
              to shake. The group looks out the window only to see one of the 
              engine's falling off. Back on Earth Bulma has found that the part 
              was part of the main control rocket. Trunks takes command of the 
              ship though and flies towards the closest planet. Trunks manages 
              to pull of a semi clean landing. Next, Trunks, Gokuh, and Pan are 
              walking through a town. We learn that the planet is called Imegga. 
              There is a massive market and Trunks and Gokuh decide that they 
              will rest for the day and fix the<br>
              ship the next day. After they say this a mob of people charge after 
              them and dress them in close. Everyone is trying to sell them something. 
              When Trunks mention's that they need a part for there ship everyone 
              tries to sell them<br>
              one. Trunks finally buys what he needs and then they are off to 
              a hotel. They three of them sneak into a hotel not sure what to 
              expect. They are met by the desk clerk. Trunks asks if there is 
              a room available. Trunks then mentions about how he was forced to 
              buy more than he wanted. The clerk then talked to him about the 
              merchants and said that he would not find such vendors in his hotel. 
              So Trunks, Pan, and Gokuh are brought up to their room. It is a 
              gigantic room that could fit many more than three. Trunks<br>
              jumps onto the bed, Pan goes to take a shower and of course Gokuh 
              goes to eat. Trunks turns on the TV and he sees the countries leader 
              Don Kea. He wonders if the country is lead by a dictator. pan then 
              comes out to tell<br>
              Trunks that t he water will not turn off. Trunks jumps out of the 
              bed, but is attached to a chain. Then Pan and Trunks notice that 
              Meters are attached to everything. The refrigerator that Gokuh has 
              opened is filling up the room<br>
              with food and will not stop. The meters are charging them for everything 
              that they use. Quickly Trunks grabs Pan and Gokuh and they fly out 
              of the hotel.</p>
            <p> It is night time and the three of them are standing outside. It 
              is raining and Gokuh and Pan are fighting. They all decide to go 
              back to the ship, Pan though leans against a wall and she falls 
              into a house. They are met by two parents and their two children. 
              We find out that the ruler is Don Kea. He is a very greedy king. 
              Everything that everyone has is leased from the king and that is 
              why people need to make money so they can pay the lease. Prices 
              though are very high. During the talk though robots come along and 
              take the people's house because they were not able to pay the rent. 
              We also learn<br>
              that things were not like this before Don Kea and any threat or 
              attack made against him will result in severe punishment. The next 
              day Trunks, Pan, and Gokuh are walking back to their ship. Pan wonders 
              if there is a DB on the planet and Gokuh also urges Trunks to check 
              the dragon radar. As Trunks pulls it out he is startled by a noise 
              and drops the radar. A little robot who is half buried in the ground 
              eats the radar to replenish its energy. Trunks grabs the radar, 
              but then the three of them see their space ship being pulled away. 
              The robot gets away and Trunks and Pan chase it. Finally Gokuh chases 
              it, but by the time he is caught their ship has already been taken.</p>
            <p>Trunks, Gokuh, and Pan are still out in the desert. Gokuh suggest 
              that he can catch up to their ship by using teleportation. So Gokuh, 
              Pan, and Trunks go up onto of a cliff and Gokuh finds the ship. 
              When Gokuh teleports though<br>
              he is just brought about 20 feet above the rock and then they fall 
              to the ground. This happens one more time. Trunks than points out 
              that the reason is because the DB's brought Gokuh back before he 
              mastered teleportation. Back at Don Kea's palace he is eating when 
              his two assistants Velajin and Ziguel. They report to Don Kea that 
              they recovered the ship he spotted a few days earlier. They go on 
              to say that there is nothing of value on board and that it is virtually 
              useless. Don Kea then tells them to at least sell it to a scrap 
              yard so that they can make some money off of the ship.</p>
            <p>Gokuh, Pan, and Trunks have followed the ship and are at Don Kea's 
              palace. They sneak in and are discussing where the ship would be. 
              Gokuh spots the ship and three fly down to get a closer look. The 
              Z gang walk all around the<br>
              ship and guards are everywhere. Finally they get close enough and 
              Pan decides that it is time to get the ship. As she is running though 
              a can tossed by one of the guards hits Pan on the head and causes 
              here to cry. Trunks grabs Pan and covers her mouth. When Pan finally 
              stops though a big<br>
              rock falls on Trunks's head knocking him over. When he falls the 
              robot in his backpack wakes up and starts talking. The guards here 
              and go to get the intruders. The three of them easily beat up on 
              all the guards. Gokuh cuts loose the ship and it lands in the back 
              of a hover craft. Pan drives the<br>
              craft while Gokuh and Trunks are on top. Pan knocks into everything 
              and everyone is running away. Velajin and Ziguel each fire a ki 
              blast at the ship which Gokuh easily knocks away. The blast goes 
              flying after it hits the two and a mysterious person at the top 
              of the building easily knocks it<br>
              away. He then wonders whether Gokuh is a Saiya-Jin. Back at Don 
              Kea's palace Don Kea talks to Velajin and Ziguel and asks why he 
              pays them so much. They then tell Don Kea that they have pictures 
              of the intruders. We also learn<br>
              that they man who knocked away Gokuh's blast is named Professor 
              Ledgic and it seems as though Don Kea fears him. Trunks tries to 
              fix the ship, but he needs to buy some parts. So the three Saiya-Jin 
              go into town to get the<br>
              parts. When the people see them they all close up their shops and 
              run away. Pan, Gokuh, and Trunks then see wanted signs of them all 
              over the town, but the pictures have been altered to show them with 
              guns, knifes, and making<br>
              obscene gestures. The police then chase after the three Saiya-Jin.</p>
            <p>More to come...</p>
