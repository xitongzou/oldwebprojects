<div class="Section1">
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">This fan
  fic is, like so many others, set in an alternate universe. This universe
  consists of the same planets, star systems, etc, but the inhabitants of the
  galaxy vary slightly from the original DBZ series. Vegeta and Goku are both
  saiyans, and Gohan is half saiyan. Both have surpassed every other person in
  their race by becoming super saiyans. The planet Vegeta<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>still remains intact though, as Frieza hasn’t seen the need to
  destroy it yet. The planet Vegeta isn’t called that though, it has had its
  name changed to Planet Saiya.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Frieza has
  the two most powerful henchmen in the world, and an elite squad of fighters.
  The power levels during this fan fic are not the same to the series, and this
  will be stressed time and time again. For instance – Zarbon could be
  stronger than Frieza in this fic, and Chao-zu could be even mightier than them
  both (Don’t worry, that’s not the case). Anyway, I’ve bored you enough
  with this epilogue, enjoy the rest of the fic!</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">************</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
  inhabitants of the Planet Saiya are content with their life. They wander
  around, getting along with their business under the watchful eye of Frieza’s
  guards. They work for him out of fear more than anything else. The conditions
  that they are put in are absurd, as they are forced to live on the dark side
  of the Planet, with Frieza’s soldiers occupying the light side.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
  difference between these two sides are many. The light side is better for
  growing crops, living in, and well, basically everything. The dark side is
  terminally cold, dark, damp and dingy. There is very little food, and the
  quaint amount that can be scavenged is shared sparingly amongst the residents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">The Planet
  Saiya wasn’t always like this. It once was a peaceful planet, where there
  was only a light side. Everything thrived and grew well. Then Frieza came
  along. He sucked the resources out of the planet, and caused this abnormality,
  where one side is in much better condition than the other. He laughed as the
  saiyans cowered in fear at him, and laughed even more when the bravest of the
  warriors had attacked him, as each one of them fell to his hand.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
  saiyans have had enough of being treated like this, and they are all gathered
  inside a hut, of about the approximate size of Frieza’s ship. This is where
  our story begins…..</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Three
  saiyans sit at a desk, one is an old man, with graying hair, another is a
  slightly younger one, but a lot smaller too, probably below average height,
  with long flowing hair down to his ankles. The third saiyan is a huge,
  muscular man, bigger than anyone else. He seems to intimidate the weaker of
  the species, but earns respect from the braver ones. On his arm are scratches
  with tally marks on, and initials all over. These are the names and numbers of
  all the people that he has killed in his lifetime. He is the most violent
  saiyan ever, and seems to be the leader of this pack. His name is Otoku. He
  slams his fist down on the table, snapping it in half. The benevolent chatting
  comes to a halt, and all eyes gaze upwards at the towering figure.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“This
  meeting was called to discuss what we do to Frieza…” Otoku started. “We
  must stop him now before he gets out of hand. We have already been wiped from
  the good lands onto the wastelands of our own planet, what is to stop him from
  wiping us off it altogether? I say that there is only one course of action,
  and that is war!” He kicks the table away, and raises his arm into the air.
  “Who will fight by my side, who will take on Frieza’s men, who will free
  our people, who will be the savior of our planet!?”. Cheers spread across
  the whole room, as volunteers start to come along thick and fast. A group of
  about 30 saiyans join Otoku, and the remaining saiyans (Mainly women and
  feeble lower class soliders) salute them, and cheer with all their heart.
  Otoku leads the brave volunteers out into the open air, and takes them into a
  small barracks. He stops outside it though, and waits for silence. When he is
  granted it, and begins to speak once more in that voice which is made for
  speeches.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You are
  the bravest warriors on the planet. You are the ones who will take on Frieza
  by my side! You must work hard, as this will be no easy ride! If anyone
  can’t handle it, then drop out now, because any failures will be killed
  outright! Do I make myself clear?” Mumbles scatter around the crowd of the
  now-no-so enthusiastic soldiers as they attempt to answer, and overcome their
  fear. A couple of members from the group slowly back away from the crowd,
  trying to keep a low profile. The group loses only a small portion of its
  numbers, not significant enough to put any sort of ruptue in their plans.
  Otoku is still waiting for an answer, and is about to shout again when a
  young, male saiyan steps forward. He has long spiked hair that sticks up, and
  it is no shorter than a foot high. It sways calmly in the wind. He has a
  confident smirk on his face, and a scar running from his brow, down to his
  eye, and it seems to go right through it, as if it cuts through the actual
  pupil, and then down his cheek, until it is about level with his lips.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Are we
  going to get this done?” the young saiyan asks. “I am Korosu, and Frieza
  has killed my whole family! I have seen how powerful he is, and I know for a
  fact that no one, not even you Otoku, is strong enough to beat this monster.
  After he killed my father, I charged at him, but couldn’t connect with a
  single blow.” His voice is becoming sentimental now, and he is obviously
  trying to hold back the tears as he continues. “He backhanded me away,
  swatted me away, just like a fly. I was no match for him, and I know that your
  power level may be a few thousand more than mine Otoku, but you are still no
  match for him. If we are to defeat this evil monster, then we must train day
  and night, with all we have. We must train until we have power levels of over
  100,000. Only then can we come close to matching his power.”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">The other
  saiyans look at him in despair. Most of them only have a power level of 3,000.
  Korosu himself has a power level of 10,000, as he is well known to be one of
  the best fighters around. Otaku’s true strength has never been revealed, but
  legend has it that he has defeated some of the strongest soldiers in the
  galaxy. Of course, this is just a legend, and may not be true.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Everyone
  cheers, as they head off into the barracks to start their training. Otaoku
  stops Korosu though, and whispers into his ear.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Kid,
  don’t get these guys’ hopes up. I know the fight will be futile, but I
  will fight until death, and if we put our all into it, we may just defeat him.
  You’re right though, even I am a long way off the power required to so much
  as match Frieza. Now come on, we have to train these guys, they’re a sight
  for soar eyes!” The two of them sprint into the building, and incessant
  talking can be heard from the outside, as they discuss training tactics.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Zarbon, an
  upper class soldier, is talking to one of his fellow elites. This elite
  isn’t anyone too special, but he is there to help in case any minor trouble
  breaks out. Zarbon seems to get slightly annoyed at the constant rambling that
  this soldier is emitting, so he holds out his hand, and kills the elite in one
  shot. Zarbon then dusts his hands, and starts walking towards Frieza’s
  quarters to accompany his overlord. He is intercepted on the way though, by an
  eager little boy, only just into his teenage years. The boy has a hearty smile
  on his face, and he looks up at Zarbon with a great degree of respect in his
  eyes.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Master
  Zarbon” the boy started. “I have just got news that the saiyans are
  preparing for rebellion. A group of them have gathered in a barracks on their
  planet. Word has come from the Planet Saiya that their first target will be
  either you or Frieza.”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Zarbon
  smiles at this news, and the smile turns into laughter. The young boy looks on
  with concern, wondering how his master isn’t in the slightest bit worried.
  Zarbon finishes his spell of laughter, then turns to the boy, and puts his
  hand on his shoulder. The little boys concern turns to joy, as his greatest
  hero has touched him.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Tenoki,
  you have been working in my service for a few years now, and you have been a
  good servant. I thank you for the information that you have gathered, but I
  must question you on one thing – From what sources did you scavenge it
  from?”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">The boy
  looks slightly taken back by this comment. “Zarbon, I have never lied to you
  in all the years that I have been in your employment. It is against my better
  judgment to do anything dishonest and wrong. I have been informed by one of
  the soldiers monitoring the planet. I scavenged it off no one, but was told it
  by a high ranked guard.” Zarbon is looking puzzled by this last statement.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“A guard
  told you this vital information?”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Sort
  of”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“What do
  you mean ‘Sort of’?”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I
  overheard him raving about it. He said something like….‘Blasted saiyans!
  It looks as though they’re gathering for a rebellion!’ then I ran straight
  to find you.”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Ok, go
  prepare my battle uniform Tenoki, I may be paying our saiyan friends a little
  visit.” The boy nods, and rushes off in the opposite direction to where
  Zarbon is heading. Zarbon quickens his walking pace, as he knows that this
  information could be extremely important. His cocky stride makes his braid of
  green hair bounce up and down with each step, as his light green skin shines
  in the obscene amount of light that is given off from the powerful lamps on
  the ships walls. Zarbon walks round a corner, and then enters a large room. He
  takes a deep breath, then starts to blurt out the news.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">After
  Zarbon has finished talking, a chair swivels round, letting off a small
  squeak, so that the occupant of it is now facing him. Frieza, the evil tyrant
  gets up out of the chair, and walks towards the see-through glass of his
  living quarters, brushing past his loyal henchman. He gazes outside whilst
  holding a small glass of red wine in his hand, and delicately sipping it
  occasionally. He turns to his minion, Zarbon, and notices that he is shaking.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“What is
  wrong Zarbon? You don’t seem to be your usual self.”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“It’s
  this saiyan rebellion. We all know how powerful they have the potential to
  become, and they may have the power to take me out if I meet a big gang of
  them”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Impossible”
  Frieza insisted. “After all, at the moment, it is only a rumour. I want you
  to go and check it out. Take with you the Ginyu Force. Between you, you are
  the most elite fighters in the world. There is no one who can defeat you, so
  don’t worry. Worry causes failure, and you had better not fail me Zarbon!”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“N…no
  sir. I shall perform the mission to perfection.” Something about his voice
  sounded edgy. Zarbon has beads of sweat dripping down his face. His fists are
  clenched hard, and he nods his head, then turns for the door. “I shall
  prepare for the mission now master Frieza.”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Good, I
  will send you an alert tomorrow, before you leave for the Planet Saiya. Be
  prepared though Zarbon, I don’t want to lose a good soldier to a band of
  unruly monkeys.” Zarbon fakes a small chuckle at this comment, as he walks
  out of the door.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Zarbon is
  furious at Frieza. How dare he push him around like that, and threaten him in
  such a way. Who is he to demand success? What if there are difficulties? What
  if he can’t defeat the saiyans? So what if Frieza regards this saiyans as
  mere monkeys. One of them may even grow strong enough to defeat him, and knock
  him off his throne, halting his reighn of terror. That is a long way off
  though, and until then, there is no point in resisting, or disobeying orders,
  as Frieza is a much tougher prospect that any saiyan could ever be.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Zarbon
  power walks down the corridor, thinking of the mission all the way to his
  quarters. He enters them, and is ready to get a good night’s sleep until he
  is forced to spy on the ‘Unruly monkeys’. He closes the door, and
  doesn’t even bother to change, as he flops onto his soft, comfortable bed,
  with his head filled with constant thinking, and images of Frieza’s wrath.
  The last person to disobey him was tortured in a terrible way, then killed
  mercilessly. That is not the sort of thing that he wants to happen to him.
  Zarbon turns over, then rests his eyes, making a resolution to train harder
  than ever after the mission, in order to become stronger, and to finish his
  mentor – Frieza. That day shall be grand, but first these saiyans must be
  dealt with.</font></span></p>

2 - Arrival</font></span>
</h3>	  
<div class="Section1">
  <div class="Section1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">A small,
 rounded pod comes soaring towards the Planet Saiya, turning into a raging
 ball of flames as it breaks into the atmosphere. It docks down in an
 isolated clearing, with huge impact. A crater about the size of an Oozaru is
 made. After a short pause, there is movement from the pod. The door swings
 open, and a light green hand appears on the side. It thrusts the attachment
 of its body up, and then finishes climbing out of the pod with a small leap.
 The passenger looks around, breathing in the dirty air from the surface of
 the industrial side of the planet. The man is none other than Zarbon. He
 walks slowly out of the crater as 5 pods crash down behind him. He doesn’t
 even hesitate to look round, and sees that they are on his team.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">‘Damn,
 I’m jumpy today! Gotta calm myself down!’ Zarbon thought to himself as
 he finished getting out of the crater that his crash landing had made. He
 bends over, and kneels down. He runs his smooth skin through the dusty
 ground, and his investigation achieves only a clump of eroded dirt. He sighs
 to himself as he gets to his feet, and casually wonders towards the Ginyu
 Force.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
 Ginyu Forces pods are unlike any that Zarbon had ever seen. They had streaks
 of blue down the side, and had the ever-prominent logo engraved onto the
 side. Each one seemed to be tailor-made for each member, with decorations of
 all sorts on. Almost systematically, each one of the pod doors swing open.
 One-by-one, the Force get out, and line up. Zarbon knows what’s coming,
 and gives off a grievous sigh.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">‘Everytime
 they go anywhere, these idiots have to do all that posing. Why can’t they
 just get along with the missions!’ Zarbon contemplated. ‘Must be because
 of some sort of mental deficiency’ he confirmed to himself.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
 elite soldiers of the Ginyu Force started to dance around in that annoying
 pose that they were guaranteed to do wherever they were. After a tedious
 performance, Ginyu proudly leads the troops towards Zarbon. With an arrogant
 grin on his face, Ginyu does a mocking bow. Zarbon is not impressed, and
 kicks the captain in the face, with utmost hatred. Ginyu staggers back, but
 knows not to fight back, as it would be worthless. Zarbon is very close to
 Frieza, and if they were to agitate him, then they could be in big trouble
 with the head honcho.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Zarbon
 turns, flicking his braid of hair into the air, then walks off, with each
 stride more ignorant than the last. He has beads of sweat dripping down his
 face, and his fists are clenched hard.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">‘These
 Ginyu idiots will under estimate those blasted saiyan’ Zarbon interpreted.
 ‘They will be destroyed! Ah well, that’s good for me, at least I won’t
 have to go on any more missions with them’ The changeling smirked at the
 prospect of finally ridding himself of these posing goofs.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">They all
 set off towards their destination - the saiyan camp, with the whole of the
 Ginyu Force lagging behind slightly, so as to not anger Zarbon anymore. He
 sluggishly kicks the ground, and starts to psyche himself up mentally, so
 that he is in the best possible state for what will probably be a huge
 brawl.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">In the
 head barracks, Otaku and Korosu are hard at work training with their maximum
 effort. Sweat pours down both mans face, as they hang from the ceiling,
 doing sit ups. Korosu mentally counts his 10,000th sit up, and assumes that
 he has done enough of them for now. He is suspended in the air by the rope
 attached to his feet. He breathes hard, trying to regain his breath so that
 he can get back to training. Otaku comes up to him to help him down, and
 cuts the rope which he hangs from with a handy pocket knife. Korosu falls to
 the floor, and thanks his elder warrior sarcastically. Saiyans litter the
 area, with their hard working nature, as they become more and more powerful.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Hey
 kid, want to test out that new found strength that you have attained in the
 past few days?” Otaku asked.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yeah,
 ok, me vs. you. I’ll kick you round the floor my friend” taunted Korosu.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Deal
 then. Everyone, stop training immediately!” Shouted Otaku. “Me and
 Korosu are about to show you lot how to fight. One of us is going to be
 beaten to a pulp, and put in the regeneration tank for about half of a
 day.”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“What?!”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Ha,
 don’t worry kid, what doesn’t kill you, only makes you stronger! Now
 let’s begin!”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Otaku
 charges at Korosu, and knees him in the stomach before the rookie gets a
 chance to say anything. Korosu falls to the ground, holding his stomach,
 desperately trying to catch a breath. He begins to cough up blood, and looks
 down to the injury. His armour has been broken off very cleanly. He looks up
 to Otaku pleadingly, and the leader of the rebel forces kicks Korosu in the
 face. He falls back holding his nose as blood gushes from it. His face is a
 bloody mess, and he looks up at his sensei with a look of discretion in his
 eyes. He tries to talk to Otaku, but is unable because of the blood that is
 spilling from his mouth. Otaku grabs Korosu, and slaps him round the face,
 causing more bleeding. Korosu is hanging limply now, as his saiyan master
 holds him high in the air for all to see.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“This
 is an example of an unprepared being. Do you really think that Frieza will
 wait until you are ready before he strikes? He will show no mercy, and tear
 each of you limb from limb! Look at this weakling here! He wasn’t able to
 put his heart into it, because of his emotions. I don’t want any of you to
 feel these emotions, as they will only make you weak! Now, the next training
 exercise is…….” Otaku’s voice trails off as he lets off a loud gasp.
 Korosu’s fist is in his gut. His eyes widen, but his look of excruciating
 pain soon turns into a sly grin, as he grabs the arm of his fellow saiyan
 elite, and chops it with such force that the crack could probably be heard
 from miles away. The scream of pain that followed it was equally as loud,
 piercing the souls of all the frightened saiyans. Korosu falls to the floor,
 holding his arm whilst breathing extremely fast. He doesn’t seem to be
 able to get up now, and Otaku holds out his hand, and starts to build up
 energy in it. Korosu mouths the words ‘Please, stop’ to his master, but
 they are not received. A blast of blue energy goes straight through the
 saiyan soldiers chest, and makes even more blood scatter everywhere,
 plastering the walls, and making everyone wince at the sight. Otaku shouts
 over the disgruntled mumbles so that his voice can be heard.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Get
 him to the regeneration tank….NOW!” He then bends down to Korosu’s
 level, and whispers into his ear. “This will make you stronger, maybe even
 more so than me” He looks up to the cowering saiyans, whom he considered
 to be scum, and shouts at them even louder than before. “Hurry up and get
 this brave warrior to a medical tank! You people make me sick! Now train
 harder!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
 saiyans re-gather their nerve, and efficiently lift Korosu up, and take him
 to the medical lab. He is put into a tank, and left in the hands of doctors.
 Otaku walks up to one of them and gestures him over to the corner, away from
 the crowd.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“He
 will be ok, right? I mean, he’d better not die, because if he does…”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“It’s
 too early to tell. He looks pretty badly hurt, and if he was taken here a
 minute later, then I would guarantee death, but as it is, it is impossible
 to tell. I will keep you posted on anything that happen here, no matter how
 trivial”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Thank
 you doctor” Otaku said as he left for the door. He called for his saiyan
 army, and they all jogged back to the barracks, to continue their training,
 unaware of the evil that has landed on their planet, and is rapidly
 approaching to uncover the conspiracy plot, and to destroy those wretched
 saiyans once and for all!</font></span></p>

</h3>
		  
<div class="Section1">
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Zarbon led
  the Ginyu Force into a somewhat isolated village. People are going about their
  daily business here, buying groceries, chatting about local events, and
  running around, playing abruptedly. This side of the planet is extremely dark,
  and there is very little enjoyment in the smoggy, thick air. Zarbon trembles a
  little, not from the terrible cold, but out of fear. They venture forth into
  the unknown abyss, noticing something very strange about the inhabitants of
  this place. They all have brown, furry tails, which swish up and down, and
  blow in the wind.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“This is
  the place,” Zarbon said. “Look out for any sort of military building”
  The Ginyu Force nodded, and they began to scout the place, desperately hunting
  for their target so they can get this relatively boring mission over and done
  with.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">It takes a
  while, but Zarbon eventually hears grunts from a large building, and decides
  to take a peek inside. He notices all the activity going on, and gestures over
  towards the Ginyu Force with his hand. They silently approach him, and wait
  patiently behind him. Zarbon sees that the activity is that of hard-working
  scum - The saiyans, who are training with great amounts of effort. He bursts
  through the door, and grabs the nearest resident of the barracks.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“What
  the hell are you doing here?” he yelled at the top of his voice. The saiyan
  cowers in fear though, scared of what is to come. Zarbon asks again, but it
  warrants no response. He throws the saiyan through the eastern wall of the
  barracks, and then turns to the watching eyes of the other occupants of this
  building. They all stop what they are doing, and get into their fighting
  stances. Zarbon laughs at them, and waves his arm towards the outside. In
  walks Captain Ginyu, bleeding nose and all, along with the rest of his elite
  fighting squad. “I assume you are the ones that Frieza told me to check
  on,” laughed Zarbon.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Who are
  you?” asked a strong sounding voice. There is no answer, so the voice asks
  again, this time in a much harsher way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“Who
  are you?” The sound is coming from some shadows to the left of the room. The
  figure is only revealing his silhouette, but from it, Zarbon can see that this
  warrior is evidently very strong. The warrior walks out into the light letting
  it illuminate his face. “I am Otaku. Leave now, or we shall be forced to
  eject you from the premises by way of physical violence.”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You
  aren’t scaring anyone, scum. I am Zarbon, elite soldier, and henchman of
  Frieza. These acquaintances of mine are the Ginyu Force, more elite soldiers,
  each with a power level of four times what yours is. If you wish to do battle,
  then we shall. Now step down, and come with us quietly.”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Fuck
  you” Otaku replied.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Have it
  your way,” muttered Zarbon, as he charged in, and buried his fist into
  Otaku’s gut. The huge saiyan goes down to one knee, but doesn’t give up.
  Otaku grabs the arm of Zarbon, and begins to crush it, making some blue blood
  trickle from the wound caused. Screaming out in pain, Zarbon blasted Otaku in
  the face with a small ball of energy. Otaku immediately falls backwards, in a
  crumpled heap.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Anyone
  else wish to oppose us?” Zarbon asked cockily. “I thought not. Now
  everyone line up….DO IT!” The saiyans all stand in a line, waiting to be
  led outside. There is a chain message going along their ranks, as if they are
  planning something.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“NOW!”
  a saiyan elite shouted. All together, they blasted their most powerful beam at
  the Ginyu Force. Zarbon looks on as the whole of the force are obliterated. It
  takes a while for the dust to clear, but when it does, only Captain Ginyu
  emerges from the piles of rubble. He is covered in his own purple blood, and
  is having major trouble standing up. The rest of his men aren’t moving.
  Jeice, Rakoome, Burta, Guldo, not even one of them are showing any signs of
  life.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You
  bastards! I’m not going to let you get away with this!” Ginyu yelled as he
  held his arms above his head. A ball of florescent purple energy is gathering
  in the air, and when it reaches its maximum size (About the height of a
  bookcase) he throws it, maintaining style by posing as the ball leaves his
  hands. The saiyans can only look on in horror as the ball speeds towards them,
  and makes contact, causing mass damage, and an epic explosion.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You
  idiot Ginyu!” shout Zarbon. “Why’d you do that?”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“We were
  going to kill them anyway,” replied the captain quietly.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yes,
  but not here! We were meant to kill them outside to prevent anymore thought of
  rebellion!” shouted Zarbon, somewhat unconvincingly.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Don’t
  worry, everyone would have seen that blast”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I’m
  not surprised, you blew the roof off, quite literally”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yeah,
  it’s not easy being a super soldier” Ginyu chuckled. Zarbon couldn’t
  believe how the saiyans managed to kill four members of his squad. Four of the
  toughest warriors in the galaxy destroyed by some mere monkeys.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Ginyu,
  listen carefully, we must make sure that there are no survivors, because if
  there are then there is no way that Frieza will let us live!”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I know.
  I hope one of these assholes still is alive though, then I can torture him for
  what he and his friends have done to my team!” Ginyu shouted, with clenched
  fists as he wondered around the room, checking pulses. There seemed to be no
  one left alive. Ginyu walked towards the final saiyan, the troublemaker at the
  start of the fight, and checks his pulse. It is beating, beating slowly, but
  it is beating none-the-less. Ginyu lifts Otaku up, and starts to choke him
  against the wall. Zarbon notices this out of the corner of his eye, and sighs.
  ‘Why does this idiot have to pick on the helpless ones? Why can’t he just
  finish up so we can go back’ he thought to himself. Otaku half opens one
  eye, and lets out a blast from the palm of his hand, piercing the armour of
  captain Ginyu, and knocking him down onto the floor. Before he gets a chance
  to take a breath, Otaku has a hole blown through his stomach by a KI blast of
  awesome power. Zarbon stands with his palm held out, with smoke drifting
  skywards from it.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Damn
  saiyan. Ginyu had better not be dead!” Zarbon thought out loud. He runs over
  to the Captain, and raises his head.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Zar….Zarbon…..help
  me quickly…” Ginyu pleaded helplessly. Zarbon lifts him up, puts him on
  his shoulder, and shoots away through the air, dumping Ginyu in the small,
  rounded pod upon his arrival on the landing site. Zarbon keys in some controls
  instantaneously, then slams the door shut. Ginyu’s pod takes off with
  remarkable speed, heading towards the docking ports of Frieza’s ship.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I just
  hope that I have done enough. These blasted saiyan have better not have taken
  away another one of our best men. I may not like him, but he is a great
  fighter, almost as good as me in fact…..why did he have to try to torture
  the last one though, the damned idiot!” Zarbon said to himself, as he
  stepped into his own pod. He closed the door, then started to run his finger
  across the back of the seat, searching for the safety belt. He discovers that
  it has been caught underneath the seat, and with a huge yank, he pulls it out,
  and straps himself in. Zarbon taps in the co-ordinates to which he is heading
  (Frieza’s ship) then sits back, resting, as the pod takes off. He is going
  to have to explain what went wrong to Frieza, and it isn’t going to be
  pretty.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Damn,
  why did Ginyu have to kill those saiyans?” Zarbon asked himself. “I was
  going to side with them against Frieza, but now I have no army, and must wait
  even longer! I must admit that they had astounding power in destroying the
  Ginyu Force, and the one who gave the captain such mortal wounds appeared to
  be very strong too. I must find a new group of super powered beings, otherwise
  there is no hope for the universe, and I may never be able to become ruler in
  Frieza’s throne unless I kill him soon! Time is running out…I must end his
  life, before he ends mine for failing him! He will kill me when he finds out
  that his private army has been destroyed!”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Zarbon
  knows what he must do, as he changes his destination to the planet Earth.
  Maybe he can hide out there for a while, whilst he trains hard, and becomes
  even more powerful than Frieza. He has heard about the powerful warriors that
  reside there, maybe they can help him…he shall have to wait and see…</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Back on
  the Planet Saiya, the regeneration tank gives a little buzz, and the water in
  there begins to drain. Korosu opens his eyes, and they are full of awareness.
  He blasts the glass door open, and walks out, breathing in the stale air. He
  sniffs gallantly for a while, and a look of horror strikes his face. The air
  is stale for a reason.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“The…the
  smell of…of…of death is in the air! The barracks! Otaku! I’m coming
  guys!” Korosu shouted, rather helplessly. He ran straight through the door
  of the medical room, knocking it off its hinges, as he lunges on, rather
  clumsily, attempting to get to his fallen comrades in time. He grabs a scouter
  off one of the village merchants as he sprints down the street. Korosu starts
  to press the button on it, but it doesn’t even blink. Korosu desperately
  tries to make it work, but it remains blank. He takes it off, and crushes it
  in his hands, dropping the devastated remains on the ground.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">‘Whoa, I
  feel way faster now! I feel much stronger too…..how though? I can’t be as
  strong as I think I am can I? If I am right, then I must be as strong as Otaku
  is now! But all that happened after my training was a beating….how could
  that have contributed….no time to think about that,. I must save my
  friends!’ thought Korosu as he continues to run down the street. He
  doesn’t realize what he is going to witness in a few short seconds when he
  enters the barracks. He has no idea of the carnage that awaits him. He is
  hoping that everything is going to be alright, but he realizes that he is only
  trying to fool himself. “EVERYONE HAD BETTER BE OK!” Korosu shouted at the
  top of his voice, as he skidded to a halt outside the barracks, of which the
  walls have been cracked, and blown off in places, and the roof is now
  non-existent. He takes a deep breath, about to step inside to view what has
  happened.</font></span></p><br>

</h3>
		  
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Korosu bursts into the barracks to see a
horrifying sight. Saiyan blood plasters the walls, and a few strings of
intestines are scattered around too. A tear gathers in the eye of this merciless
warrior. He has killed thousands, destroyed countless planets, and never once
thought about how they must have felt. The tear starts to stream slowly down his
cheek, eventually dropping to the ground, making some of the dry blood run a
little. He looks around, desperately trying to find signs of life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“K…Korosu..” a voice trembled.
Coughing is followed afterwards, along with a scream of pain. “Korosu ….
over….. here!” the voice said again, this time with a distinct struggle to
get the words out.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Otaku? Is that you?” Korosu asked.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Yes, it is me. Come quickly…I have
much to explain, but little time left to do it in”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“I have to get you to a regeneration
tank first!” Korosu blurted out.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“No time….there is no saving
me….but I must tell you something of utmost importance. We were attacked, betrayed
by warriors of….of…”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Come on, tell me damnit!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Of…Frieza” Otaku finally managed
to say. “They destroyed all of our men easily, and one of them killed me.
Avenge our deaths Korosu. You have the potential to be stronger than anyone else
in the universe. You must hire mercenaries to help you with your conquest. Go to
the planet Earth if you must, as rumour has it that there are some
unceremoniously strong soldiers there. Saiyans, like us, but the next level, the
super saiyans”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“S…S…Super saiyans? I thought that
was only a legend?!” Korosu exclaimed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“You will not know until you
investigate the matter. Go, now! I don’t want you to see me like this any
longer!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“I will not leave you Otaku!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Then out me out of my suffering. I
cannot survive much longer. Kill me now”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“B…but….I can’t. You’re like a
father to me!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Where’s your saiyan pride! I can
say…ARRRRGH…quickly, put an old man out of his misery. If you don’t, then
I will be damned to suffer this excruciating pain! I have got the death that I
wanted – Died on the battlefield, protecting my race. Now do it! Kill me!”
Otaku shouted.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“I will avenge you my friend” Korosu
said sadly, as he held his hand to Otaku’s face, then launched a huge KI blast
at his friend, killing him outright. Korosu doesn’t even turn round to see the
carnage that has been put to Otaku’s body. If he would have, he would have
seen that even before he had blasted him, Otaku had a hole about the size of a
basketball ripped open in his stomach, and was lying in a pool of his own, vile
blood. He would have also noticed that Otaku was in an insanely intense amount
of pain because of the hole in his mid-section. But Korosu saw only a blurred
face, because his eyes were swelled up with tears. Korosu stops before he walks
out of the building, and lets off a scream of aggravation. “You bastards!
I’m going to get you for this!” Everyone looks at him, but he just stomps
right past them, with a mean look of contempt on his face, ready to commit some
scum to their death.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">***</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ginyu’s pod crash-lands on Frieza’s
ships docking ports. All the mechanics and workers there gaze towards the
flaming wreck, and quickly run over to it, to help whomever the passenger may
be, to a medical bay. Fire extinguishers are bought onto the scene, and the
inferno slowly calms down into a few small sparks, then into nothing at all. The
pod door is flung open, and out staggers Captain Ginyu, bleeding from the waist,
and covering the floor in acidic blood. He falls to one knee, holding his gut in
agony. Ginyu begs for help, and someone grabs his arm, and lifts him onto their
muscular shoulder. He blacks out before he sees who it is.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When Ginyu regains consciousness, he is
in a majestic room, with a beautiful view from out of the ports window. A
familiar clink fills the room, as a figure puts down a glass.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Captain Ginyu” the figure started.
“It has come to my attention that you failed your mission on the Planet Saiya.
Not only that, but you failed miserably”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Frieza? Is that you?” Ginyu asked
as the figure stepped out of the shadows. It was, in fact, Frieza, but he
didn’t look like his usual self. Gone was the elegant glass of red wine, and
the slight grin to accompany everything he says. He is looking considerably more
intimidating since Ginyu last saw him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“You failed me Ginyu. One of my best
soldiers, failing against a few monkeys!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“We…we destroyed them all sir”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“At the loss of your whole force
captain. It seems that without your force, then you are of no use to me. Now
tell me where Zarbon is, and I’ll consider letting you live, and allow you to
work for me as a lowly janitor.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Zarbon? I haven’t seen him since he
carried….we walked off from the Planet after completing our mission. Sir, I
must thank you for allowing me to recover before we had this meeting”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“Stop the small talk Ginyu. Seeing how
you and Zarbon lost so many of my men on that mission, I think that I will
destroy both of you, but seeing how Zarbon isn’t here, it looks like I will
have to find, and torture him at a later date. Until then though, it looks like
I can have some fun with you!” Frieza laughed, with his aggressive side not
only showing more than before, but burning brightly, describing his violent
mannerisms, and showing why he is the most feared warrior in the universe.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“But sir!” Ginyu protested, but to
no avail. Frieza has already made up his mind. He walks towards the Captain,
laughing manically, as he begins to charge a ball of energy up on the tip of his
finger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“Please sir, stop!”
Ginyu pleaded, but again, it had no affect on the hard posterior of the evil
tyrant. “You leave me no choice sir. Change now!” Ginyu yelled at the top of
his voice. His mind and body separated, but instead of hitting Frieza, he is met
with an energy blast, that is sent straight into his mouth. Ginyu is blown
backwards, across the room, only coming to a halt when Frieza appears behind
him, and catches him. A loud crack echoes around the room, signaling that Ginyu
has had his back broken. The captain of a once, thriving, prosperous, elite and
undefeatable fighting force lays on the floor, unable to move a muscle.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">“You really didn’t think that I
would let you switch bodies with me did you Ginyu? I have known you for such a
long time, yet you still insist on trying foolish tricks which only the most
simplest, uncultured of all creatures would fall for. Quite frankly, I am
insulted that you would try such tactics on me. It insults my intelligence.
Anyway, now that I have given you a quick break…a break! Ha ha! I crack myself
up sometimes!” Frieza began to laugh like a maniac as Ginyu desperately tried
to do something, but as he is totally unable to move, he has no choice other
than to just endure the proceedings. It’s ok though, soon it will all be over,
The pain, the torment, the suffering. Soon he will be able to do whatever he
wants, in a far less corrupt galaxy. Even if he does go to hell for all the
wrong that he has accomplished in his life, it is better than continuing to work
for this evil bastard.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Frieza finishes his incessant laughing,
and finally decides to end everything for the man who he considers to be a
failure. He shoots Ginyu in the face with an insanely powerful blast, which
lights up the whole chamber, and which causes the walls to crack, and emit
cavities. Ginyu has his head blown clean off, and as it bounces along the floor,
spreading blood all over the place, the look in his hard, cold eyes show that he
was ready to go. The frame that he last saw has been frozen on his isolated
head, as he thanks the Gods for finally allowing him to get away from this
madman. His severed head leaks acidic purple blood, and his body lies,
motionless, without its head for the rest of eternity. Ginyu has been ejected
from the premises of the physical universe, but his soul will live on in the
hells, awaiting the arrival of Frieza, so that one day, he may finally gain his
vengeance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<div class="Section1">
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">A stray,
  singular pod, seemingly a long way from home leaves a glistening trail as it
  soars along the dark, starry depths of space. This pod is like no other
  though, a bares the tattoo of the evil emperor Frieza emblazoned upon its
  side. The pod leaves a streaming trail of brilliant white, and dashing orange.
  Inside the pod sits a distraught man, a man who once resembled true pride. Now
  he is nothing though, and he tries to relax in the pod, but is unsuccessful in
  his attempts, and ends up withering away, his mind rotting as he can bare to
  stay silent no longer.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“DAMNIT!
  I can’t believe that I’m running from Frieza! What is the point? He will
  peruse me no matter where I flee. The merciless idiot! I have got to merge
  with those on Earth, only then can I be sure of having a chance of victory”
  Zarbon shouted. “Actually, now that I come to think of it” he commented,
  starting to calm down a little “Ginyu should have arrived by now. I wonder
  what Frieza has done to him. Maybe I won’t need to run after all!”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Zarbon
  doesn’t sound at all optimistic, but he places his scouter on none-the-less,
  and starts flicking a few buttons.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Dodoria,
  tell me, how is Captain Ginyu?” Zarbon asked.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“He lost
  his head” responded the purple alien.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“What
  the hells that meant to mean you idiot?!”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Frieza
  blew his head clean off for disobeying him! Don’t come back Zarbon! Hide out
  in the farthest regions of the galaxy. He is already searching for you, it is
  only a matter of time before he finds you too. You must either hide, or kill
  yourself!”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“That
  wasn’t funny”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“It

  isn’t secure either, so don’t make any more scouter transmitions. Got it?</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yeah”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Good”
  Zarbon responded, as he takes the scouter off, and gazes silently into the
  vast area of space. The many planets decorate the otherwise lifeless sky, with
  their glowing gasses, and illuminating orbs of moons. He is immersed in a
  lifeless trans, watching, waiting, what hideous fate will await him? His
  destiny will be settles out there somewhere, but until then, Earth his primary
  target, and hopefully it will turn out to be a major ally.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Korosu is
  on the warpath, destroying everything in his site, as cold tears gather in his
  eyes. His fists are clenched hard, and his nose runs a little. Not bothering
  to wipe it away, Korosu eventually falls down to his knees, mourning over the
  loss of his good friend. Korosu digs his hands into the sandy ground, of the
  harsh, unforgiving planet. His tears create small streams, which run along the
  surface of the floor, trickling along to the boot of an extremely muscular
  soldier. A saiyan soldier. His tail swishes through the air with utmost ease,
  before coming to a rest on the sandy ground. Korosu takes a deep breath in,
  and wipes his tears away with his arm, considering it dishonorable to be seen
  in this weak state of mind. Korosu looks up, and admires the soldier.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">The saiyan
  that Korosu gazes at is extremely different to what he expected. The man was
  huge, at least a foot bigger than himself, with a fairly muscular build. He
  had an arrogant smile spreading across his face, along with a scar that runs
  down his cheek. His hair stands up on end, as is the way with most saiyans.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I am

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“What’s
  up with you the? Crying like a baby and all”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I’m
  not being a baby! My sensei just died to the hands of Frieza! I must gain
  revenge!”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Frieza?
  No way. I just returned on a planetary conquest mission for him! There’s no
  way that he would want to betray us after all that we have done for the
  guy!”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“His
  henchmen came in and totally dismantled everyone, and everything” Korosu
  started. “I was in the regeneration tank of the time, so I was lucky enough
  not to be noticed, but everyone else was les fortunate” This comment seems
  to strain Korosu greatly, as he closes his eyes tightly, in annoyance of him
  being out of the situation, and so useless during the battle.”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You got
  any proof kid?”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Proof?
  You want proof? There’s a whole God damned load of bodies in there –
  Saiyans, and Frieza’s henchmen! You go check them out, and then see if I’m
  lying!”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Whoa,
  calm down Korosu, I’ll go have a look” Bardock exclaimed mockingly.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Korosu
  fell to the floor; irate at not realizing that something was wrong when he was
  recovering. He starts pounding away at the helpless ground, beating it until
  his fists start to bleed. His tears have began to return, slowly trickling
  down his face, feeling ice cold on his hot, flustered face. He starts to roar
  with anger, hardly able to contain his rage. Gusts of energy flash from his
  sides, blowing everything in existence backwards, or so it seemed. He starts
  to roar out in pain and anguish. The waves of energy become more intense, and
  turn to pure, raw beams. He has a golden aura forming around him, roaring all
  the time. His hair gives a quick flash, turning blonde for less than a second,
  but immediately returning to its normal, black colour. The agonizing screaming
  continues, as the energy intensifies even more. The aura has become so
  powerful that Korosu is now standing in a crater, about his size. Bardock has
  long since come out of the building, and is looking on with a mixture of
  horror, and awe filling up his face. Korosu’s hair flashes blonde again, but
  this time maintains the colour for a few seconds. His eyes metamorphosize into
  a dull green, before he returns completely to his normal form, with the
  energy, and charging up coming to a rapid halt. He looks up, and notices that
  all eyes are focused on him, with occasional gasps flooding around the town.
  Bardock lowers his hand, and pulls Korosu up.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You….you….almost
  turned super saiyan just then!” Bardock exclaimed, somewhat disbelievingly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Frieza
  must pay! I need an army though! An army of purebred saiyans, hell bent on the
  destruction of Frieza and his forces!” Korosu yelled out, with his lungs
  shaking all the time due to the massive amounts of strain that they have been
  put under lately.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I’m
  in” Bardock stated coolly.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“How
  powerful are you?”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“15,000
  maximum, but I will not give up, and I shall fight for our people!”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Good,
  now let’s go, we have to prepare, as it may be a long journey ahead of us”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You
  know we’re not ready for Frieza just yet don’t you Korosu? I mean, we have
  to train like mad to beat him!”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I am
  going to fight him tomorrow! You don’t have to come. It’s your choice.
  Live with yourself if I die in battle with no one to watch my back”</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Damnit
  Korosu! That’s not fair! Ok, I’ll do it! I’ll meet you here, tomorrow at
  sunrise” Bardock submitted, with a tone of annoyance in his voice.</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Thank
  you Bardock. Remember to believe in yourself. I know that we can take this guy
  out!”</font></span></p>

  <div class="Section1">
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Zarbon
 gazes out of his pod, wondering how long it will be until he reaches his
 destination. The controls on his ship blink frantically, working hard in
 calculating the velocity, and distance to Earth. The pod leaves a trail of
 flickering. bright light behind it, slicing through a piece of space. Zarbon
 is starting to wish that he put himself in suspending animation, because
 then at least he wouldn’t need to put up with this tedious staring.
 Staring, that’s all that he was able to do right now. He was helpless to
 do anything else, due to the lack of resources in his ship. A female voice
 comes into perspective, and Zarbon listens intently to the soft, sweet
 voice. This is the part that he loved about the journeys. That heavenly
 voice, personally addressing him. He didn’t care if it was only a computer
 simulated voice, it was a voice talking to him, and personally referring to
 him as ‘Zarbon-sama’, showing utmost respect for him.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“1 day
 until landing on Earth Zarbon-sama” the voice whispered softly. Zarbon
 smiled, and then flicked a switch on the control panel. Some more lights
 flickered a little, and the females voice trailed off.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Better
 have a quick nap so that I’m fresh for when I arrive on Earth. Then, I can
 recruit some people, and take out that asshole Frieza!” Zarbon thought out
 loud. He slammed his fist down hard on the nearest solid object at the
 mention of Frieza’s name. That man was nothing but scum, a bully, an evil
 tyrant with nothing but impending doom focused on the universe. Zarbon
 rested his head, and closed his eyes, growing impatient of the wait that he
 is suffering before he can reach his destination.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Korosu
 marches into the nearest training center. Luckily for him, he was only a few
 hours drive away, but a minute long fly. Obviously, he chose the quickest
 route, and flew with intense speed. The training center was an old, worn
 down wooden building, which has seen better days. It was the only one that
 the saiyans were allowed to have on the dark side of their mediocre planet.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I
 must grow stronger! I have no choice other than to train….to train long
 and hard!” Korosu started. “Frieza, you will pay for all that you have
 done!”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“May I
 help you sir?” an assistant asked from the other side of the door.
 Realizing that he was talking to himself, Korosu clenches his fists, and
 barges straight into the door, knocking it off its hinges.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Erm…sir,
 you’re going to have to pay for that” the assistant mumbling weakly.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Shut
 the fuck up asshole!” was the subtle reply that he received as Korosu
 brushed passed him, then stormed into a graviton room.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Let’s
 see, I have about 15 hours until I have to meet Bardock. I have to get more
 powerful. I feel much stronger than I did before….but why?”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Just
 then, Korosu goes into a flashback. Otaku is there, looking very concerned.
 There is a man, injured badly. It’s none other than the gallant saiyan
 himself! It’s him! Otaku moves closer to him, and whispers something into
 his ear. The words seem unclear, and a bit sketchy at first, but then Korosu
 concentrates harder, and begins to hear the words entwined in a loop. Over
 and over in his mind. Suddenly, it hits him, piercing his heart in a shrill
 tone, and making him fall back with fear. The voice is so vivid that he
 could have sworn that it was real. “This will make you stronger, maybe
 even more so than me” is what Otaku had said right after he had beaten him
 to a pulp. He was right too, Korosu had become stronger.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">He
 reawakens from is flashback, and is hit with a whole new enlightenment. He
 grins, knowing what he must do. Korosu bursts into the graviton room, and
 sets the machine to 10 times the gravity on the Planet Saiya. This is equal
 to 20 times the gravity on most other thriving planets, such as Earth. He is
 pulled down to the floor straight away, landing heavily on his arm. Korosu
 curses, but gets up, despite the intense pain flowing through him.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Damnit,
 this is hard! I can’t give up though!” Korosu yelled, as he struggled to
 stay standing up. “I must fight on! Frieza is going to pay for this!”.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">A knock
 ensues this comment, as the door shakes a little. Korosu stares towards it,
 and starts to attempt to walk over to it. He stumbles over, having to send a
 weak blast at the floor to help him regain his balance. He succeeds, and
 starts towards the door again. He gets fairly close to it, with beads of
 sweat pouring off his face, and making loud impact upon hitting the floor.
 He attempts to open it, but the person there has become impatient, and slams
 it open, hitting Korosu in the face, and knocking him off his feet. The man
 who walks in is a man of intrigue. He has a long, thin scar running down his
 cheek, and a goofy grin spread across his face.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Bardock
 you idiot!” Korosu shouted.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Oops”
 Bardock laughed.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“This
 isn’t funny!”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I beg
 to differ”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Shut
 up”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Don’t
 be such a baby! Anyway, I heard that you’d be here, so I came down.”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“So?”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“So,
 we can train together”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Oh
 goody, I’m so happy”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Me
 too”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I was
 being sarcastic”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Oh”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Lets
 get on with it then” Korosu said reluctantly. Bardock gleefully walks in,
 but is pulled right down by the gravity pull. He lands flat on his face, in
 complete agony. It is now Korosu’s turn to laugh, as he walks over to the
 fallen saiyan, and hoists him up. The two of them race around the small
 chamber, with neither one of them moving at any real speed. It takes them
 about 4 hours to get used to the gravity, which is unusually quick for such
 low level warriors. They can soon move at their regular speed, and they
 train with all their effort, punching the air, slicing through it with jabs,
 and cutting across it with skillful kicks. They train like this for about an
 hour, but soon grow tired of the tedious work.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Let’s
 spar” Bardock suggested.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Why
 spar? If we both get injured, then our power levels will go up more!”
 Korosu replied excitedly.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You
 sure?”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Of
 course”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“How
 many regeneration tanks are left?”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“2 on
 this side of the planet, both in the medical bay down the road.”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Ok,
 how shall we fight? All out, or playfully?”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“All
 out of course, but first, get that stain of your shirt!” Korosu chuckled.
 Bardock looks down for it, but is met with a fist instead of any sort of
 mark. Korosu follows it up with a knee into the gut, sending Bardock onto
 his knees, gasping for air. The saiyan grabs Korosu’s ankles, desperately
 trying to get up, but to no avail. The high gravity is making it even harder
 for him to breathe, but he won’t give up. Bardock gets to his feet, but
 Korosu plants his fist in the exact same place for the second time in a row.
 Bardock spits blood everywhere upon impact, slowly fading away, and dropping
 down to the floor. He is coughing violently, with blood squirting from his
 throat, and plastering the newly cleaned floor. Korosu pulls Bardock up by
 his hair, and mocks the limp figure.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Go
 home Bardock, you have no chance of so much as getting a shot in at Frieza
 if you fight like this! Look at you! You can’t even stand up by yourself!
 I refuse to associate myself with such a failure. In fact, I refuse to so
 much as train in the same room as you, weakling!” Korosu shouted, as he
 walks away, dropping Bardocks lifeless body onto the floor.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Is
 that all you got?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>said a
 voice from the chamber. “Come on, don’t run off, I’m not done yet!”
 the voice shouted. “Come on!” it echoed.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Bardock?”
 Korosu asked, before turning round. “Jesus, you’re up! Well, best make
 you realize when you’re beaten eh?”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Just
 try it” Bardock taunted, as he held out his hand, and gestured Korosu in.
 “This time you wont catch me off guard!”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Korosu
 chuckles to himself at Bardocks ignorance. This guy is full of himself. He
 doesn’t understand that the almighty Korosu is now the strongest saiyan in
 existence! Oh well, best teach him a hard lesson, at least then he will
 become far more powerful.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Let’s
 do this then! No stopping for injuries this time, it’s an all out fight.
 Only way to lose is to give up!” Korosu yelled, as he ran into the room,
 towards the waiting Bardock.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You
 got it,” his saiyan counterpart replied coolly. Bardock dodged the first
 punch of Korosu’s. Well, it was more of a wild, aimless swing than
 anything else, but Bardock didn’t care. He was going to make Korosu suffer
 for his mistake. Bardock kicks Korosu in the leg with incredible force,
 sending him sprawling to the floor. Before he lands though, Bardock elbows
 him in the kidneys with massive momentum, sending him crashing down hard
 into the cold, concrete floor. Korosu looks up, with eyes filled with pain
 and agony. Bardock smiles, then starts pounding away at Korosu’s stomach.
 It makes his training partner cough up some blood of his own, as the
 punishment continues. A crater is being formed due to the sheer power behind
 the punches of Bardocks, as he takes out all of his anguish on the one man,
 the man who is hoping to defeat Frieza. Korosu desperately shoots a KI blast
 at Bardocks face, sending him to the floor. Both men lie there for a minute,
 totally motionless, with the only movement coming from their pours, as
 gallons of sweat is emitted. A huge crash comes from their left, and they
 turn to see that the wall has been ripped right off. There stands Frieza, in
 all of his glory.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">‘Shit!’
 Bardock thought to himself.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">‘Fuck,
 neither of us can move, let alone fight this monster! What are we going to
 do!’ Korosu pondered, beginning to panic. Frieza simply laughed at the
 situation, then stepped into the room, seemingly unaffected by the increased
 gravity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></span></p>

<div class="Section1">
  <div class="Section1">
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Frieza
 stands high above the two fallen warriors, looking down with loathing
 repulsion at the people who he considers to be the lowest form of scum. He
 snorts in disgust at them, then examines the spacious training room. It has
 been battered to the point where not even the most skilled craftsmen have a
 chance of reviving it. Cracks litter the wall, and small craters fill the
 ground. The graviton machine is shaking wildly after all the pressure
 exerted onto it. It isn’t used to going up to anymore than 20 times normal
 gravity, but now it is far more than it was perhaps even made for. Frieza
 slowly twists the dial, patronizing the two lowly saiyans, eventually taking
 the gravity down to the norm for the planet. He strides up and down the
 capacious room, occasionally staring down at the two injured men. He finally
 stops, and stands righteously, with his webbed feet digging hard into the
 cold, unforgiving, blood-soaked concrete floor.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You
 foolish monkeys! What do you think you are doing! Bow to your emperor! Oh,
 you refuse to co-operate? In that case, I guess we will have to beat you
 into submission, and force you to kiss my unlawful toes! Fortunately for you
 though, I have just got a new uniform, after splattering the blood of that
 weakling Ginyu all over it, so I am not prepared to get it dirty again. As
 much as I would like to stay and watch you two worthless monkeys get
 destroyed, I have business to attend to.” Frieza said harshly, before
 spitting down onto the bloody face of Korosu, and walking out, with his
 bulky tail swishing in the icy wind. He stops for some unknown reason
 though, and waves his hand towards the saiyans. “Dodoria, finish them off!
 You had better not fail me!”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Don’t
 worry master Frieza, I shall not be like that fool Zarbon, I shall be loyal
 forever, and I shall crush these worthless, puny saiyans”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Good”
 Frieza responded, before taking extremely large strides, walking almost at a
 jogging pace, eventually disappearing out of sight, swallowed up by the mist
 on the horizon.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Now
 we can have some fun monkeys!” Dodoria laughed evilly, as his pink flab
 wobbled consistently. Korosu summons up all of the energy inside of him,
 before eventually managing to stand, albeit somewhat limply. The left side
 of his body hangs loosely, swaying a little, giving him an insecure feeling.
 He grasps his arm tightly, obviously feeling a lot of pain in it. With a
 look of sheer determination and hatred on his face, Korosu wipes the blood
 from his lip with the back of his palm. He is about to charge in, when
 Bardock pulls himself up, with the use of the graviton machine. He too is
 struggling to remain on his feet, but rather than holding his arm, Bardock
 is heavily favouring his face which he was blasted in earlier. He is hardly
 managing to stand, with blood dripping down his eye, almost in the shape of
 a tear. His left eye is half shut, and fully bloodshot. Despite having a
 hard time seeing, Bardock won’t give up, and pushes himself away to join
 his comrades side in battle.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You’re
 not going to win that easy you big fat bastard!” Korosu yelled at the top
 of his voice.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Am I
 meant to be intimidated in the slightest by that comment monkey?” Dodoria
 mocked.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Fuck
 you!” shouted Bardock, as he fought off the pain, and began to charge up
 to his maximum. The intensity of the energy that is being built up
 strengthens, and sends roaring waves of Ki formed winds across the room.
 What little of the floor that was previously intact has now been completely
 demolished. Dodoria has started to look a little worried, and a small bead
 of sweat drips down his face, signifying this. Korosu smirks at the look of
 exasperation rapidly taking over Dodoria’s face, so he yells out in
 excruciating agony, and begins to charge up himself. His method is different
 to that of Bardock. He is engulfed in a blue aura of pure, raw energy, which
 elevates with every extra bit of effort that he puts into it. The energy
 becomes so great that the room collapses, unable to takes the strain of all
 that is being given off. The ground shakes as Korosu continues to charge up,
 wave upon wave of brute, intensive energy being released, until eventually,
 he is at the highest possible fighting power that he is able to achieve. It
 isn’t even half of his maximum, due to the extent of his injuries, and
 Bardock has the same problem. They breathe heavily, trying to regain some
 sort of awareness before the battle begins. Dodoria tries to read their
 power levels, but Bardock quickly, and cunning shoots a small KI beam at his
 scouter, destroying it immediately, and rendering it useless.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“There,
 now you don’t know what you’re up against!” Bardock beamed at Dodoria,
 in a mildly cocky way.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Just
 you wait, I’ll still beat you easily!” Dodoria shouted in a very
 flustered way.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Don’t
 make me laugh, both of us are twice as strong as you, or even Frieza could
 possibly be!” Korosu chuckled, coughing up some blood as he does so.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Doesn’t
 look like you’re in the position to say things like that my friend”
 Dodoria mocked. “Your time has come! You shall die a dishonorable death,
 losing after using idle threats, and words showing off your cowardice! Now
 watch my true power soar!” Dodoria mumbled quietly and unclearly. He holds
 his arms out to his side, then smirks confidently. He begins to charge up
 his KI, making him even more powerful with every second. Bardock and Korosu
 struggle to stay on their feet due to the sheer intensity of it. Dodoria can
 be seen laughing manically through the mist of energy that is being formed,
 and given off. Eventually, the roaring aura dies down, as Dodoria finished
 summoning up all his energy. An epic fight will soon ensue……<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></span></p>

 piercing wind slowly blows across the wrecked training room. It seeps
 through the many cracks, crevices and gaps in the wall, and wreaks havoc
 with the saiyans hair, blowing it to and fro, but unable to mess it up.
 Dodoria tries some intimidation tactics, but they are in vain. Korosu and
 Bardock aren’t going to give up that easily, and they are psyched up for
 this battle. A small, yet sharp chill is sent down Bardock’s spine, and
 the shiver was the error that Dodoria was waiting for. He charges in at an
 incredible pace, especially for someone with his build, and delivers a
 large, pink, scaly fist into Bardock’s gut, sending him crashing to the
 floor immediately, desperately searching for streaks of air. Dodoria merely
 laughs at him, then spits on him.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Stupid

 me?”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Heh,
 I’m not done yet lard arse!” Bardock shouted aggressively, as he let a
 roar of agony, pulling himself up, and heavily favouring his stomach. Before
 continuing his little speech, Bardock began coughing manically, eventually
 ejecting some excess blood from his mouth, and staining his formerly clean,
 shining, saiyan boots, which had been newly issued to him by Otaku, the
 leader of the saiyan rebellion. “You bastard! Those were my favourite
 boots! I can’t get another pair like those! Now, you die!” Bardock
 yelled.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You
 seem to have a lot of tough words monkey, but you haven’t been able to
 back them up yet have you now?” taunted Dodoria.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Now!”
 screamed Bardock, catching Dodoria off guard. Korosu fired a small KI blast
 at the pink alien, narrowly missing the elite soldier. Korosu curses, but
 knows that he has done his bit, with Bardock burying his fist deep into the
 huge, slimy gut of Dodoria’s before the alien could turn round to see what
 was happening. Without giving him any time to think, Korosu started to
 charge up an energy beam, hoping to use it to finish off the alien. Blue
 energy slowly began to merge together in his hands, with bright, blindingly
 white streaks of light shooting from it.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Dodoria
 recovers from the blow, and hammers down hard on Bardocks head, knocking him
 face first into the hard, unforgiving concrete floor. Bardocks nose seemed
 to snap as it made contact, with him confined to taking a beating, too weak
 to fight back. Dodoria holds out the palm of his hand, ready to blast
 Bardock to his death, but the saiyan has some more tricks up his sleeve.
 ‘This is my last bit of energy, so it had better do the job!’ Bardock
 thought to himself, before shooting two, diminutive energy beams into
 Dodoria’s eyes, temporarily blinding him.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“That
 was all I had left” Bardock told Korosu weakly.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“It’ll
 do” was the reply that he received.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Good,
 now I hope that beam is powerful enough to finish this asshole off!”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Don’t
 worry about that, just hope that I can remain standing during this!”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You
 bastards!” Dodoria butted in, still holding his eyes in excruciating
 agony. “What have you done? No more Mr nice guy! I’m finished you off
 right now!” His hands were removed from his eyes at this point, revealing
 nothing but a white, swirling vortex. Gone are the pupils, and the bland
 white background for them. He doesn’t seem to have regained full control
 over his vision yet, but can make out two blurs, which is all he needs to
 see for now.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“What
 did you do?” Korosu asked Bardock, but before the reply could even come, a
 surge of energy came across him. “Bardock, it’s ready! Problem is, it
 could finish us both of if I don’t get it exactly on target!”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Just
 throw the damn thing! If we don’t kill him now, he’ll kill us!”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Ok,
 Dodoria, it is time for the suffering that you have plagued people with to
 end! This is for all of the saiyans who’s pride you have ruptured, and
 who’s families you have distraught, prepare to die scum!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Just
 throw it!”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I am!
 Give me time! I have to get it accurate otherwise…”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I
 know, just aim then fire! Damn, do it quickly, it looks like Dodoria is
 getting his sight back. Damn, I wish I could move to help you out!”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You’re
 damn right monkey!” snickered Dodoria. “I have now fully got my sight
 back, so prepare for Armageddon!” He looked towards Bardock, replying the
 KI blast that he dealt him over and over in his mind. His white, swirling
 eyes swell up with an inferno of hatred. He swings back his fist, and hits
 Bardock in the ribs, making several cracking sounds, signaling the breakage
 caused. Before he can do anything else though, he sees a large shadow
 eclipse him. Dodoria looks for the source of the shadow, but doesn’t see
 it until it is inches away from him. He tries to move, but Bardock makes a
 grab for his ankles, and manages to hold on. That extra motion slowed
 Dodoria down enough. The beam hit him, exploding on contact, and wiping out
 the whole room. The lifeless corpse of Bardock is blown back, as his eyes
 slowly close, and his consciousness fades. Korosu keeps the beam going, as
 it makes more and more of a blast, destroying the surrounding area, and
 using up all of his remaining reserves of energy. All that can be heard from
 the rapidly increasing mound of smoke is Dodoria’s screams, as he pleads
 for mercy, but to no avail. Korosu isn’t listening, he doesn’t care. All
 his concentration is focused on this explosive beam. He lets off a loud
 scream, then pours one final, extra surge of brute energy into the
 devastating attack, blowing Dodoria backwards, and causing an explosion
 which could be seen on another planet. This one if far superior to the
 ongoing one that had been taking place during the early phases of the
 attack. Korosu is blown backwards by the intensive waves of energy, and the
 backlash from the explosion. Dodoria’s screams are lost in the abyss of
 smoke and fire. People flood onto the scene to see Dodorias decapitated
 motionless corpse, with blood pouring from every orifice. They come to the
 conclusion that he must be dead after that explosion, but check his pulse
 none-the-less.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“He’s
 definitely dead. That bastard is finally dead!”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Who
 killed him though” a saiyan bystander asked.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I saw
 Korosu and Bardock round here earlier”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Na,
 there’s no way that they could be powerful enough to beat this guy! He has
 wreaked chaos upon the saiyan for centuries! How could two regular soldiers
 beat him? It doesn’t make any sense! I mean, they’re strong, but surely
 not that strong!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You
 shouldn’t underestimate them, although it is hard to believe”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“That
 would mean that they are the two most powerful saiyan in existence
 wouldn’t it?” This comment was the final unsocialized one that found its
 way into the heads of others, as chaos breaks lose, with everyone shouting
 and screaming at each other, in disbelief. The commotion finally dies down
 into a calm, yet deadly silence. A powerful presence is around, and they
 know it. Rubble moves from the building, and they all get into their
 fighting stances. More rubble moves, and eventually, a huge chuck is
 removed. A battered warrior comes out with another one on his shoulder. Both
 of these have tails. They are covered in cuts, bruises, and blood from the
 battle, and have their bones sticking out in some places, such is the extent
 of the injuries. The man carrying his comrade collapses all of a sudden,
 motionless, lifeless, still, with no sign of breathing.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“It’s
 Korosu….and Bardock!” shouted an anonymous member of the gathered croud.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“They’re
 dead” shouted another one.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You’d
 better be wrong!”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I
 dunno, check em out”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I
 will” said a saiyan, who looked to be somewhat skilled, and respected by
 the other saiyans, as he came in, and checked their pulses. His face
 displays a look of terrible horror, telling them all what they didn’t want
 to hear, without the need to speak a word. Groans, and aggravated shouts of
 annoyance spread around the crowd, with women crying, and men trying, but
 failing to hide their emotion. The saiyans who took Bardock and Korosu’s
 pulse wiped a tear away from his face, then stood up.</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“These
 two warriors have fought gallantly. They won the battle, but lost the war.
 We shall carry on this war! Who’s with me?”</font></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“ME!”
 everyone shouted at once, as they all ran down to the quaint docking ports
 on the other side of town…..</font><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

 <div class="Section1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">‘Damn,
my head is aching!’ Korosu thought to himself. ‘Where am I? Am I dead?
Is this hell?’ His head was filling with all kinds are strange, paranoid
thoughts, but he couldn’t come to a conclusion over any of them. His
heart pounds hard, as he begins to fear the worst. ‘What the hell
happened? I remember an alien…and a building’ his thoughts turned into
words spewing forth from out of his mouth. “Dodoria. Damnit! I can’t
believe that bastard ended my life! What a way to go!” It was then that
he realized that he was swallowed large quantities of fluid as he spoke.
He used some of the very little energy reserves that remain in his body,
and opens one eye. Before him is a sheet of clear, transparent glass, and
in front of that is a control panel…with some doctors! Korosu opens his
other eye triumphantly, and a smile begins to form upon his face. He sees
bubbles coming from his mouth, then realizes where he is. “A regen tank!
I’m alive!” He begins to dance around a little, before having to
submit to the pain caused by the tearing muscles in his body. A doctor
walks over, and starts speaking into the tank, to Korosu. Most of what he
says isn’t received though, because at this present moment in time,
Korosu is too busy rejoicing life to worry about anything else. He shuts
his eyes, and lets his mind wander, relaxing for the first time since the
rebellion had started…</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
fluid starts to drain from the tank, and Korosu’s eyes open in a flash.
He anxiously waits for the glass panel to open for him, and when it does,
he bursts out, dancing around, and testing his strength. “I’m alive!
I’m really alive!”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yes
Korosu. That was very close, we thought that we’d lost you for a while.
You were in the regen tank for 8 hours!” the doctor said excitedly.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Damn,
I’m pretty lucky to be alive! But…Bardock…”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“He
was hurt far worse than you were. His condition is stable at the moment,
but we are not sure if he can hold on, and maintain it.”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Damn!
He’d better not die, because if he does…”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Please,
calm down. We are doing all that we can, this is sophisticated stuff, and
it is very delicate too, so if you wouldn’t mind waiting outside…”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I
can’t leave Bard..”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Outside!”
The doctor spoke in such a harsh tone that Korosu didn’t want to
disagree with him, because he knew that although Bardock may not be
stable, the doctors know best, and they are doing all they can for him.
Korosu wonders through the long corridors, and out through the huge front
door of the infirmary. The saiyan soldier stops, and breaths in a long,
deep breath of fresh air, knowing that he has been granted a second
chance. He extends his arms, and lets the wind flow freely in his thick,
spiked up hair. A smile pulls itself across his heartless face. This man
has killed 1,000s without remorse, and all it took to change him was a
near-death experience. Korosu has made up his mind. From now on he will be
different. He has changed. There is not a single innocent person in the
universe that will die by his hand again. His ultimate goal remains the
same though…he will meet Frieza in a battle to the death, with one of
them meeting their demise in a colossal fight, of absolutely epic
proportions.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Korosu!
We…we…thought you were dead! Thank God that you survived! It’s
terrible, everyone has gone off to Frieza to avenge your death!” said a
short, saiyan woman, fairly well-built, but obviously no soldier.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Then
they are already dead” was Korosu’s reply. His voice wall cold,
shrill, emotionless. He wasn’t about to run off to try and save them. He
knew the extent of Frieza’s power, and because of that, he knew it would
be insane to challenge him. “Bardock…he…he hasn’t recovered yet.
He may not make it. If he dies, then…Frieza…you are going to die a
slow, agonizing death, for sending your men to kill us!”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Bardock…I
hope he survives, but why do you not care about the rest of our race
damnit! They’re all going to fight Frieza, and you don’t even want to
help them!”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“It’s
not like that!” Korosu roared in reply. “Look, Frieza is more powerful
than our whole race combined, there is no point in adding to the
casualties. Dodoria wasn’t even a 20th of Frieza’s power! I almost
died beating him! He...he is dead isn’t he? There’s no way that he
could have survived that. He better not have, because..”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“He’s
dead Korosu. Don’t worry yourself with things like that though. If
Frieza is as powerful as you say he is, then you’re our last hope. You
must train, and train hard. Saiyans strength improves when they are close
to death, so you must have got stronger after that fight.”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Good
point. Take my power level, it was 15,000 at my maximum.”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
woman walks over to a small stall, and takes a scouter from the stand. The
stall owner has been listening in to the conversation, so he doesn’t
stop her, as he is anxious to see the reading too. She puts it over her
eye, and flicks a few switches on it. Before she says anything though, her
face goes into a look of shock. “30…30,000! How did you increase by so
much!?”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Korosu
smiles wickedly. “You haven’t seen anything yet, now take it at my
maximum!” He starts to charge up, energy being thrown around the street
incessantly. An aura of blue, intensive power starts to form around him.
He clenches his fists, trying desperately to add an extra bit onto his
final power reading. He lets out a cry, then the aura fades, and he glows,
illuminating the dingy streets. The look on the woman’s face says it
all.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“50,000.”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Not
bad eh?” Korosu boasted. “Still not good enough though. Frieza’s is
said to be around 500,000! What chance have I got against that!”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You’ll
beat him eventually, just not yet” a stern voice said, full of
prominence, and respect.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Huh?
Who are you?” Korosu and the woman asked together.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I
am a doctor, and I have come to report Bardock’s condition”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“How
is he! He’s dead isn’t he! Shit!”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“No,
he is alive, and he will be out of the tank in a couple of hours.”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Brilliant!”
Korosu shouted.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yes,
but I suggest you leave this planet Korosu. You are the strongest that we
have got, and if Frieza comes again, then it’s all over. Go to the
planet Earth. That is where Kakarot was sent when he was a child, and it
seems to be quite a peaceful planet. You can train there for a while, and
come back when you are strong enough to beat Frieza.” <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I
will. Thank you for the advice. I shall leave tomorrow morning, with
Bardock. In fact, he should be pretty powerful too shouldn’t he?”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yes.”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Bardock
finally awakens in his regeneration tank, and as the cold, callus water
drains slowly away, he pulls off the wires connected to his body. His
muscles seem to bulge as he steps out, and it takes the saiyan about a
minute to regain his stance, as he topples around, grabbing desperately
for anything he can. When he finally does regain his balance and stance,
he sees clearly for the first time in a while. A smile brightens his face
up completely, and glee fills the air. He runs out, testing his improved
strength, bouncing off the walls, seeing how fast he can go, almost as if
he has just been released from a confining cell. He is greeted by Korosu,
where everything is explained to him. They talk for a while about the
fight, and spar with each other, then head off to bed, ready to get a good
nights sleep, with Korosu being plagued with the though of all the other
saiyans going off to attack Frieza. The end of his people is nigh, but he
is powerless to stop it. If only he had set off to catch them up though,
what difference would it have made? It would have got him killed as well
as everyone else. It wasn’t worth it, but now his conscience will eat
away at him. Korosu begins to think of how he managed to survive after
sustaining such heavy injuries. He thinks back to the fight with Dodoria,
as his dreams are clouded with thoughts from the battle…..</font></span></p>

</h3>
		  
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Korosu’s
alarm went off, and he immediately jerked up, and looked around with a swift
alertness. He quickly looks around for something, and in a short amount of time
he finds it – A small coin, Saiyan currency, with a few scratches on, and a
dent that has a prominent sign of age on it. This has saved Korosu in many a
battle, as people have attacked him with weapons of some kind, and managed only
to hit this coin. It was a rare one at that, harder than any armour, and capable
of withstanding any attack. Korosu clenches it in his hand, squeezing it
tightly, before smirking defiantly. He jumps out of bed, grabs a black,
distinctive sweatshirt, and pulls it on over himself. He then goes over to an
antique chest of drawers, and pulls out some black trousers. He puts them on,
then he quickly slips some boots on, hoping that they will give him some extra
spring in his step, and added mobility. He then grabs a chest piece of armour,
and pulls it over his head, with it expanding to a perfect fit. He stretches a
little, then does a few practice punches into the air to make sure that the
clothing that he is wearing is the most efficient clothing possible. He is happy
with it, and tucks his small coin into his chest plate, as if it is for good
luck. He closes his eyes, then concentrates as much as he possibly can. Suddenly
his eyes jerk open, and his smirk turns into an evil look.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Frieza, I
may not be strong enough to beat you now, I may not be strong enough to beat you
in 1, 5, even 10 years, but rest assured, I shall defeat you, and when I do, I
shall avenge my people!” Korosu said slowly, and quietly in a shrill tone. He
is psyched up to train as hard as possible, and he is ready to squash any of
Frieza’s followers who stand in his way. He walks out of the door, and puts a
menacing mood about the place just from his harsh frown. He walks quickly along
the road, ready to meet Bardock at a small site, arranged especially for their
trip.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">A pod
continues its path, systematically closing in on its target. A tall, slim man
scratches his chin, and then brushes his long braid of hair backwards. He looks
out of the window arrogantly, then gives off an excited squeal. He can see the
planet Earth, and is only about a minute until he lands there. Ecstatic, the man
tightly grips the arms on his chair, grinning, beaming, filling the pod with a
perfect radiance, happiness is spreading to every orifice of the quaint ship,
with even the computer sounding more cheerful than usual. Of course, this could
just be the mans mood, for when he is happy, nothing ever seems to go wrong.
This man feels free for the first time for years. He holds on tightly as the pod
enters the Earth’s atmosphere, with a tail of fire waving from it. It comes to
a halt on impact, causing a crater the size of a house. It has landed, the man
is free to exit the pod, and start his new life of training, not in fear, but
through sheer determination for revenge. The pod door slowly opens, and out
walks Zarbon. He breathes in the fresh air of Earth, and compares it to the
planet Saiya mentally, in his head. ‘Hmmm, this doesn’t smell like
pig-swill. Interesting. Maybe I should conquer this planet, and become overlord
of all that reside here. Maybe, just maybe. Better take the power readings then,
see if anyone has a power that can even match that of a…a… vile, despicable
Saiyan.’</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">He pulls out
a scouter from his pocket, and places it over his eye. He rotates on his foot,
using it as a pivot, moving in a circle. The scouter gives off the occasional
blink. “Damn, the highest power level here is only 5,000! That’s nothing
compared to mine, or even a lowly Saiyans! How am I going to beat Frieza with
such a weak army? Damnit, reports of this planet were wrong! It’s not even
worth checking it out! Ah well, I guess I might as well destroy it. No…wait,
that would be such a waste. Looks like the planet will have a new ruler –
Zarbon. No wait, Lord Zarbon. Nice ring to it.” He contemplated to himself,
thinking out loud, finally deciding on a course of action. “Yep, I’m going
to overthrow this planet, and claim it as my own! Guess I’d better go kill
those puny warriors, hope they don’t get my uniform dirty!” At this, Zarbon
took off towards the power level, following the course that his scouter assigned
to him. He ponders over how good it feels to finally stretch his legs after
being cramped up in that tiny pod for all that time.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">A group of
Saiyan pods approach an isolated ship, on its own, floating in the middle of
space. There seems to be no sign of life in it, with all lights off, and no
engines sound. The pods rapidly near their destination, as many of these
warriors may meet an untimely death, meeting their fate, trying to defeat a man
far more powerful than they could ever be. There was always a chance of victory
though, because nothing is impossible.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">The ship
seems to suddenly spring to life, with lights flickering on in every single
floor of the large, circular, intimidating vessel. It’s engines roar loudly,
as it rises to a height far higher than the pods could ever reach in such a
short space of time. A hatch opens at the top of the ship, and out floats
Frieza, in his trademark hovering chair, his horns adding to his menacing look,
as he ponders over what to do to the fleet of Saiyans. They have all changed
direction now, and are closing in hastily on Frieza. He laughs as they approach
him, and raises his finger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
miniscule ball of energy slowly sparks, then it grows rapidly, into the size of
a small planet, such as King Kai’s. He throws down the energy, with it
immersing many of the pods, and totally dismantling them, causing absolute
devastation. Only a few Saiyans’ ships manage to emerge from the carnage, with
smoke trailing from their bases, and small fires inside the hull. Frieza is
having a great time, as he looks on with the mediocre and weak Saiyans panicking
badly, knowing that it was a suicide mission all along. He points out a finger,
and lets out a comparatively weak blast, which easily tares through the pod,
nailing the target passengers in the head, and ripping straight through their
skulls. Frieza continues to do a few more of these blasts, leaving only one pod
in the air, adrift from the others, casually floating helplessly in the air,
unable to do anything, as it slowly begins its descent. The controller of the
ship is obviously long dead, or unconscious. It turns into a flaming wreak as
Frieza quickly uses a powerful eye laser on it, laughing manically all the time.
He looks around for more ‘Monkeys’ to play with, but finds none. He gives an
annoyed grunt, almost upset that he destroyed them so fast, not giving himself
time to play around with them. He lowers himself back into the ship, closing the
hatch, and relaxing for a bit.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Those
Saiyans think that they can take on me? Well, they could become a pain if there
were too many of them, so I think that I’d best take them all out now, before
there is any more rebellion…” Frieza is interrupted by a soldier who bursts
in, panting, and sweating from the long run to the room.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Sir…”
he begins. “Dodoria…he’s…he’s dead. Saiyans killed him.”</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“What?!
That’s it! First they kill the Ginyu Force, my own private army, and now
Dodoria? You, soldier, tell everyone to halt the search for Zarbon for a short
while, I have a little bit of business to take care of…” his voice trails
off as it is overtaken with laughing, as he finds the prospect of impending doom
for the Saiyans somewhat hilarious.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Korosu
arrives at the small launch pad, meeting Bardock there, as they both patiently
wait outside a huge ship. It is about the size of fifteen Saiyan pods combined,
and can easily fit two people in, allowing for some excess space too. Korosu and
Bardock climb in, both psyched up for the long journey to Earth. They have
already had a long lecture about the controls when they woke up, over a phone
call, so they are fluent in all the mechanics of the ship. The thing that
excited Korosu most was the graviton machine. It allowed for extra training, and
more intensive conditions.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Korosu hits
the key to blast off, and the ships engine starts to buzz loudly. It takes off
from the ground, and rapidly makes its assent, gaining height all the time. It
eventually pulls away, turning into a mere spec, lost in the density of space
that surrounds the universe. Bardock and Korosu’s journey has begun, many
hazards await them, but for now, they are safe, and will remain so for a short
time, a very short time.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">Frieza
stands on top of his ship, atrocious rage in his eyes, as he watches the
skirmishing planet Saiya, as the inhabitants stroll around, unaware of their
fate, as Frieza seals it. He raises a hand, then elevates his index finger. A
large, black ball forms on it, and crackles with electrical energy. It becomes
truly gigantic, and gets to the point where even the mighty Frieza is struggling
to balance it. He decides that the ball is of a suitable size, then launches it
down towards the planet, with it gaining speed and momentum upon breaking into
the planets atmosphere. It hits, then drives itself down to the core, exploding
upon reaching its designated target.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">The whole
planet begins to shake, with people screaming, and lava erupting from the
ground, in regular villages, towns, and cities. The planet swings on its axis
momentarily, and Frieza’s men on the light side of Saiya realize that their
master doesn’t care about them, as they can only let out one final scream of
pain upon the explosion of the planet. A noise is heard which spreads afar, even
reaching frontier planets. A blinding flash of brilliant white light ensues, as
the planet disappears into the depths of space, reduced to mere rubble, barely
visible to the eye. Amongst all this rubble, a ship flies away triumphantly,
after narrowly outrunning the explosion. It is too far away now for Frieza to
see it, making him think that the entire Saiyan race has been extinct.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Well,
that was fun” Frieza chuckled to himself, as if he had just been on a bouncy
castle. Showing no signs of remorse, he lowers himself back onto the deck of his
ship, closing the hatch, and laughing all the way to his quarters, scaring even
his own servants.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
sickening laugh just emphasizes Frieza’s hatred for all, but the Saiyans that
he missed were the most powerful ones in the universe. Had he have known this,
then he would have chased them all the way to the ends of the Earth, but he
didn’t know, did he?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div class="Section1">
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Korosu and Bardock gleefully
  gaze out of the window of their ship, taking in the atmosphere of this rare
  occurrence. It is not often that anybody gets to travel through space, and the
  two Saiyans know this. Korosu snaps out of his day dream, and realizes that
  there is training to be done. Being strong is the most important thing in the
  world to a Saiyan, and it is not an easy feat to achieve. Many have tried, and
  failed to become powerful, but Korosu and Bardock seem to have a certain
  promise about them, which overwhelm most other species, and even members of
  their own race.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Korosu walks over to the
  graviton, and turns the dial so it is at 50 times the gravity on the planet
  Saiya, or at least, 50 times of what it would have been, had the planet not
  blown up. The two Saiyans are vaguely aware of this, but presumed that the
  explosion was something happening on the planet, as the news that the
  remainder of their race being destroyed would have devastated them, but as
  things stand, they do not know, nor shall they be informed of the news for a
  while.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Bardock hits the floor,
  holding his bleeding nose, and shouting offensive words at Korosu, for not
  telling him that the gravity was being changed. His fellow Saiyan merely
  laughs at this, and starts to attempt to get used to the high gravity level.
  The look of excruciating pain on Korosu’s face signals that he is having a
  hard time staying on his feet, and the sweat pouring from his face adds to the
  obviousness of it. Bardock crawls over to the nearest ledge, and strains to
  pull himself up on it, squinting, and panting as he slowly gets onto his feet.
  Once he has managed the task, Bardock pushes off the ships wall, and into the
  middle of the room. He struggles to keep his balance, and stay on his feet,
  rather like someone new to roller-skating would. He turns to Korosu, who is
  struggling equally as much, and starts to stride slowly over to him, to pay
  back the damage done to his nose.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Zarbon arrives outside the
  door of a quaint house, stranded in the middle of isolated countryside. Small
  bursts of polluting smoke spew forth from the metal chimney, and fades away
  into the cold, harsh air that is about the place. A<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>deathly breeze blows as Zarbon lands, throwing his braid of hair all
  about the place, and making his cloak fly up. He breaths in the air calmly,
  reminiscent of his landing. Soon Zarbon will be king, he just has to rid
  himself of these weak peasants.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The changeling walks up to
  the front door of the house, and considers how to make his entrance. First he
  thinks about knocking politely, but quickly scraps that idea in favour of
  kicking it down, for that would be far more stylish, and would make him seem
  as if he had far more flare. Zarbon measures up the door carefully, and then
  puts such force in his kick that the door flies to the other side of the room,
  denting the wall badly. It seems to have annoyed the residents too, as one
  comes up to him, and begins to shout with all her might. Yes, it was a female,
  a lesser member of the species in Zarbon’s opinion. Why did they bother with
  them? The only use is to give birth, so why do they get equal rights? He
  neither understood, nor cared about the whole system. The female beats at his
  chest with rage, managing to hurt him quite badly, considering her
  comparatively low power level. Zarbon becomes bored with her antics though,
  and simply swats her away with the back of his hand, sending her crashing into
  a wall, making a shape similar to her body outline there. She looks at him,
  hate swelling in her eyes, but is unable to do anything.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Someone has heard all the
  commotion, and quickly comes to the females aid. Zarbon takes the scouter
  reading. This is the guy. The strongest person on a planet rumoured to contain
  some fantastic warriors, yet the power level that the scouter reads is a mere
  5,000. Zarbon looks at him in a confused way, and the man shares that stare,
  then steps forward.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Who are you? What right do
  you have to come in here, hurt my wife, and destroy my house? I’m going to
  make you pay dearly for this asshole!”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Is that meant to
  intimidate me weakling?” Zarbon chuckled. He knew that he was far superior
  in power to this lesser form of life, and he could never be beaten by such a
  weak excuse for a warrior. The man doesn’t back down though, he stands
  ready, his fists clenched, and his eyes glaring with a hatred seen very
  rarely.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Let’s settle this
  outside.” The man calmly said to Zarbon, making the changeling almost cough
  up his intestines with laughter, until he realized the fact that the man was
  serious. Zarbon looks at him in a confused way, but ends up shrugging his
  shoulders, and walking outside with a very exquisite stride. He stops just at
  the entrance of the house, and lets the man walk out.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Might I have the pleasure
  of knowing who it is that I am about to crush?” Zarbon asked mockingly.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I am Son Goku, Saiyan
  Warrior” The man replied angrily. Zarbon has a genuine look of fear on his
  face at this, not knowing how a Saiyan could come to be on Earth, or how he
  could be compassionate or have feelings for that matter. He dismisses all
  worry though, and takes Goku’s power level again, just to be sure. It soars
  up at an amazing speed as Goku begins to charge up, making his long black hair
  stick up even more than usual, and his red fighting robe begin to rip to
  shreads. Zarbon can’t believe the power of the Saiyan, as his scouter gives
  off a miniscule explosion, ceasing to work any longer. He backs off slightly,
  overcome with fear, but manages to regain his calm before his vision is
  clouded with terror. He gets himself into a fighting stance, and powers up
  himself, managing to do so very quickly, then clenches his fists, preparing to
  fight.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Let’s do this,
  monkey!” Zarbon shouts at his opponent with hatred and resentment.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The aftermath of the
  explosion of the Planet Saiya has come, and Frieza’s men have discovered no
  survivors. The man himself waits in his chamber, delicately sipping a small
  glass of red wine, and gazing out of a huge window at the shattered remains of
  a once thriving planet. He has a look of aggravation on his face, and is
  frowning intently. One of his soldiers burst through the door, and begin to
  hassle him, trying to get him to listen. Frieza turns around, looking very
  annoyed, and talking in a harsh, evil voice, full of antagonistic loathing.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“What is it soldier? Speak
  now or die!”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Master Frieza sir, I have
  been informed by the salvage crew that there was a ship flying away from the
  planet seconds before the explosion. I recommend that we pursue it.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You really think that I
  would take orders from such a benevolent, repulsive creature such as yourself?
  Leave my quarters before I kill you!” The soldier scrambles away,
  whimpering, and hoping that his life would be spared. “Ha, the fool, he is
  lucky that he caught me in a good mood! I knew that something had escaped
  though, I could sense it. I’ll have to follow this ship, because Saiyans can
  become quite powerful if left unattended for too long…</font></p>

</h3>
		  
<div class="Section1">
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Goku and Zarbon stare deeply
  into each other’s firey eyes, with neither man backing off at all. They both
  have an intensive courage in their hearts, and know that their opponent will
  not give up, whatever the circumstances. Goku steps forward, his hair blowing
  in the wind. He is glowing in yellow aura, power bursting forth from every
  orifice of his body. With one final yell, Goku charges in to attack, taking
  Zarbon completely by surprise. The changeling watches helplessly, as Goku
  rapidly advances on him, and delivers a harsh, unforgiving fist into his face,
  sending him sprawling backwards. Goku then jumps backwards, kicking Zarbon in
  the chin as he does so, and knocking him to the floor. Goku lands soon after,
  in a perfect stance, not even a bead of sweat lost. Zarbon looks, exasperated
  at the warriors strength. He sees blood drip onto his boot, and notices that
  it is green. A sudden stinging pain comes over his nose, as the pain begins to
  kick in. Blood then pours from it, like a waterfall, streaming down in huge
  loads. Zarbon realizes that his nose has been broken, and is irate. Goku
  calmly watches, in his usual fighting stance - Half crouched with his arms
  ready to block and counter if the need arises.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You stupid monkey!
  You’re going to pay for that!”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You seem to be all words,
  let’s see you put them into motion…if you’ve got the guts.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Damn you!” Zarbon
  yelled, before quickly building up a small energy ball in his hand, and
  lifting it high above his head. It glows brightly, crackling with electrical
  energy, and bulging, eventually sprouting into two semi-circles. Zarbon grins,
  then throws the energy balls at Goku, with them soaring right at him. He holds
  up his arms to block it, without any sign of worry on his face. Zarbon then
  lifts his arm, making the energy balls rise. He watches as they get to a great
  height, shielded by the suns rays. The changeling then slams his arms down,
  causing the energy to be thrown down to the ground in an upsurge of violent
  power. Goku stands motionless, not caring about how angry Zarbon is becoming.
  The attack crashes onto Goku’s head, as he stands calmly. A huge explosion
  ensues, ripping trees out of the ground, demolishing their roots, with even
  Zarbon having to cover his face with his arms. Mounds of dust, dirt and stone
  hail down upon the landscape, leaving a huge cloud of thick smoke, impossible
  to see through. The smoke slowly clears as a bitter wind blows by. The sky
  becomes a pitch black, with lightning raining down upon the battlefield. A
  silhouette begins to appear through the smoke, as Goku stands there,
  emotionless, not even emitting a single movement. A sly grin slides across
  Zarbon’s face, as he assumes that it’s over. Never assume anything.
  Although his clothes have been torn to shreds, and his skin has been ripped,
  burnt, and bruised, the Saiyan still stands tall. His face is bent over,
  looking towards the ground. Zarbon begins laughing manically, but he is
  suddenly silenced as Goku looks up at him. Lost for words, the changeling
  backs off, slowly moving away, almost completely paralysed with fear. Goku
  then reveals the full extent of the injuries to his face. Blood trickles from
  his lip, and his eye is completely bloodshot. A deep cut runs along his cheek,
  beaming with bright red flesh, infected by the smoke and stones. Goku is
  obviously in a lot of pain, but he manages to hide it well. Zarbon is
  terrified as he watches Goku wipe the cut on his lip with the back of his
  hand. After a short while of doing this, Goku starts to advance on his
  opponent, stepping gracefully, almost bouncing as his foot touches the ground.
  An deep fury fires up in his cold, heartless eyes. Thinking fast, Zarbon
  quickly roars out with a mixture of anger and pain, and starts to grow
  slightly. He transforms into some sort of beast, hideously ugly, a new
  aggression, and calmness suddenly about him. His muscles swell to an enormous
  size, as he is now about twice Goku’s size. He grins, and makes a cutting
  motion across his neck. Still though, Goku continues to advance, not even
  hesitating upon the transformation.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Just so you know, this
  form doesn’t just make me look more intimidating, it also increases my
  strength” Zarbon boasted.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“So? Even if it made you
  twice as strong I could still beat you easily. In fact, even if you were a
  hundred times stronger, you’d still be no match for me. I haven’t even
  begun to use the full extent of my power!” Goku replied confidently.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Maybe you could become
  slightly stronger, maybe 2, 3, 5 times at the most, but I have improved no
  end, and you will see that as I crush you easily weasel!”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“We’ll see. We’ll
  see.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yes, we will, now prepare
  to die monkey! You have agitated me long enough!” Zarbon roared as he flew
  in with impressive speed, and held back his fist, ready to punch a hole right
  through Goku. The Saiyan doesn’t move at all though, and stands there,
  awaiting the attack. Mere fractions of a second before Zarbon can make any
  sort of contact with Goku, his fist is caught, with on hand. The changeling
  can’t believe that anyone could be so fast as to get their arm up with such
  swiftness, but Goku has managed it. He begins to tighten his grip, crushing
  the clenched fists of his enemy. Zarbon pleads for forgiveness, begging for
  mercy, asking to be let off.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Please! Let go! I’ll
  leave this place and never return! I’m sorry! Let me live! Please, I beg of
  you! Show mercy!” Zarbon screamed agonizingly. Goku’s compassionate heart
  starts to kick in, making him loosen his grip just slightly, but enough for
  Zarbon to capitalize. The changeling jerks his fist away from Goku’s
  formerly rigid grip, then buries it deep into the Saiyans gut. Goku’s eyes
  narrow, his pupils almost disappear, and he begins to desperately gasp for
  air. The calm coolness has gone, and a state of panic has hit in. Zarbon is
  laughing, standing proudly over Goku, trying to look intimidating.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You fool! I was insincere
  in that apology! I say sorry to no one! I am Zarbon, supreme, and rightful
  ruler of the galaxy! The strongest warrior in the world! And you…a mere
  Saiyan… a sympathetic Saiyan. That’s a first! Well, you’re kindness
  shall be your undoing!” Zarbon laughed, as he raised one arm, with a
  clenched fist. Goku continues clutching his stomach in agony. He falls to one
  knee, pain overcoming all other emotions, controlling his face, as he squints
  hard, gritting his teeth, trying to take the horrific agony. He looks up to
  Zarbon, his eyes swelling, almost asking for mercy. Zarbon answers this by
  spitting in the Saiyans face, thinking it hilarious. Goku wipes the mucus from
  his face, then his eyes suddenly become huge, and he emits a large load of
  blood from his mouth. It pours out, staining the ground with the casualty of a
  brave warrior. It seems as though it is all over for Goku, as his face hits
  the floor. Zarbon laughs, then brings down his fist, aiming for Goku’s face.
  The Saiyan looks on helplessly, ready to accept death. The fist closes in, and
  Goku shuts his eyes. A few seconds later, Goku still isn’t dead. He opens
  one of his eyes, as it hurts him to do so, and he sees a human hand in front
  of his face, shaking wildly. Goku helplessly stares up at the arm, tracing it
  along for the source. At the top of the arm is a shoulder, with a red training
  uniform draped over it, not too different to Goku’s. The Saiyan continues to
  pan his eyes up the figure, and sees a bald head.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Krillen!” he said
  excitedly.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I’m here for you bro.
  Now get up and help me up!” Krillen answered, with a beaming smile. Goku
  strains to get up, but does so in the end, one half of his body hanging
  limply, as he struggles to stay on his feet. His vision has been impaired by
  the pain, as he sees double of Zarbon. Krillen is pushed backwards onto the
  floor by Zarbon’s overwhelming strength. The little man slides along,
  skimming across the ground, before doing a backflip, and landing on his feet.
  He looks up to Zarbon, cruel intent in his heart, ready to cause suffering to
  him. Zarbon relaxes a bit, and begins laughing.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Two weaklings to defeat,
  add to my accomplishments. I’ll give you both one chance to join me in a
  rebellion against Frieza before I finish you off.” Silence. “So be it.
  Prepare to die!”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Krillen! Go! Leave now!
  He’s too powerful for you! I appreciate you being here, but you wont be able
  to do much to help, and he’ll probably destroy you easily!” Goku pleaded.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I’m not leaving you bro!
  Look at you, you<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>can hardly stand
  on your own accord!” Krillen said sympathetically.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Well? You going to fight
  or not you fools? A battered monkey and a bald-headed goon. What fun!”
  Zarbon laughed.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Add a Namek to that
  equation!” said a deep voice, seemingly evil, and chilling.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yeah, and another
  Saiyan!” said someone else, from the same general direction as the Namek.
  The Saiyans voice was slightly high pitched, like that of a small child.
  Zarbon turns round swiftly to see a tall, young Namek, and a short boy,
  obviously cared for too much by an overprotective mother, because of his hair
  gelled down like a nerds.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Piccolo! Gohan!” Krillen
  shouted excitedly.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You two look like you
  could use some help” Piccolo smirked.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“This guys strong, be
  careful Piccolo. He’s already got Goku hurt bad.” Krillen said, in a
  concerned manor.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“His weakness lies in his
  speed!” Goku shouted. “He may be strong and powerful, but he has
  sacrificed his speed to get there”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Thanks Goku, that’ll
  come in useful” Piccolo commented. “Now come on Zarbon, lets go help them
  out.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“What? Four-on-one?
  That’s hardly fair is it?” Zarbon said weakly. “At least have the guts
  to fight me one-on-one.” There is a short pause after this while everyone
  decides on what they will do. Zarbon takes this opportunity, and fires a
  penetrating ball of intensive energy straight at Krillen’s chest, hitting
  him directly. The explosion rebounded and spread, hitting everyone, knocking
  them all to the ground.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Oh sorry, I thought we had
  started already” Zarbon laughed, sadistically, manically, evilly. Krillen
  lies on the floor, smoke rising from his chest. He is barely hanging on to his
  life. Gohan and Goku were also hurt by the blast, as they were knocked
  backwards, with Gohan injuring his shoulder badly, and Goku becoming even more
  roughed up. Neither can get back to their feet, leaving Piccolo alone to fight
  Zarbon.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Looks like it is just us
  two then Namek” Zarbon observed.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“It seems that your
  intelligence matches your cowardice then. Attacking from behind is the worse
  thing that anyone could ever do you coward! Now I will avenge them! But not
  here…follow me to a suitable fighting place. There is no sense in these
  people getting injured any worse.” Piccolo responded.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Lead the way Namek”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Zarbon said calmly, as Piccolo flies off. He pursues, staying only a
  few metres away. Piccolo seems to evaporate all of a sudden, and Zarbon knows
  that he has landed. He then drops down from the sky, setting down on the
  floor. Hills litter the landscape, with thriving trees, and prosperous plants.
  The fight is soon to begin. Can Piccolo avenge Goku? Can he do what the Saiyan
  did? Will he become another victim to Zarbon’s trickery?</font></p>

<div class="Section1">
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Zarbon and Piccolo stare at
  one another, with a harsh breeze blowing into them, with dust being propelled
  into the air. It rises high, but its altitude quickly drops. Like a flash of
  lightning, Piccolo flies in, and buries a fist into Zarbon’s face, sending
  him staggering backwards. Piccolo then soars in, and attempts to attack again,
  but Zarbon is alert as always, and manages to bury his elbow into Piccolo’s
  face, following it up with a kick in his chin. Piccolo’s head is almost
  knocked clean off, and he is sent backflipping over, landing awkwardly. He
  lies on the floor, a crippled heap, unable to move, contemplating what to do
  in this provisionally tragic situation. Zarbon becomes closer, starting to get
  battle fatigue, as his vision begins to become weary that his opponent may be
  more formidable than he first thought, after the epic encounter with Goku took
  an awful lot out of him. Zarbon towers above Piccolo, ready to attempt to
  finish him off, when suddenly, Piccolo gets a burst of life, sweeping the
  changelings legs, then kicking him as he falls, sending him shooting across
  the floor, skimming a few times before coming to a stop.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The sun beams down brightly,
  with blindingly dazzling light being emitted from it, lighting up one of the
  greatest battles that anyone is ever likely to witness. Piccolo lies on the
  floor, bleeding in the mouth, his gruesome, purple blood trickling down his
  pointed chin. Struggling to his feet, he tries his utmost best to focus.
  Somehow, no matter what he does, Zarbon keeps getting up.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“This is looking bad, but
  never mind, I can win, I have heart and spirit. He looks pretty worn down from
  fighting Goku too, he must have used some pretty big attacks.” Piccolo
  commented to himself.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Very perceptive Namek”
  Zarbon answered fiercely. “That was a devious trick you used on me, but I
  won’t fall for anything like that again! You fool; you really think that you
  can win? I am quite simply, infinitely stronger than you!” Zarbon flips up
  to his feet, and stares Piccolo down for a while. Trying to gaze a hole right
  through the Namekian’s chest, evilly looking on, intense hatred starting to
  formulate in his bitter eyes. Zarbon powers up slightly, then charges at
  Piccolo, laughing manically, pain the only thing on his mind.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Let’s do this then you
  ugly bitch!” Piccolo cried out, before preparing for the onslaught. Zarbon
  swings at him, intent on simply making contact for the time being, hitting
  Piccolo ferociously in the cheek, and knocking him backwards a little.
  Following up, Zarbon aims for the Namek’s cheek once again, but this time
  Piccolo gets his guard up, blocking the punch, then delivering a kick into his
  enemies stomach. Zarbon falls to one knee, looking up in agony.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You’re going to pay for
  that bastard!”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Doesn’t look like
  you’re in the position to make threats, friend.” Piccolo scoffed.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Damn you!” Zarbon
  screamed, shooting a KI blast of awesome power, and intensive energy straight
  at Piccolo, sending him soaring deeply into the sky. Of course, when one
  attempts an energy beam when on one knee, it is impossible to gather the
  energy required to keep up its momentum, thus allowing Piccolo to roll
  smoothly off the beam. The Namek crashes down to the ground hard, bouncing at
  least a foot upon impact, and cringing up his face in pain, biting his lip to
  try to prevent it, but unsuccessfully.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Meanwhile, in the depths of
  space, Korosu and Bardock are hard at work training. They are sparring with
  one another, now used to the high gravity level, and moving at a similar pace
  to what they would do at the normal gravity for their planet…or at least
  their former planet. Now that Frieza has destroyed it, they have no place to
  live, no friends or family left, they are the last surviving Saiyans, assuming
  the ones on Earth are just stains in the pattern of mythology.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Korosu sits, pondering over
  this, what about if their journey to Earth was in vain? Still, at least they
  were getting stronger. It will be about a day before they arrive on Earth, due
  to the high speed of their craft. Little to they know that they are going to
  miss out on much of the action.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Bardock wonders aimlessly
  over to Korosu, and collapses down by him, breathing heavily. Both have been
  pushing themselves to the limit, and are dripping with sweat, and aching in
  every single limb. Neither man can put up a real resistance against the power
  of the gravity now, in their exhausted state, but Korosu has the motivation to
  get up, as Frieza begins travelling around his mind, taunting him. Turning the
  dial up to full, Korosu looks at the small display, seeing the figure
  ‘100’. Immediately he is dragged down, slamming his face down hard against
  the floor, and falling into a state of unconsciousness.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Whilst he is in this state,
  thoughts begin to interweave themselves in his mind, slowly forming up an
  representation, an icon, an image of the one he is after. A planet…fairly
  prosperous, dark, but thriving with people states its daily business, before a
  beam comes hammering down from the space, destroying the planet. Otaku screams
  benevolently, crying out in pain, whilst the other Saiyans grip tightly onto
  one another, as a bright beam cuts into the planet, before slicing it into
  two, and causing it to implode. A persons face comes over the planet, laughing
  hysterically, evilly, like a psychopath. The face is blurry at first, but
  slowly comes into focus. The familiar horns, the purple lips, the pale white,
  remorseless face, and the purple helm, on which the horns are mounted. It’s
  Frieza, the eternal enemy of the Saiyans. He was the cause of the destruction
  of their home planet, he was the one who must be punished, it is he who shall
  suffer a fate worse than death.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Voices introduce themselves
  into the vision. One stands out above the rest. It is a compassionate, yet
  strict, strong voice. It is oh so recognisable, coming from the mouth of
  Otaku, a great friend of Korosu.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Listen child, our race has
  been destroyed, but Frieza holds the legacy of our people. The legacy, of you,
  Korosu. You must defeat him in battle, and take it from his very hand. Only
  then will your purpose of existence be fulfilled. First though, travel to
  Earth and meet with a Saiyan named Goku. He will be able to assist you for a
  short time, in teaching you new techniques, but his training prowess is
  limited. Take care, and be careful child. Don’t forget Korosu, it is your
  legacy, you must claim it one day…” With that, the voice slowly trails
  off, leaving Korosu clenching his fists tightly, cursing Frieza vividly, not
  realizing that his consciousness has been regained. Bardock stands over him,
  with a wet flannel, happy that his friend is in good condition. Pushing
  Bardock aside, Korosu immediately gets back to training, struggling to move in
  the hazardous conditions, but doing so all the same, due to sheer
  determination, and will-power, along with an added dose of hatred for Frieza.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Zarbon stands over Piccolo,
  laughing frenziedly, with an insane look in his eye. He raises his hand to
  strike, in an effort to finish off his opponent, but still the Namek isn’t
  done. He opens his mouth wide, them lets out a roaring beam from it, catching
  the huge monster right in the face, and sending him diving backwards,
  screaming with pain, holding his smoldering face, as black patches appear all
  over it, and smoke rises from it intensively. Piccolo tries to keep his mouth
  open, but he has suffered too much of a beating to do so. His opponent is
  obviously a very powerful warrior, who turned out to be too dominant for him.
  With a short gasp, Piccolo fades away into unconsciousness, barely hanging
  onto his life. Zarbon gets back up to his feet, weakly, and stands over
  Piccolo once more, then holds both arms in the air. Slowly, energy gathers,
  and builds up, becoming greater, and greater all the time. It reaches an
  enormous size, with Piccolo defenseless to do anything about it. Zarbon throws
  down the energy, but before it hits, it is intercepted by a far more powerful
  energy beam, coming from directly in front of him. The beam knocks Zarbon’s
  own attack right into his chest, knocking him backwards, and making him land
  flat on his back, in agony, with even more smoke rising from him.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">On the horizon stands a
  silhouette of a figure, panting euphorically, and holding his arms limply by
  his sides after all the energy used. He clenches his fist, roars, then charges
  forwards…</font></p>

14 - The Battle's Conclusion</font></span>
</h3>
		  
<div class="Section1">
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The figure subtly strides
  forwards, with the extensive light of the sun revealing him. He has a
  screaming graze on the side of his face, with the deep red of it shining
  prominently in the light. A large bruise suffocates the other side of his
  face, almost overwhelming in appearance. Both of his eyes have streaks of red
  lines inside, signaling the pain, and anger that this guy is going through.
  They are completely bloodshot, and it is obvious the figure is having trouble
  seeing straight. His resentment towards Zarbon overpowers him, as his stride
  becomes larger, and his walk gradually turns into a run. Finally he is
  completely revealed.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Zarbon looks up to see where
  this awesome power came from, and is in disbelief upon seeing it’s source.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“A…a…kid?” He asks,
  completely confused, and oblivious to the incredible power that this ‘kid’
  possesses. He rises to his feet, and attempts to shake off the agony. He is
  covered in cuts, bruises, and dirt from the ongoing battles that he has been
  competing in.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You leave Mr Piccolo
  alone!” The kid yells out loudly, somehow managing to intimidate the monster
  of a man that Zarbon is.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">‘Damn, I’m too badly hurt
  to beat this kid’ Zarbon ponders to himself, contemplating the situation.
  ‘I have to fight back though!’ Zarbon brushes his braid of green hair
  back, and clenches his fist, ready to fight. The ‘kid’ reaches him, and
  headbutts him directly in the stomach, before the Changeling can even throw a
  punch. Zarbon’s eyes swell, and blood slowly gushes from his mouth. He gasps
  for air, but can retrieve none. Slowly, he drops to the floor, shaking only
  occasionally because of the crushing pain succumbing him. “Who…who are
  you?” He managed to say weakly, clinging onto his consciousness by a thread.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I am Gohan, son of Goku!
  Trained by the great Piccolo!” The kid replied proudly, yet harshly and
  abruptedly.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You are the offspring of
  that weak individual monkey that I beat? And that Namek trained such a
  powerful warrior? How can a human be so strong?” Zarbon deliberated out
  loud. “What the…?!” He said, totally bemused as to what he saw in front
  of him. From out of the kids slightly baggy trousers waves a brown, furry
  tail, swinging contently. ‘How could a Saiyan make it here before I?’
  Zarbon wondered. ‘And I never heard of such a strong monkey either!’</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“How dare you! You hurt my
  father and my friends, now it is your end!” Gohan shouted, with such rage
  that Zarbon knew it would be best to cover his face with his forearms. “Take
  this you evil bully!” The ‘kid’ screamed as he let rip with a Masenko of
  such power, that not only did it drive Zarbon down through countless layers of
  Earth, but it also blew all surroundings into a crisp, flaming wreck. The
  blast had such intensive power that it blew even Gohan backwards, making him
  hit his head incredibly hard against a stray rock, and slowly fade out of
  consciousness.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Korosu and Bardock always
  trained intensively, but it was rare for them to be pushing themselves this
  hard, past their limit, and then some. Huge beads of sweat pour down their
  bruised brow, as they spar with one another, hitting hard, and moving at
  incredible rates. They fly around the ship, causing occasional dents to it
  when stray punches were landed. Korosu dances around, dodging all that Bardock
  has to offer, then gives some back. The dial remains at 100 times the planet
  Saiya’s gravity, as the machine begins to shake from the pure strain of the
  battle. It nears explosion, just as Bardock notices this out of the corner of
  his eye, and moves with an urgent sense of speed about him, to turn it down a
  notch, to 50 times the gravity of their former homepanet.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Whoa, we really went all
  out this time, didn’t we Korosu!” Bardock panted, desperately breathing
  for air. No reply emits itself from the mouth of the powerful, cold, hard
  warrior though, as he sits on the floor, a look of grief on his face. A
  transparent tear slowly jerks down his wounded cheek, mixing in with the blood
  to cause a red tear, which drips to the floor, splashing intently onto
  Korosu’s clothes. More come down, slowly making the small splash gather into
  a fairly wide puddle, with a diameter of around a centimetre.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Korosu?” Bardock asked
  quietly, worried about his friend. “Are you hurt? I wouldn’t be surprised,
  we trained flat out…”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“No.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Can I help you at all?”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“No.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Ok. You want anything to
  eat?”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“No.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Come on, something’s up.
  The Korosu I know wouldn’t get this upset over pain, is it someone you know?
  Something happened?” Bardock questioned interrogatingly, with a concerned
  tone to his voice.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Otaku. He was killed under
  that bastard Frieza’s order. I had a vision of some kind with him in. He
  said to meet with a man named Goku on Earth. I remembered how he was killed,
  that’s all.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Oh…he must have been a
  good friend.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“He was, in the short time
  that I knew him…there was something else too, something far more
  important.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Tell me.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Our planet was
  destroyed”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I know, I could somehow
  sense it, it’s what has been driving me through this agonizing training.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“There’s more. Our planet
  was destroyed by the heartless bastard – Frieza.” Korosu said,
  sympathetically. Bardock could give no answer to this though, silently being
  overcome with hatred, his rage building. He clenches his fist, and roars
  diligently.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“That bastard! How could he
  do such a thing?!”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I know...we must make him
  pay, we must defeat him, to avenge all the Saiyans that he murdered
  ruthlessly! But first, we must meet up with this Goku character.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“This vision…I don’t
  know why, but I completely believe you about it…” Bardock said, confused.
  Before any explanation could be given though, a bleeping sound begins to drone
  around the ship. A small monitor comes up, and a voice announces that they are
  passing a planet named Yardrat. The voice says that this planet has much to
  other in the way of resources, and that the people know many skills. A brief
  pause ensues, before the silence is filled with the voice broadcasting the
  fact that it should only be about 18 more hours until their arrival on Earth.
  Korosu moves to the ships controls, and keys in some new co-ordinates, to set
  the raging ship down on the tender surface of Yardrat.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“We could learn more
  techniques, get a new insight on training from these people. Their planet is
  insufficient to fill our desires, we don’t need it.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I know. I feel the
  same.” Bardock replied positively. Best change into a suit of armour that
  isn’t completely tattered and broken so that I can look my best…</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">A large ship sails across the
  cosmos, soaring contentedly past the stars and planets, at would be an
  incredible speed for most ships, but for this one, it is only a fraction of
  its fastest. The crew members are brooding in fear of their master, knowing
  that if they don’t find that ship soon, then agonizing pain will be in their
  future.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">A short alien, with large
  eyes, and a slightly pointy-head walks into the main quarters, and stands
  rigidly for a few seconds, awaiting his masters permission to speak. His
  master is an evil man, full of hatred, loathing, and resentment towards all
  living things. He stands, looking out of the dome windows of his epic carrier,
  sipping red wine from a glass in an elegant manner. He swills the glass around
  a little, then places it on a small table. He arrogantly turns round to face
  the soldier, and mutters something about stupid monkeys.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Speak now soldier!” The
  being shouted to the soldier with the unyielding stance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Master Frieza” started
  the soldier “It has come to our attention that we have weapons powerful
  enough to destroy the craft of Saiyans.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I know that. Now if you
  don’t tell me something useful in the next 5 seconds, I am going to kill
  you” hissed the soldiers master – Frieza.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Well, we have located the
  Saiyans ship, and we could take them out whenever you give the order.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I want the pleasure of
  ripping their vile, despicable heads clean off their necks myself. Therefore,
  I must approach these lowlifes in person. One blast isn’t going to cause
  them sufficient pain. Besides, compared to me they are completely
  insignificant. They may get more powerful if we leave them for a day, but not
  powerful enough. Tell me, where are they heading!?”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“To a blue planet named
  Earth sir. We could reach it in approximately 5 hours…” Before he can give
  any further advice, his green scouter begins to blink, and a fuzzy
  transmission comes in, with him listening to it carefully, and nodding every
  few seconds, with full interest and attention diverted to it.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Is there a problem?”
  Frieza bellowed hoarsely.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“No sir, far from it. We
  could intercept their ship and kill them on a closer planet, as they have
  changed their course. The scientists monitoring their path have discovered
  that they are going to a planet named Yardrat for some reason.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Hmm…a good chance to
  kill them. Let’s converse with them for a while on the planet, then we’ll
  see if they can escape my wrath a second time! If they get away though
  soldier, it shall be your life taken. I am putting you in charge with full
  responsibility of all that happens. If we don’t find them, then you are a
  dead man!”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yes…sir.” The soldier
  said, before turning, and hastily sprinting out of Frieza’s quarters.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yes…I can see their
  terrified faces now. There has to be a reason that they are running off to
  Earth though. Maybe that planet possesses some sort of power, or powerful
  beings…maybe, just maybe. I’ll extract the information from them on
  Yardrat anyway. We’ll soon find out” Frieza sneered evilly. 2We’ll get
  there before them, and then I shall complete the job of exterminating the
  whole Saiyan race!”</font></p>

<div class="Section1">
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">An isolated ship nears the
  atmosphere of a beautiful planet, floating in space peacefully, with no cares
  to what is happening between conflicting, destructive, power-hungry races. The
  inhabitants of this planet are all good people, kind-hearted, loving, caring
  towards every living thing, and fantastic hosts, who know how to organise
  parties. Their downside is their primitive technology, and basic combat
  skills. As they are peaceful, none of them know how to fight, meaning that
  they will be destroyed if battle ever erupts on the quiet planet. These people
  live on Yardrat.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">As the ship nears its
  destination, frantic movement ensues from inside. Two Saiyans are desperately
  looking at a screen in terror. It seems to be two blinking dots, and a
  darkened round dot, far bigger then the other two comparatively miniscule
  specs.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Shit, Bardock, that’s
  Frieza’s ship!”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I know, calm down Korosu,
  we’ll be able to get out of this one.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The two Saiyans were the
  victors of many a battle, the ones who destroyed Dodoria, and two of the very
  few survivors in an almost extinct race. Bardock and Korosu’s training had
  led them on the path to achieving ultimate power, but they weren’t there
  yet, not by a long way.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Thoughts spun through
  Korosu’s mind, frantically making his head spin, and giving him a queasy and
  groggy feeling. Bowing his head, he knows what he must do.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“We have to fight them,
  there is no other option”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“What? Have you gone
  completely mad? We can’t beat Frieza yet!” Bardock protested valiantly.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You don’t have to come,
  I’ll lure him away, and you go to Earth.” Korosu replied in a callous
  manner.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“No, it would be insane to
  leave you alone against Frieza, especially with your unpredictable nature.
  I’m staying, and I’ll take Frieza on too!”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Korosu smiles at Bardock
  gleefully, as his eyes swell with a strange ferociousness, filling with white,
  almost completely making the pupils disappear. “I can take these bastards on
  Bardock, Frieza isn’t as strong as you think. I’ve heard rumours that his
  power is at around 500,000 maximum. I know I can win.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You’re strong, and
  brave, hell, you don’t even fear death, but I have a bad feeling about this,
  he is well over twice as strong as you.” Bardock argued.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I don’t care. My
  technique is impeccable, I’m the strongest Saiyan alive, and I will avenge
  all of my people killed by that bastard!” Korosu sneered.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“But…”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“No buts Bardock. Listen,
  friend, I am going to do this, and if I don’t make it, then you can get to
  Son Goku. It’s the best way. If you still don’t agree, then I suppose
  there’s only one thing left to do”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“What’s that?”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Kill you”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“What?!”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Sorry Bardock, but if you
  disagree, I’m going to have to end your life”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You’re power is about
  the same as mine, you’d have to fight me hard to kill me”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I don’t care. Go or
  die.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“I have no choice. Good
  luck Korosu. I’ll land, then you can distract them while I go to Earth to
  find Goku.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Thank you, I appreciate it
  Bardock.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Anyway, Earth sounds
  familiar…I don’t know why…”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You’ll find out soon.”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The ship lands, and Korosu
  quickly springs out, and prepares for the imminent arrival of Frieza.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“GO, NOW!” Korosu
  screamed, as Bardock obediently obeyed his superior, knowing that Korosu was
  stronger than him, and he was determined to do this. As Bardock set off,
  Frieza began to land, but diverted his attention temporarily, contemplating on
  whether or not to go after the fleeing ship. Seeing what was happening, Korosu
  quickly launched a massive KI blast towards the windows of the cruiser,
  smashing them instantly. A couple of soldiers could be seen being sucked out
  into the depths of space, falling victims to the eternal loneliness that it
  gives away to anyone unlucky enough to fall stray without a ship or a line.
  The soldiers were wearing helmets allowing them to breathe, so maybe they had
  a chance of drifting onto some colonized planet, and being nursed back to
  health. The chances were minimal though, and besides, they were insignificant
  when compared to the would-be ruler of the universe, Frieza. Korosu was
  waiting for one man to exit the ship, and eventually he did.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">It was an incredible sight,
  as Frieza put one of his clawed feet outside the ship, then took another one,
  and pushed away off the side. Before he could drift, he let off a seemingly
  effortless KI blast, allowing him to be shot onto the planets surface. Korosu
  could feel the intensity of the energy given off by Frieza’s mere presence,
  and it was then that he realized that he was only trying to fool himself, and
  there was no chance of victory. Frieza approached the pesky Saiyan with a
  menacing look on his face, obviously ready to cause a great deal of damage.</font></p>
  <p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><font size="2" face="Arial">*********</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">The dusty ground of a
  battlefield on Earth grows dark, as the sun takes a breath and heads down for
  the night. A cold breezy chill spreads its way across what was once an epic
  battle, but is now only a collection of motionless bodies. Lying next to each
  other are Gohan, Krillen, and Piccolo, all completely drained of their energy
  after the fight. The body that seems to be missing though is that of the
  awesomely powerful Goku, who mysteriously seemed to disappear halfway during
  the fight, upon Zarbon tricking him, taking advantage of his naïve ways, and
  taking him out of commission. Using all of his energy, Gohan pulls himself to
  his feet, and begins to stagger towards a few of the many craters that
  littered the ground. His shadow shakes, barely visible now, and his eyes are
  half shut. He is obviously having trouble seeing, and walking due to the
  extent of his injuries, but he continues to walk on all the same.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Suddenly, a ray of light
  brightened up Gohan’s dull mood. He looked up to see his father lying on the
  floor, the top half of his GI torn, and covered in all sorts of cuts and
  bruises. With one swift jump, Gohan is bearing over his dad, grinning
  intensively. Goku smiles back, before his son collapsed on him, completely
  drained from the day’s activities.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Well done Gohan, you’ve
  done well. I’m proud of you son” Goku said to his apparently unconscious
  son. Just as he begins to drift off himself, a huge noise emits itself from
  his left. It seems like a loud engine, which is followed by shouting. A smile
  wafts itself across the Saiyans face, as he realizes that Roshi is here, to
  help them all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<div class="Section1">
  <p class="MsoNormal">A callous, harsh wind blows across the dusty surface of
  Yardrat, as small aliens run away from the horrors of the battlefield. The
  heavily armored Korosu stands tall, not backing down at all, a confident smirk
  on his face, a mere mask covering up his real feelings. Many conflicting
  emotions scuttle through his complex mind, as complicated mathematical
  equations are figured out in his head, attempting to discover his chances of
  victory. Deciding on just stalling the fight for a while, Korosu tenses his
  muscles, cranks his neck, then begins to slowly stretch.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"What do you think you're doing monkey?" Frieza
  questioned maliciously, smiling vividly with his malevolent purple lips, as a
  deep, intimidating stare is emitted right into Korosu's fearful eyes.
  "Well? Answer me!" The evil one bellowed impatiently.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"I am not a monkey" was Korosu's simple reply.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"You look like it to me. Anyway, I have destroyed the
  rest of your primitive species; they didn't put up much of a fight. Rather
  funny actually, they didn't even manage to inflict any pain at all on me."</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"Shut up. You had my friend Otaku killed, you had my
  people killed, and now I'm going to kill you."</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"Is that what you think you uncultured ruffian? We'll
  see won't we? Now attack me, and fail miserably like your pathetic friend
  did against my demeaning soldiers. He was weak, just like you!" Frieza
  laughed, angering Korosu massively, making him shake with rage, and grind his
  teeth viciously. Bowing his head, he continues to shake furiously, before
  finally jerking it up hastily, and roaring out with an incredible cry of rage.
  A huge aura of blue light surrounds him, turning into red, and then yellow,
  before soaring across the battlefield, and destroying pretty much every object
  in its path, including the vast majority of Frieza's soldiers, leaving only
  the more powerful ones. Glowing brightly, Korosu charges forward at Frieza, a
  tear streaming from his eye as he screams loudly at the laughing Frieza, who
  is enjoying the moment emphatically.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"Bastard! You're going down for what you did to Otaku
  and the rest of my friends!" Korosu barked, as he swings his fist right at
  Frieza's head, the only thought on his mind is to inflict serious damage to
  the evil being, and impair severe physical agony to every part of his body.
  Frieza takes the punch face on, without even attempting to block it, allowing
  it to smash him right in the cheek. Korosu buries his fist deep into his
  opponents face, but after a couple of seconds he realizes that he hasn't
  even caused a minute amount of pain. Frieza smiles, then grabs Korosu by the
  arm, and throws him high into the air. To follow up the throw, the evil one
  uses unbelievable speed to fly into the path of Korosu's flight,
  intercepting him and slamming him down powerfully to the dusty, durable
  ground, causing a large crater. Blood is spewed forth from Korosu's mouth,
  as he tries to regain some sort of composure, as pain runs through his body,
  destroying many of his senses and instincts. Knowing that he wasn't going to
  win by conventional methods, the Saiyan crawled back to his feet, and
  staggered right up to the face of Frieza, in a futile effort to intimidate the
  monstrous being.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"You want to know a secret?" Frieza asked intently.
  Korosu didn't answer, but merely grunted with annoyance, desperately trying
  to think of a way of executing some sort of victory. "This isn't my
  strongest form. It isn't even a tenth of my power!"</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"I don't care bastard! Now die!" Korosu yelled,
  charging up an energy beam, then shooting it contently into Frieza's eye.
  With amazing swiftness and reflexes, the laser-like attack was seized with a
  short, sharp counter eye beam from Frieza, disintegrating it immediately.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Korosu began to realize the extent of the trouble he was
  in. That was one of his most powerful attacks, and Frieza effortless, and
  successfully countered it with what looked like a mediocre beam.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"Please monkey, you can't win with such cheap shots.
  I'm growing impatient now, so don't think me rude as I kill you!"</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"Give it your best shot asshole" Korosu stammered,
  his fear beginning to get the better of him.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"You asked for it" Frieza chuckled, before launching
  a massive elbow to the defenseless Saiyans head, and sending him shooting into
  a cluster of nearby rocks, making them collapse under the pressure. To follow
  through what seemed like an graceful, undemanding attack, Frieza held out one
  finger, and shot a beam out of it, similar to the one Korosu used earlier. It
  headed directly into the huddle of rocks where Korosu lay, and exploded on
  impact, causing a huge chunk to be blown out of the planet, and mass
  devastation to be caused. Smiling at a job well done, Frieza turned his back
  to leave, but his strides were disturbed by a feeble figure barely managing to
  push a small rock off his body, then his leg. A head poked out of the rubble,
  covered in blood, bruises, and scratches, and very vague in appearance after
  the damage it's suffered. The beating that the face has taken has made it so
  unrecognizable, that it isn't until the injured humanoid stands up that
  Frieza realizes who it is.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"You have a tail? Don't say you're the monkey I
  just beat up?"</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"I may not look like my usual self, but believe me, I
  am going to beat you Freiza" Korosu sneered.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"I must commend you on surviving such an attack monkey,
  not many would have done. I thought you was just someone who had been washed
  into the explosion, but I guess I was wrong."</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"You'll never kill me bastard!" Korosu replied
  weakly, barely able to stand of his own accord.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"I beg to differ" Frieza countered, charging forward,
  then using insane speed to kick Korosu in the face before he even knew what
  had happened. The Saiyan went shooting backwards a few metres, skidding across
  the floor, with blood streaming from his nose and lip, and his forehead gashed
  open badly. "Finally, you're dead"</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"Don't…be too…sure…Frieza" Korosu managed to
  stammer, still on the floor. Even though his vision is badly impaired, the
  resilient Saiyan climbed to his feet, and stood limply, holding his arm. 'I
  don't believe how powerful this guy is!' Korosu contemplated to himself.
  'His speed is undetectable! I was a fool to even think I could beat him!
  This isn't even the bulk of his strength…I can't see myself getting out
  of this alive. Time to use my most powerful attack, it'll drain me of all my
  energy, but it might be enough to stop that maniac'.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"You're still alive?"</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"Damn right Frieza, and now your time has come…Now
  watch closely, this is the attack that killed that fat pink alien –
  Dodoria…"</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"He was a weakling anyway, just like you"</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"I'm not weak! Now take this! KEN…SHOU!" The
  Saiyan yelled, letting off a mammoth blast, consisting of a blue energy beam
  with a paler shade of it spiralling round, with the attack moving at a
  ludicrously fast pace, exploding and causing a blast radius of about a mile
  upon impact. Korosu lies on the floor as smoke immerses the whole place,
  totally drained of all energy, and in overwhelming agony after suffering a lot
  of pain from the backlash of the blast. He looks up to see if the fight really
  is over. The smoke begins to disappear into the icy, bitter air, leaving a
  prominent silhouette, standing, not having moved from the spot that it stood
  last. "But…but how?" Korosu pondered out loud.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">"I told you monkey" the silhouette started "You
  can't beat me". The shadow became a person as the smoke completely
  cleared, revealing Frieza, looking extremely angry, covered in his own blood.
  "I must admit, you gave me quite a scare then, I thought maybe you'd even
  cause me some serious damage, but of course your just a primate, so little can
  be done by you to avoid your weak fighting skills, and lack of discipline.
  It's a shame; you could have been a good soldier if I didn't have to kill
  you.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">'Shit…I can't move' Korosu thought to himself,
  desperately trying to think of a way out of his inescapable situation. Frieza
  towers over him aggressively, ready to deliver the fatal blow.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">***</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Goku exercises outside his country home, punching the
  air, and trying to kick faster than humanly possible, and needless to say, he
  was easily accomplishing it. Gohan is also training, copying his dads every
  move, and becoming stronger by the minute. After the sensu's they were fed
  on Roshi's ship, it appears that they are fully back to health. Gohan is
  obviously, and apparently far stronger, as is Goku, with both of them having
  power unheard of by any human. All seems well and quiet, as they go about
  their daily business, unaware of the fact that they are soon to meet up with
  the remaining survivors of a once prosperous race. If they did know though, it
  would just take away the happy surprise that Goku would get now, wouldn't
  it, meeting his father for the first time and all. This will all be an unread
  chapter in the book of life if Bardock and Korosu cannot make it though, with
  their survival being essential for the fate of mankind.</p>

</h3>
		  
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">With an angry grimace, Frieza prepares to deliver
the final blow to the Saiyan. He viciously grabs him by the scruff of the neck,
and picks him high into the air meeting his horrific gaze.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Goodbye monkey” Frieza laughs maliciously as
he pulls back his arm, preparing to finish his opponent off. Deciding to take
the defeat like a man, Korosu doesn’t squirm or wriggle, as it will do him no
good, he merely closes his eyes and awaits his destiny.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">After a few seconds, Korosu realizes that he
hasn’t yet felt any pain from the blow, and he is still alive. Curiously
opening his right eye, the Saiyan looks towards his arch-rival to see that his
fist is seemingly suspended in the air. Frieza is grunting with effort as he
attempts to pull his fist forward and finish Korosu off. The Saiyan’s eyes
widen, and he is overcome with absolute fear as his time draws near. Only a few
more seconds now before the evil tyrant kills him, and Korosu starts to regret
all the pain, suffering and misery that he caused in the early days of his life
to the diminutive races scattered around the galaxy. He did all this to please
the evil creature who is preparing to kill him now, his hard work just ignored
as this despicable and wretched being roars out as he pulls against the
apparently invisible strain.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Suddenly Korosu notices it, the thing that Frieza
is battling to move his fist with, it is a small white glove wrapped around the
muscular pink-purple arm of the tyrant. It is that of a humanoid figure who
obviously has immense power. Grunting can now be heard from behind Frieza, as
Korosu’s savior struggles to keep the evil one at bay.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“What’s wrong Frieza? You seem to be
struggling” The unknown force laughed with a hint of straining in his voice.
Seeing his opportunity as Frieza is distracted, Korosu hastily raises his hands
in front of his eyes, and shouts the word “Solar Flare!” A blinding flash of
brilliant white light is emitted which temporarily blinds everyone in the
vicinity with the exception of Korosu. Frieza drops him to try and push the pain
away from his eyes as they burn and sting agonizingly. Before sprinting off into
the distance, Korosu grabs his savior in a noble way, and quickly runs off with
him in toe, despite avid protests from the hero.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Frieza roars with antagonism as he slowly begins
to have his vision restored albeit a little blurry, after the excruciating
damage suffered from the aggravating attack by that pesky ‘monkey’. Korosu
rapidly evacuates the area hoping not to meet up with any more hostile
situations for a short while. He hastily dashes over a small hill, then drops
the guy who rescued him on the floor. Before he manages to get a glimpse at his
redeemer he collapses on the floor with a loud thud, causing dust to fly up, and
excess blood to fly off his face and body and scatter across the surroundings.
Unable to lift one of his increasingly heavy eyelids, the Saiyan just decides to
fade into unconsciousness, leaving his liberator to fend for himself, and
hopefully save them both.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Damn idiot” Korosu’s rescuer mutters to
himself as he looks down at the person he assumed to have become another
casualty of war. “Why’d he have to go and fight Frieza? Is he completely
stupid? Now that moron’s got me caught up in this! Damnit! I may be a match
for Frieza now, but he said he had more than one form…I can’t run, it would
be a waste of time. I have to meet my problems face on!” With that the man
dives from out behind the safety of the hill, and straight into the path of
Frieza. He takes a deep breath, clears his throat, then swings his fist right
for his enemies face. Frieza hears the disturbances in the air currents coming
towards him, and turns to stare emphatically at the oncoming assault.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yes, I thought it was you” Frieza smirks
before barely managing to dodge the powerful punch. “I always knew you’d
betray me one day, but didn’t expect it to be so soon.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“You killed my father and my people! You made
us all work like dogs for you without reward, without any compliments, without
even giving us a break. I shall never forgive you, and you will never redeem
yourself. I hate you!” The figure yelled before sweeping Frieza’s legs skillfully,
then hitting him in the chest with his heel. Frieza gasps for breath, but then
easily avoids a small KI blast sent by his opponent. He then springs off the
floor and buries his fist directly into his Saiyan enemies face, sending him
staggering back. He then goes to finish the fight off by holding out his finger
and pointing it towards the Saiyan.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Bye bye monkey!” Frieza laughs before
unleashing the intense beam, allowing it to rip through the air at an incredible
speed. The Saiyan barely manages to get his arms in front of his face and just
about achieves a semi-block, taking some of the power from the attack, but has
no time to go to further precautions to avoid the onslaught. A huge explosion
eats up the surrounding ground, completely burning the dull grass. As the smoke
slowly clears, there is nothing revealed, not even a dead, smoldering body.
Frieza looks on in disbelief and investigates the area before coming to the
conclusion that the annoying Saiyan was disintegrated by his beam. “Foolish
monkey! No one can compare to the might of the great Frieza!” The victor
laughs manically, knowing that he has won the fight and the war against the
final Saiyans. “That other primate is probably dead too, finally a life
without those stinking Saiyans, what bliss!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Gohan and Goku practice their martial arts,
sparring with each other and not holding back either. They move around rapidly
with almost undetectable speed attacking each other contently. Goku delivers a
particularly powerful blow to his son, and knocks him skimming across the floor
shouting out in pain. The Saiyan then lands on the floor next to him, and lifts
him up kindly before brushing the dust off him. Gohan looks up at his dad with
his face stinging with agonizing pain, but gives off a smile.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“I think that’s enough training for one day
son. Go on in and study for a bit,” Goku said politely. “Then you can go out
and play” he consented. Gohan smiled at the prospect of some free time and ran
off inside, still unable to wipe the huge grin from off his face, the pain
already forgotten. Goku smiles after his son, then continues to train himself,
feeling slightly lonely. He had made a deal with Chi-Chi that Gohan would study
for at least an hour every day if he were to train at all. For this reason he
had to be harsh on Gohan when they sparred to make sure they both got the most
out of it. In wondrous awe, he stares into the sky, wondering what the next day
will bring him. The sun shines dimly as it slowly sets and signifies the fact
that another day will soon be to end, as the adventure will start soon for the
warriors on Earth.</font>

</h3>
		  
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A lonesome ship gently soars across the soft
blanket of the universe, slowly nearing its destination. The depressed pilot of
this medium-sized craft is deep in thought, thinking about how horrific recent
events have been, and coming close to tears at how bad things have become. He
frowns, aggravated screwing up his face and clenching his fists. In a futile
attempt to take his mind off the happenings, the man stares out into the empty
depths of space, where there are billions of light years of nothingness. His
tail swishes angrily, and his face almost beams with frustration as his deep
scar is emphasized in the dim light of the room.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Bardock" a familiar voice said from behind
him. The upset Saiyan knows whom the voice belongs to, but refuses to believe
that it could possibly be the one that he thinks it is, so instead decided to
ignore it, believing it to be a figment of his imagination.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Bardock" it repeats firmly, causing the
Saiyan to turn round out of curiosity. The sight that he sees makes him shed
tears, not out of sadness, but out of joy. Korosu stands limply, covered in
blood, cuts, and bruises, as he sways from side to side attempting to keep his
balance. A goofy grin has spread itself across his face, as he approaches his
good friend.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Korosu!" Bardock yelled happily. "Damn, I
thought you were dead!"</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Yeah, I'd call the fight I had with Frieza a
draw" Korosu joked, laughing intently before having to stop due to coughing up
excess blood. "Frieza…he's too powerful, I don't know if I can ever beat
him, even with your help" Korosu stammered, his voice having a sudden tone of
seriousness to it this time.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"We will do friend, we must train harder than
we ever have before, but it's definitely possible. We are the last two of our
kind; we must fight for all of our dead comrades! We cannot give up; we've
come too far. We'll soon meet up with Goku on Earth…"</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Very nice speech scarface, but I'm afraid
you're mistaken in your calculations. I too am a Saiyan, the prince in
fact." A third voice said, his face partially in darkness. Korosu struggles to
hold Bardock off as the Saiyan desperately tries to get near the prince to rip
him to shreds for the insult.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"There's no way you're prince Vegeta you
liar!" Bardock yelled. "Frieza killed him and his father when he was just a
boy!"</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Wrong again. Frieza did kill my dad, no big
loss, he did kill my people, and I don't really care, but he took me away, and
treated me like a slave! I worked so hard to please him, went through agony and
torment to abide by his wishes, and for what? Not even a lousy compliment, nor
did he ever allow me to do what I wanted! He thought I was his pet, insulting me
constantly, treating me terribly, and still expecting me to do what he
wanted!"</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"I'm sorry to hear that" Korosu said
sympathetically. "Thank you for saving me back there, I would have died if it
wasn't for you"</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Save your petty thanks, I didn't stop Frieza
because of you, it was a personal vendetta. I had a score to settle with him,
but because of you I couldn't finish him off! You idiot, why'd you have to
drag me away?"</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"I…I thought I was helping…" Korosu
started.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"All you did was complicate things! Now because
of you, we're all dead men! Frieza is going to wipe everyone and everything
out!" Vegeta interrupted before walking out of the shadows. On him he is
wearing some dated, dented armour which is chipped, scratched and burnt. It's
a dull white colour and compliments his mood perfectly. Underneath the armour he
wears a deep blue bodysuit, which is equipped with white gloves and boots with a
golden lining on the edge. His face seems to be in a permanent frown, and his
hair is long and stuck up like so many other Saiyan's. Whilst he is a few
inches smaller than Korosu and Bardock in height, he is certainly just as
muscular as them.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"I guess I'm going to have to go with you now
as you've given me no other choice!" Vegeta shouted in an annoyed tone
before walking right up to Korosu's face, and speaking his mind very
aggressively "If Frieza kills me, then you're going down too". He pushes
the damaged Saiyan to the floor, then storms out of the room.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"What an asshole" Bardock grunts after the
prince has ejected himself from the immediate premises. "Even if he did save
your life he still doesn't have any right to talk to us like that!"</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Yeah, he's a complete jerk, but he's also
incredibly powerful" Korosu replied. His body is ragged and beaten, and he is
struggling to maintain consciousness. He wipes some blood from his face, and
then suddenly groans in overwhelming agony. His eyes shut, and he is suddenly
silent. Bardock fears the worse as he doesn't hesitate in taking him to the
medical bay.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It must have been a whole day later when Korosu
opened his eyes again. He was surrounded by a familiar blue liquid, and noticed
that all of his wounds has rapidly deteriorated. He knows that he's in the
regeneration tank and has been nursed back to health by his caring friend
Bardock. Korosu taps on the glass and attracts the attention of Vegeta who just
happens to be passing. The prince looks at the Saiyan in an arrogant way, then
reluctantly releases him from the tank, causing the water to come flowing out
rapidly. Korosu falls out breathing heavily, but is immensely happy
none-the-less. He has somehow survived yet again, and can feel how insanely
strong he has become. His muscles bulge for a while before he finally manages to
relax them.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Put some clothes on!" Vegeta shouted at
Korosu who was grinning like an idiot at his newfound strength, not realizing
that he was totally naked. He briskly runs off to his quarters, and hastily gets
dressed into his regular fighting clothes, before searching for Vegeta once more
with only one question on his mind. He finds him in barely any time at all, just
outside the worn down training room which has already had way too much activity
going on inside it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Hey Vegeta, can I ask you something?" the
young Saiyan questioned politely.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"As long as you make it quick, I have more
important things to do than waste my time with the likes of you" was the
subtle reply from the prince.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"How did we get onto this ship? I remember
Frieza shooting some sort of blast at me, and I felt its heat on my face, but
suddenly I ended up behind Bardock, unscathed from the attack. You were right
next to me too."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Some weird alien creature used a strange
technique to teleport us away" Vegeta replied unenthusiastically.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Wow! I didn't even know that it was possible
to do that!" Korosu exclaimed excitedly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Well now you do kid. Anyway, he
instantaneously went back to his planet after taking us here, didn't even say
a word."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"How odd. I guess we're eternally grateful to
him though, whoever he was" Korosu thought out loud.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Maybe you are, but he pulled me away just as I
was about to kill Frieza the idiot!" Vegeta said aggressively before walking
off into the training room, a towel draped over his shoulder, and weights in his
hands.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">'Man, that guys so self-centered and full of
himself!' Korosu thought to himself. Before he has anymore time to think
though, his string of thought is interrupted by the familiar beeping, signaling
an imminent announcement from the computer.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"10 minutes until arrival on Earth" it
broadcasted. Korosu excitedly hurried down to the ships bridge to prepare
himself for the landing, excited at finally making it to their destination. He
buckles up and watches as Bardock frantically keys in the controls as the ship
speeds down to the blue and green planet, before rushing to his seat and
strapping himself in.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The ship cruises into the atmosphere, constantly
picking up speed as it becomes a fiery ball of flame. Bardock and Korosu close
their eyes as the ship nears the surface. Suddenly the speed decreases
massively, and the ship comes to an abrupt halt, landing almost perfectly. The
two Saiyans walk out of the automatic doors to begin their quest to search for
Goku. Little did they know they were being watched by many people who had sensed
their powers coming, as they hid around the crater ready to pounce.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Vegeta comes out soon after, holding his ribs and
moaning about the way in which the amateurs landed the ship. It is he who
realizes that something is wrong, something around them is not right.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Korosu slowly walks across the rough ground, and
pulls himself out of the crater, closely followed by his two acquaintances
Bardock and Vegeta. The apparent leader of this small gang looks around
enthusiastically, and then presses a few buttons on his scouter, looking around
for life. It takes a while, but eventually it blinks a few times, signifying
some weak presences around them, nothing to be concerned about. Upon closer
examination though, Korosu realizes that not only are they around them, but
they're only a few meters from them. He desperately looks into the shrubbery
and long green grass, frantically searching for the inhabitants of the planet
who are seemingly hiding from them.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Vegeta notices that Korosu seems to be panicking
slightly and looking around like an idiot, so he glances at the immediate
surrounding area, thoroughly unimpressed by the planets appearance. Bardock
joins in the hunt too, but like Vegeta he doesn't really know what he is
searching for, but continues to look all the same.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Korosu hears some movement from inside a nearby
bush, and casually strolls over to it before dunking his hand in and pulling out
whoever is inside. The resident of the overgrown shrub is only harmless
squirrel. He laughs with the small mammal squirming in his hand, and is soon
joined by Bardock who realizes what they became so jumpy about. Vegeta however
merely grunts at their idiocy and begins to explore the planets surface himself.
He uncovers no more than the others though, and turns to them with a rather
annoyed expression on his face.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"There's nothing here you morons!" he
shouts rudely. Bardock and Korosu merely glare at him for being so obnoxious,
and let their guard down. "Now are we going to find this Goku person or
not?"</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Sure…this place though…Earth…it seems
familiar…" Bardock responded before he and Korosu followed Vegeta into the
unknown depths of the desert of this seemingly deserted planet.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Wait" a voice said from behind Korosu. He
turns to Bardock to see if it was he, but the Saiyan simply shrugs his
shoulders, confusing the small group of aliens. "Over here" the voice said,
making Korosu glance sideways to see a tall figure in a red GI, his facial
expression incredibly serious. He has leaves and small twigs sticking to him
showing that he's been hiding in a tree or in a bush awaiting their arrival,
and worried about whether they were hostile or not. The strangest thing is that
his facial details are almost exactly identical to that of Bardock's, only
this character seems a big younger, and lacks the scar on his face. "State
your business here" the person droned in a completely serious, and somehow
intimidating voice. Korosu takes a scouter reading on his power level and sees
that it is a mediocre six thousand.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"No wonder they were hiding, they have puny
power levels compared to us" Korosu states. "We come seeking a man named
Goku" Korosu said, but it seems that no one is paying any attention any more.
Bardock and the newly revealed man are staring deeply into one another's eyes,
and Vegeta is comparing them in a puzzled way.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Kakarotto?" Bardock asks. "That's why
this planet is familiar, Kakarotto, you were sent here as a child!"</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"I am Goku, not Kakarotto"</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Hey Goku, that guy looks just like you" a
fairly high-pitched voice came from down by the mans feet. "In fact…if I
didn't know better I'd think he is you!" he remarked, before revealing
himself fully, showing his small torso, and bald head.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"What do you want from me?" Goku asked,
ignoring the midget.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"We were asked to find you, and we have traveled
all the way across the universe just to meet you. We were supposed to learn more
techniques, and ask you to help us defeat Frieza, but it seems that you're not
powerful enough to be of any real use to us." Korosu scoffed, seemingly
careless of Goku's feelings.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Actually I'm compressing my true power,"
the Earthling countered. "We can all do it. I am much more powerful than you
think, in fact I'm slightly stronger than you are at the moment."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Prove it then Kakarotto" Bardock asked
confidently.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Alright, watch those reading things shoot up
as I charge up" Goku smirked, before focusing all of his KI energy, and
forming a blue aura around himself that keeps rising higher and higher.
Eventually Goku notices the sheer looks of shock on everyone's faces, and
terminates the aura, completely canceling it out and making it disappear. He
keeps his power level relatively high just to satisfy the new visitors as he
gives a cocky grin.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"I stand corrected" Korosu gasps, overwhelmed
by Goku's power. "Please, I would be honored if you could train me and my
companions."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"I dunno, I'm not really much of a trainer
myself but I know a few good ones who might help you improve your strength. I
suppose I could teach you all a few of my basic techniques though."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Thank you Kakarotto" Bardock said kindly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Alright, this is getting annoying. Why do you
keep calling me Kakarotto? I'm Goku!"</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Well…actually Goku…" the midget started
to say guiltily.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"What is it Krillen?" Goku asked, revealing
the bald head mans name.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Master Roshi told me that when you were
younger you were found by your adopted father Gohan."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"I already knew that though..."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Yeah, but what you probably can't remember
is that you were found near a space pod, and you used to be a vicious little
guy, totally uncontrollable, right up until you hit your head really hard,"
Krillen explained.</font></p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></span><font size="2" face="Arial">"Kakarotto…I
mean Goku, you are a Saiyan. As a child you were dispatched to conquer this
planet, but when you hit your head you must have forgotten your mission."
Bardock elucidated. "You are my son Goku."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"What?" Goku asked rhetorically.
"How…why…but…" he stammered, unable to properly get the words out.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Listen, is there anywhere we can go to talk,
I'd like to catch up on all that I've missed of your life" Bardock asked
considerately.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Yeah, but first I need to know about this
Frieza guy. You said you needed help to beat him, but you lot are all incredibly
strong already, especially that guy over there" Goku said pointing to Vegeta.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"You want to know about Frieza eh?" Vegeta
said, breaking his callous silence. "He is the most merciless being alive, he
won't hesitate to destroy entire civilizations and races. He has power beyond
the pinnacle of your imagination! Frieza will destroy this whole entire planet
soon, he's already following us from what I can predict" the Saiyan prince
sneered, making everyone look at him in horror, including Korosu and Bardock who
has previously assumed that they'd escaped Frieza's grasp for now. "Oh
yes, I'd give him a week or so before he works out where we are."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Damn! How strong are we talking about?
Couldn't we all take him out with our combined power? There's quite a few
beings round here who have power levels that are approximately near mine."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Don't be so naïve Kakarotto!" Vegeta
shouted in a patronizing way. "He is stronger than me in his first form alone!
I don't know how many of these forms he has, but I know his power increases
every time he transforms! We'd be slaughtered!"</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Ok, I understand. Krillen, take these two to
Kami and ask him to train them" Goku said motioning towards Korosu and Vegeta.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Kami? Are you sure Goku? I mean we don't
even know if we can trust them yet, let alone allow them to see Kami!" Krillen
stammered.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Don't worry, if what they say is true then
we'll need their help. I can sense that they have no reason to attack us, and
their hearts seem to be swaying towards good."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"I'm going to talk to this guy who claims to
be my Dad…erm…we haven't all been introduced yet have we? This guy here is
Krillen" Goku stated pointing towards his good friend the midget. "So who
are all you?"</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"I'm Korosu, this is Bardock, and…"</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"And I'm prince Vegeta, a true Saiyan, unlike
you I see."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Vegeta! Let's not get into an argument now,
we need to train as hard as we can before Frieza arrives" Korosu pleaded.
"If we don't all get on well, then we're doomed as there wont be any team
work between us will there?!"</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Think about it Korosu, where's Kakarotto's
tail? If he was any sort of a Saiyan then he'd bare the sign of one!"</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"I…I had my tail cut off when I was young. It
caused too many problems apparently." Goku said guiltily. "Am I a Saiyan
then? An alien from outer space?"</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Yes, you're from the planet Vegeta, you're
one of the four remaining true people of ours. Frieza blew up our planet and
killed all of its inhabitants, but we were lucky enough to escape" Korosu
explained.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"You fool! You've lost your ability to
transform under a full moon!" Vegeta blurted out, still obviously bothered by
Goku's lack of a tail.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"What?" Goku asked, still confused about the
whole concept of these new things being introduced to him.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"When a Saiyan looks up at a full moon he
transforms into a giant, mighty ape, and you've been stupid enough to prevent
that from happening!" Vegeta mocked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Look, Goku's probably got lots of questions,
and I have lots for him, so I'm going to go talk to him, Vegeta you and Korosu
should go with his friend to this Kami character" Bardock said, trying to
become the leading authority.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"Just what I was thinking" Korosu agreed.
"Come on Vegeta, let's go" Vegeta reluctantly immersed himself in his own
blindingly white KI, shortly followed by Krillen and Korosu doing the same
thing, as the three of them take off heading towards Kami, led by the small guy.</font></p>

and Goku then begin discussing just about every issue there is to possibly talk
about, and walk off in the general direction of Goku's home, starting to get
acquainted to each other. It's not every day that your dad arrives on your
planet and explains that an evil villain is going to soon come and kill everyone

most of it, they may not be with each other much longer.</span></font></sub>

</h3>
		  
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A reunion between a father and son who haven’t
seen each other for about 20 years doesn’t often happen, but when it does
there are two paths that it can take. It can either be a huge success, with both
instantly growing attached to each other, or a huge failure, where both man
hates the other intensively. Luckily though, the reunion between Bardock and
Goku has so far been going extremely well.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The two sit at a large table in the quaint
kitchen of the Son house, with Chi-Chi hastily preparing an epic meal,
scampering around rapidly in her cooking apron, and sorting out every aspect of
it, attempting to make it perfect for their guest. Gohan sets the table
politely, walking across the cold stone floor, and placing every knife and fork
delicately down, producing four places, all evenly spaced out.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Gohan, please can you go and get your father
and his new friend?” Chi-Chi asked assertively. The young half-Saiyan boy
doesn’t say a word, but merely rises to his feet obediently, and walks off to
find the two adults, obliging in his mothers wishes. “It’s not like Goku to
be away during a meal, he must be having a really good time” Chi-Chi thought
out loud, smiling weakly at the prospect, and attempting to ward off any doubts
about his safety, albeit completely unsuccessfully.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Gohan silently strides outside the house, then
carefully senses for power levels in the surrounding area. It doesn’t even
take a second to work out where the two are, as the boy’s senses work with
incredible precision. He powers up slightly, becoming immersed by brilliant
white KI, then flies off towards their location, moving at an almost
undetectable speed. He flies over a fairly large forest that thrives with
prosperous trees, and countless animals, playing around in the bushes or on the
ground, pretty much going about their simple daily business. Gohan sighs
dejectedly, life is so simple for all the wildlife, they don’t have a single
worry in the world and most of them live to a great age. On the other hand he
must face the most powerful warrior in the universe in just a few days, with
his, and everyone else’s life at stake. It isn’t fair, why can’t he just
swap places with them for a week or so, at least if Frieza destroys the Earth
and its inhabitants the chances are it’ll be painless and unforeseen for them.
For him though it’ll be a long, agonizing death, full of suffering and
torment.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He is shaken out of his depressing thoughts when
he senses his dads power level again, with it being right below him this time,
in a small clearing surrounded by trees, a perfect hide out from the troubles in
the world. Gohan diminishes the KI around him, then slowly floats down to the
ground, landing just on the border of the clearing. He looks around for his
father, but cannot see him, although is KI signature is definitely in the
immediate area. A rapid gust of wind makes Gohan go staggering backwards, which
is in turn followed by a few more bursts until it stops as unexpectedly as it
started, and all is silent. The kid suddenly realizes what is going wrong, and
cautiously glances around. Without warning he shoots out a small KI blast, which
goes through the air at an impeccably fast speed. A tall, dark haired man then
appears in front of it, almost completely taken by surprise as is revealed by
his fearful eyes, before he leans backwards, barely avoiding the blast.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Hey Dad!” Gohan exclaimed excitedly. “I
almost got you that time!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Heh, well done son,” The man replied,
revealed to be none other than Goku. Another figure then appears, as if from out
of nowhere. This figure is definitely a man, proven by his muscular physique,
and boyish looks. He has a deep scar running across his cheek, and a sly grin
across his face. It is now apparent that the reason Gohan couldn’t see his dad
and granddad was because they were moving at such rapid speeds that their
movements were completely undetectable.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Hey kid” the man said casually.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Hi Bardock” Gohan replied. “Mom said its
time to eat tea, and asked me to get you.” Goku nodded, and everyone flew off
towards the small cottage where Chi-Chi was growing impatient, stomping across
the floor, and shouting, completely enraged.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“What’s taking them so long?” She asked
herself rhetorically. “I spend all day cooking this meal, and is it
appreciated? Of course not! Goku’s got better things to do than come and eat
with his wife, such as talking to that new friend of his…it’s just not
fair!” Chi-Chi stated, a hint of annoyance and sadness in her voice. Before
she can continue her ranting though, the two Saiyans and the kid burst through
the door, and all sit at the table expectantly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Hi dear!” Goku grinned.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Don’t you ‘Hi Dear’ me Mr! Where’ve
you been? I’ve been worried sick about you!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Relax, we’ve only been down in the clearing
for a while.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“A while? A while?! You’ve been there for
almost two days!” Chi-Chi yelled out ferociously. “I thought that you had
been killed, or injured! Didn’t it even occur to you that maybe you could tell
me where you’re going next time?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Sorry…” Goku said flatly and guiltily,
exactly like a small child who has just been caught stealing from the cookie
jar.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Let’s just eat” Chi-Chi said, unable to
stay mad at her husband who she has come to love so much over the years, as she
dishes out the food. Of course it is eaten rapidly in a matter of seconds, as
Bardock turns out to have just as big an appetite as Goku.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Hey Chi-Chi” Goku said between mouthfuls,
half his food being spat everywhere “Do you mind if we take Gohan up to
Kami’s to train?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“WHAT?!” Chi-Chi yelled aggressively, making
everyone cower in their seats. “TAKE MY SON TO TRAIN? HE COULD BE HURT!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“C…calm down…” Goku started, but is cut
off straight away.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Gohan has to study” was the stubborn reply
as Chi-Chi begins to gather her bearings again.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“But…” Goku tried to say before being
interrupted again.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“You’re rotting his mind with all this
fighting you know. What about his future? How is he ever going to become a
famous scholar if he doesn’t spend his time studying?” She asked
rhetorically.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“But if he doesn’t train then Frieza will
probably destroy us all!” Goku argued. Bardock may not have known either of
them long, but it was fairly obvious who was going to win this little
discussion, and that was of course, Chi-Chi. Gohan groaned, as he knew this too.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“No, and that’s that!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“But mom!” Gohan moaned. “What if Frieza
destroys the whole Earth! Then I won’t be able to become a scholar!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Listen young man, if you don’t stop
disagreeing with me, you’ll go straight to bed! Understand?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yes mother”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Good! Now eat your tea” The rest of the meal
was eaten in complete silence, no one daring to say a word. Naturally, with the
speed that Goku and Bardock ate at, it took a mere matter of seconds for
everything to be disposed of, so it really didn’t make that much of a
difference. They waited patiently for Gohan and Chi-Chi to finish, as it is
considered rude to leave the table when others haven’t finished.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Erm…Gohan, I was thinking…you know if we
saved the world and you helped, there’d obviously be a lot of money
involved” Bardock said, clearly aiming his words at Chi-Chi. “And you know
what you could buy with a lot of money?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“A really good education?” Gohan answered,
working out where the conversation was heading. Chi-Chi is intrigued by this,
and raises an eyebrow. After a great deal of thinking, she gave him permission
to train, although it seemed to cause her pain.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A short while later, Goku and Bardock were
walking out of the front door with some suitcases, closely followed by Gohan.
Chi-Chi walks towards them accusingly, about to demand an explanation for them
taking all of that stuff.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Bye Chi-Chi, we’re going to Kami’s for a
few weeks, love you!” Goku said, disappearing out of the door along with the
other two, not even giving his wife time to argue with him, or even disapprove
of where they are going.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“They’ve gone again, leaving me all alone”
Chi-Chi said, expressing her annoyance, and dejectedly wandering into the house,
walking backwards and staring at the trails left by everyone flying. “Good
luck Goku, please come back alive” she expressed to herself, a tear forming in
the corner of her eye.</font></p>
<p align="center" style="text-align:center"><font size="2" face="Arial">******</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Kami’s Lookout, the place that everyone would
want to be. You can see literally the whole world from the extravagant palace,
and everything seems absolutely perfect. The architecture is designed
exquisitely, and faultlessly. There are no annoying drunks or imperfections in
people up here…in fact there’s only two humanoids, one is a Namek, and one
is an unidentified creature. The Namek is old and somewhat frail, carrying a
wooden staff, the God of Earth, someone extremely important and necessary to the
survival of the planet. The unidentified thing is a short, plump, almost
completely black thing with large lips, and a turban atop of his head. Despite
his odd appearance, he is still an immensely likeable character. He is the
gardener, or maintainer so to speak, and without him the place wouldn’t look
anywhere near as good.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">At the moment the lookout is occupied by a few
people, busily scuttling around at speeds that are practically unnoticeable to
the untrained eye. The occasional flash of light can be seen, and it goes this
way for almost 30 seconds until the movement comes to a halt, and two figures
are revealed, breathing very heavily, and one looking distinctively more worn
down than the other. Upon closer inspection, one would be able to come to the
conclusion that the two fighters are prince Vegeta, and Korosu. They have been
doing a form of sparring, albeit it far more intensive, with excessive physical
injury being distributed to both, but especially Korosu as he has the inferior
power level.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Saiyan is a bleeding wreck; his face a
mixture of cuts, bruises, and mangled facial features such as a broken nose, and
fat lip. One of his eyes is being forced shut due to overwhelming pain in it,
and his arm is limply hanging at the side. His fighting gear has been damaged
terribly badly, with a huge fist shaped hole in his armour, and numerous rips in
his trousers. He sways limply from side to side, before falling onto one knee,
and groaning in agony. His whole appearance has been distorted past any recognizable
state, and had Krillen not arrived with a fresh batch of sensu beans, his life
could have been wasted carelessly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Vegeta smirks arrogantly, practically in prestige
condition, except for one small cut that runs across his cheek, emitting a
quaint quantity of blood, but not enough to bother the prince. He looks down at
his now fully revived training partner, and walks off in disgust, having not
even been given a challenge by him. When Vegeta is out of sight, Korosu gets up,
helped by Krillen, and it in total disbelief at the princes power. He gives an
aggravated shout, seeing how Vegeta is far beyond a level that he will reach any
time soon. Krillen attempts to comfort him, but Korosu pushes away the human in
a fit of rage.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Use your anger to enhance your training” A
voice suggested, coming from Korosu’s left. The Saiyan turns round to see Kami
standing over him ominously. Korosu doesn’t dare disrespect a God, so he
stares right at the Namek for a while, waiting for a follow up to the
suggestion. Eventually he gets one after a considerably long amount of
consideration. “I want you to work as hard as you possibly can on exercises
such as press ups, push ups, squats, and practicing your close-combat fighting
moves. Find out your maximum, then proceed to do this as a daily exercise. Come
back after you’ve calmed down, and I will teach both you and Vegeta some new
techniques and training methods.” Korosu obediently walks off, and begins
training, isolated from the rest of the lookout in a small corner, and working
to an extent that not even he thought possible. Krillen sighs then goes to train
himself elsewhere. Before he can walk off though, Kami takes hold of his
shoulder, and prevents him from moving any further. “Krillen, you must use the
room of spirit and time to increase your power level. There are a few things I
need to teach Vegeta and Korosu before they enter it though. Two people can go
in at once, so I want you to take someone in, and train with them.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Room of Spirit and Time? What’s that?”
Krillen responded curiously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“A room where one day out here in the
equivalent to one year in there. It can be used to massively increase your power
level, but you can only go in there for a maximum of two Earth days out here.”
Kami explained. Krillen seems to understand exactly what he’s talking about,
picking up on it very fast. “Now all we have to do is wait for everyone to
arrive.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">About 5 minutes later, Goku, Gohan, and Bardock
all touch down on the lookout. They dump their stuff on the floor, not even
bothering to unpack, and search for Kami in an effort to seek his permission to
train them. Before they find the Namek though, Tien arrives, closely followed by
Piccolo. Realizing that everyone has arrived, Kami reveals himself slyly,
walking out of the shadows, and addressing everyone.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“I’m sure all of you have come here to train
for Frieza’s arrival, but I must state that I will not give any of you
individual attention, you must learn to learn, and function as a group, a team.
Now Krillen, take Tien into the room of spirit and time. I’ll explain what it
is to the rest of you a bit later.” Kami explained, allowing the confused
Tien, and confident Krillen to wander towards the great room. Mr. Popo greets
them outside, and seemingly
</SCRIPT>explains how it works and gives them all the vital knowledge of it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“I will give you all weighted clothes, which
means that you’re GI’s will differ from your normal ones. Bardock, Korosu,
Vegeta, I hope this isn’t too much of a problem, being such a difference to
your usual attire?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Just get on with it Namek!” Vegeta shouted
rudely and impatiently, anxious to get on with the training. Everyone looks at
him as if he has just started to shout during church, and he stands there
completely expressionless, awaiting Kami’s words.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Such rudeness will not be tolerated here,”
Kami said assertively. “If you wish to speak like that, then leave now,
otherwise I will begin the training.” Vegeta seriously considered the prospect
of leaving, but decided against it, curious to see what this room of spirit and
time actually does. The Namek begins giving everyone their daily routines, with
slight differences on each one according to power. Everyone starts to train as a
group, all of them working hard as possible. The real training is soon to begin,
and with Frieza looming ever nearer time is of the essence. Will all this be
enough though?</sub>
<hr><a name="P21"><h3><font color="#2F69A8" face="Arial">Chapter 21 - Training</font></h3>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Korosu hovers calmly on the ground in a sitting
position, his brow creased up in concentration. Heavy winds blow around him,
swirling at higher intensities as he falls deeper into his meditation. Beads of
sweat have slowly begun to drift down his face, and within minutes there is a
small puddle of it underneath him. The intensive winds get to their peak, and
begin to create a swirling vortex. Many things are sucked into it from atop the
beautiful lookout, and it quickly attracts everyone’s attention. They
immediately stop their training and gaze in awe at the aura that has seemingly
spontaneously been created as a miracle of nature. Being at such high power
levels as they are, it requires little effort to plant themselves firmly on the
ground, but even so it is an incredible sight to behold.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Only Vegeta has noticed the power of the aura,
able to sense Korosu’s familiar signature on it, and managing to figure out
just how strong it is. It is then that it occurs to him that all this is being
controlled by the Saiyan’s mind. The prince cannot believe that such a weak
individual can create such an amazing force by use of telekinesis. Rapidly the
swirling wind gains power until it slowly pulls the rooftops off the small rooms
dotted across the palace-like grounds. Before it can completely destroy the
surroundings though, the havoc-wreaking gale finally comes to a halt, and
gradually disappears, losing all of its power.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Everyone hastily searches for the source of the
wind, believing that there is no way that there can be a natural hurricane of a
wind like that. Vegeta sees them all scampering around and looking for problems
in the air currents and lookout, and grunts in disgust. He then does the
sensible thing and locates Korosu’s KI. Within moments he has found it, albeit
an extremely weak version, making him march over with a degree of concern. What
the Saiyan prince finds is a sight he certainly could not have predicted in even
his wildest of dreams – Korosu lies on the floor, completely motionless, his
torso a bloody wreck, and his face almost sucked of all its life. In a frantic
panic, Vegeta grabs the injured Saiyan by the scruff of his neck, and hurriedly
pulls him to the centre square of the lookout. This consists of a comparatively
large clearing, isolated from the remainder of the lookout, which is scattered
with exquisite architecture. It is often used as a place to train, or the host
of a meeting or announcement.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Vegeta drops Korosu onto the floor, and everyone
is immediately surrounding the two, desperately trying to figure out what has
happened. Gohan is frozen with horror, thinking that this nice man is going to
die, as his power keeps on facing a demeaning descent. Vegeta looks down
thoughtfully, almost showing signs of sympathy on his cold, hard face. It
doesn’t take long for Kami to pick up on the goings on, and quickly hatch a
plan.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Goku, go and get a sensu bean off Karin, tell
him that I need it” the old Namek quickly said. “The rest of you, get back
to training, there’s nothing any of you can do to help him now. Bardock, Goku,
I want to see the two of you sparring in the training room. Piccolo, Gohan, you
two can practice your moves…but I suggest that you do it back on Earth because
the conditions are better.” Piccolo nods his approval, and prepares to take
off with his newly acquired training partner, and best friend. Before they go
though, Kami puts his hand on the Namek’s shoulder. “Return tomorrow, and
you two shall use the room of spirit and time. Good luck.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Piccolo and Gohan nod once more, almost
robotically, then speedily wrap themselves in their own blindingly bright KI,
before diving off the edge of the lookout, and flying off to train elsewhere.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Kami!” a voice shouts loudly from behind
God, making him jerk round hastily. “Catch!” the voice hollered, completely
taking the Namek by surprising. Somehow Kami managed to get his hand up to make
the catch, albeit barely. He looks at his hand, and sees a sensu bean inside it,
looks at is hesitantly, then scurries over to Korosu. “Thank you Goku” he
calls out on his way to the battered Saiyan.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Vegeta looks on as Korosu is fed the magic bean,
and slowly regains his energy. He sits up in disbelief, not really knowing what
has happened. When he sees Kami, Vegeta, and the welcoming face of Goku, he
realizes that his meditation went dreadfully wrong. The Saiyan forces a smile,
then squints in pain as he holds his head. The action of the bean slowly takes
affect as Korosu’s pain gradually deteriorates. He manages to struggle up to
his feet, then gazes around at everyone surrounding him, all looking on
expectantly, as if waiting for an explanation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“I…I was meditating…I pushed myself too
hard I guess…” Korosu stammered, slightly shocked by the impact of him
passing out.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Damn right you were you idiot! You almost
killed yourself!” Vegeta shouted, almost in a caring way. “It was you who
caused that wind wasn’t it!” the Saiyan demanded to know.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yeah”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Care to elaborate on how?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“I just pictured this wind in my mind, and
concentrated really hard. Kami taught it to me while you were practicing your
attacks. It can be really useful if you’re trying to learn a new technique, or
want to test your power.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Why did you hold on for so long?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“I didn’t want to give in to the pain, I
really thought I could beat it!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“You idiot!” Vegeta yelled, enraged at his
teammate almost killing himself. “If you die then we’ve got less of a chance
against Frieza! I may need you to be a decoy, or distraction or something!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“And for a second I thought you were being
compassionate” Korosu joked. Vegeta merely grunted at him arrogantly, then
walked off. “Sorry Kami” the Saiyan said dejectedly, looking up at his
trainer but avoiding eye contact.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Korosu, I want you to do 10,000 press-ups”
Kami said, almost ignoring Korosu’s previous actions. “After you’ve done
that you can do 10,000 sit ups without any rest. After that I’d like to see
10,00 squats and then stretch if off. Oh yeah, and you seem to have torn those
weighted clothes I gave you, well here’s some new ones”. The Namek held out
his hand, and yelled, emitting a beam right at Korosu. The Saiyan’s old
clothes were replaced by brand new ones, which take him down to one knee.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Ka…Kami! These are heavier than before!”
Korosu whinged.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“They’ll make you stronger then” The Namek
casually replied, walking off and leaving Korosu to do the exercises set to him.
Not wanting to disobey God, the Saiyan does what was asked of him, although had
a lot of trouble even doing one press up, due to the hugely increased weight
which he was now carrying.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">‘I can sense a great potential in that one’
Kami thought to himself, referring to Korosu. ‘I hope those weighted clothes
will help him gain the most from his training.’</font></p>
<p align="center" style="text-align:center"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the training room, Goku and Bardock are moving
at almost undetectable rates, hitting hard and fast. Occasional flashes of light
are scattered across the room along with numerous thuds and clattering sounds,
signalling that the two are fighting. To any untrained eye, and even most
well-trained ones, this would look like some sort of phenomena.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Bardock lunges forward and swings a wild punch
for his sons head, but Goku effortlessly dodges the badly aimed attack, and
moves in closer to Bardock, hitting him with an agonizingly harsh knee in the
stomach. Not giving his dad any time to regain his composure, Goku slams his
clenched fists into Bardock’s back, in an axe handle smash-style attack. The
Saiyan falls to the floor at an unbelievably fast rate, hitting it incredibly
hard, and having his forehead opened up.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Bardock gazes up at Goku, bloody face and all,
and merely smiles. He gets to his feet, and cranks his neck, before stretching
out his legs.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Now it’s time to get serious boy”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Bring it on old man!” Goku mocked, letting
down his guard for a split second. This was more than Bardock needed, and he
quickly capitalized on the opportunity and blasted a beam of KI at the powerful
Saiyan. Goku easily manages to block it, taking most of the impact from it, and
making it cause relatively little damage, but a lot of smoke. This was exactly
what Bardock intending, and he charged into the smoke, rotated his waste
slightly, then delivered a kick to his dear old sons face, with massive
momentum. It was so forceful in fact that it sent Goku through the specially
made reinforced walls, and made him skid across the floor agonizingly. Bardock
doesn’t let his son gather his bearings though, and immediately goes straight
back onto the offensive.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Goku shakes his head and holds his shoulder
painfully, his dad hit him pretty damn hard considering that they were just
sparring. Before he could contemplate his injury any further though, Bardock
delivers a huge punch of epic proportions straight across his face, making Goku
fly backwards, blood spurting forth from his lip, and his eyes almost completely
glazed over. With excessive determination, Goku manages to regain control of his
flight path, and comes to a halt, looking up to see the now familiar sight of
Bardock viciously charging in with the goal of causing some damage.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Goku shakes off as much pain as possible, and
then continues to stand his ground, not even bothering to put up any sort of
defence. His father smiles, thinking that Goku has given up, and showing off his
ignorance. As Bardock swings his fist, aiming for his son’s temples, Goku
seemingly disappears, then reappears behind his dad. He extends him the same
courtesy that Bardock showed him just a few seconds ago, and hits the old Saiyan
hard in the ribs, sending him onto the floor, gasping for air. Goku takes a
quick rest, obviously just as hurt, as these two seemingly equal warriors try to
get a mental advantage. Bardock gets to his feet, and the two go at it again.</font></p>
<p align="center" style="text-align:center"><font size="2" face="Arial">***</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Korosu is grunting with every squat that he does,
hanging his arms limply at his side, and holding his stomach in agony.
Unusually, he has hairs that are out of place, and for a Saiyan this really is a
rarity. Sweat also pours rapidly down his face, and there is literally an inch
worth’s of it collected in a small puddle underneath him. His clothes are as
wet as newly washed clothes, and thus have gained slightly more weight. Every
single muscle in Korosu feels as if it has been pulled, and is aching with
utmost agony. Not even he was used to doing such intensive training, and it is
currently killing him, almost literally.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“9,999…” Korosu struggles to say as he
squats down, his eyes squinted in pain, and his legs vividly shaking. All of his
muscles are definitely bigger than before, and seem to be almost swelling with
every second, bright red, and throbbing intensively. A vein appears on
Korosu’s head as he fights hard to get back into a standing position, with his
back completely straight. The muscle in his leg is completely tense, and is
slowly losing feeling as he bends down, his rectum touching his heels for the
last time as the final squat is achieved. “10,000!” Korosu manages to shout
out loud before falling on the floor, unable to move due to the pure pain that
is immersing him. He breathes heavily, with his chest rising to dizzying
heights, then rapidly falling back down. His muscles begin to contract into
their normal position, and he develops a huge, goofy grin on his face, proud of
himself of finally achieving his task. “Looks like I’ll be camping out here
for tonight” Korosu said thoughtfully, before closing his eyes, and
immediately dropping out due to being so tired.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It must have been another 10 hours before Korosu
woke up, and all of his muscles were still in pain. What he needed now was a
nice long bath, but he didn’t have time to relax, as Frieza would be arriving
very soon. The sleep was too lengthy anyway, and the only reason he was woken
was because of two massive powers. It didn’t even occur to him that he was now
sleeping on a bed rather than on the cold tiles of Kami’s floor. The Saiyan
jumps out of bed, and immediately goes to see whom the power belonged to.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Apparently Korosu wasn’t the only one who was
disturbed by the huge KI levels, as the others had gathered round the place that
he’d just reached. The huge signatures were coming from the entrance to the
room of spirit and time, and were roughly near his. One was slightly lower, and
the other was about the same. Korosu couldn’t believe this, and he knew
everyone’s comparative power levels off by heart, so it couldn’t be anyone
he knew. Maybe they were strangers come to help them fight Frieza? That’s a
doubtful outlook, but an optimistic one. Could it have been one of Frieza’s
henchmen come to soften them up? Surely he couldn’t already have arrived!
Korosu was dragged out of his thoughts as one of them spoke up.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yo guys!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“K…Krillen?” Goku asked curiously,
recognising the voice. Everyone looked at him oddly, not believing that one of
these huge powers could possibly be that midget.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“In the flesh bro!” Krillen replied, smiling
intently. “So what do you think of mine and Tien’s power levels then?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“How…how did you increase by that much in one
day?” Vegeta asked disbelievingly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“The room of spirit and time” was Krillen’s
simple answer. Tien could tell that everyone was looking at them both expecting
more of an explanation, so he elaborated, explaining exactly how the room works,
and its odd time compression system. Everyone was amazed by this, especially
Piccolo who had just silently arrived with Gohan.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“We’re in next” Piccolo grunted, before
casually walking past everyone into the room with Gohan accompanying him.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Do me proud Gohan” Goku exclaimed to his
son, giving him a going away hug. “Good luck Piccolo, I hope you manage to
increase as much as Tien and Krillen have!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“No problem Goku” was the Namek’s simple
reply as he disappears into the misty regions of the room’s entrance.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Frieza is due to arrive soon, and whilst
everyone’s power is rapidly increasing, it may not be enough to beat the evil
fiend. Can Piccolo and Gohan become strong enough to defeat the dastardly
menace? Only time will tell.</font>
<hr><a name="P22"><h3><font color="#2F69A8" face="Arial">Chapter 22 - Gohan
  And Piccolo Emerge</font></h3>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">A new day opens up new possibilities, and new level of power
  to be reached. Unfortunately, with every new day Frieza looms ever closer, hovering
  ominously around the solar system, desperately looking for the &#145;monkeys&#146; that
  evaded him previously. He is currently in an enraged fit, shouting at all who come near,
  and even incinerating a few of his low level soldiers as their incessant stuttering with
  fear gets on his nerves.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">The evil tyrant is currently gazing out of the large
  bubble-like window located at the end of his living quarters. Usually he would have his
  trademark glass of red wine, sipping it exquisitely, but not today however, he is far too
  flustered for trivial matters like that. He has his fists clenched tightly behind his
  back, revealing his huge knuckles. Sparks fly from inside his closed palms, as he cannot
  control himself with his overwhelming anger. He mumbles and grunts a few times, before
  just suddenly roaring out incredibly loud, totally unexpectedly. Frieza completely loses
  it, going absolutely irate, and attacking his many bodyguards to try to nurture some of
  the frustration. He puts his fist directly through a wall, and screams out as loud as he
  can. &quot;Where are those monkeys?!&quot; His soldiers cower in fear, with futile hopes
  that they&#146;ll survive this whole ordeal.</font></small></p>
  <p ALIGN="CENTER"><small><font face="Arial">***</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">Whilst Frieza&#146;s frustration reaches a peak, the warriors
  of Earth are managing to gain absurd new levels of power, surpassing any heard of strength
  plateaus with ease. The Saiyans have been particularly impressive, all of them training at
  a rate that no one deemed possible. Especially Korosu. This young warrior has somehow been
  catching up rapidly with Vegeta, his gravity enhancing clothing has been rendered almost
  worthless as it is no longer a burden to him. He has recently started wearing a bandana
  round his forehead too, which formally belonged to Bardock. He was given it as a kind
  gesture, to thank him for all that he has done. Ever since that, Korosu has been eager to
  surpass everyone by a huge amount, somehow motivated by the red bandana. It is like a
  token to him, helping him to remember his old friend wherever he goes. </font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">Korosu&#146;s training has undoubtedly been the most
  successful excluding those who have been in the room of spirit and time, and the main
  reason for this is sheer determination. No matter how painful or how hard the training is,
  he never gives up. He does his daily warm up allocated to him by Kami which he has already
  adapted to, showing the most potential that the old Namek has ever seen in a warrior.
  Korosu has spent a lot of time doing the warm up lately, in fact this must be the third
  time today that he&#146;s been pushing himself to achieve it. He has already done the sit
  ups and squats, and he is just finishing off with the press ups, going through extreme
  agony and he goes up and down slowly, his arms shaking weakly, barely able to continue
  supporting his weight. A small pool of sweat has formed itself under the Saiyan, and his
  clothes are soaking wet from all the perspiration given off during this exercise.
  &quot;Al&#133;most&#133;.there&#133;&quot; He manages to say, as he goes down for the
  penultimate time. He gives off a roar of effort as he pushes himself up immensely slowly.
  His veins bulge out of his arms, and his muscles are incredibly tense. Korosu breathes
  heavily as he bends his arms at the elbows, and gets his whole body down only an inch or
  so from the floor, causing ripples in the sweat pool as he breathes. Veins in his forehead
  look as though they&#146;re going to explode as they swell greatly, as he closes his eyes,
  and gives one last, massive push, gaining the strength to complete it from seemingly
  nothing. </font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Well done Korosu!&quot; Kami exclaimed, standing over
  the worn out Saiyan commandingly. &quot;Now I want you to practice your melee
  attacks.&quot; Korosu looked up pleadingly with puppy dog eyes, his arms burning and
  stinging as if 1,000 red hot pokers were being shoved ruthlessly through them. He
  helplessly lies in a small stream of his own bodily fluids, unable to draw energy from
  anywhere to get up off his feet. Kami ignores his silent protests though, and continues.
  &quot;First though, Mr. Popo has prepared dinner.&quot; Korosu somehow got an amazing
  burst of energy, as he jumped up onto his feet, and stumbled over to the small building
  where the dining room is located. He is still struggling to breathe properly due to the
  thin air on the lookout, and by the time he reaches the door, he is close to losing
  consciousness, dehydrating, and collapsing. Mr. Popo obviously noticed this, and greeted
  Korosu at the door with a large mug of water, with the Saiyan taking it gratefully, and
  gulping it straight down. He looks on expectantly, as Popo pours him another mug. This
  time Korosu just takes the whole jug off him, and drinks it in seconds, giving off a
  relieved smile.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">10 minutes later of Korosu storms out of the dining room,
  patting his stomach and rubbing is gleefully. Amazingly he is fully recovered, and in his
  usual training frame of mind. This is probably one of the things that contributes to his
  training so much &#150; the fact that all of his energy can be restored so easily and so
  quickly. He hesitates before starting his preset training, as Popo screams a cry of rage,
  knowing that he has to wash up all of the dishes. The other trainees run out past Korosu,
  laughing incessantly as they elude Mr. Popo and his &#145;equal turns at washing the
  dishes&#146; policy. Vegeta however is the only one who doesn&#146;t join in this amusing
  game, as he slowly walks out in his usual grumpy way. He doesn&#146;t say a word, but
  merely goes off to an isolated part of the lookout to continue his solitary training.
  Korosu looks on sympathetically, but doesn&#146;t have time to console the prince as Mr.
  Popo dashes after him with a cleaning cloth in his hand, demanding that Korosu wash up.
  The Saiyan just laughs, and uses his amazing speed and zanzokens to dodge Mr. Popo before
  escaping away from the scene effortlessly. </font></small></p>
  <p ALIGN="CENTER"><small><font face="Arial">***</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">Bardock and Goku grin intently at each other, as Korosu
  practices his moves just behind them. The two charge in at each other at an amazing speed,
  and punch, kick, even headbutt without holding back. Both men are careful not to make any
  mistakes what so ever as they deliver powerful blows at one another. This is the kind of
  father/son relationship that Goku had always dreamed about, which may seem odd to most
  people, but this guy loves fighting and doing it with his Dad would make it even better. </font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">Bardock delivers two swift right hand jabs to Bardock&#146;s
  face, temporarily phasing him, before sending his clenched fist into his dear old
  son&#146;s gut. Goku&#146;s eyes seem to swell, and he gasps for air, desperately trying
  to capture some. Bardock doesn&#146;t let up though, and kicks his son into the air before
  flying in at an amazing pace, attempting to arrive in front of him to intercept him. The
  Saiyan manages to beat his son, but unfortunately for him Goku is no where to be seen.
  Suddenly a figure zanzokens behind Bardock, and delivers a double axe handle smash to his
  back, sending him soaring rapidly to the cold, hard, tiled floor, and causing him to
  destroy much of it with amazing impact. Bardock gets to his feet, and wipes some blood
  away from his face. Goku looks on in a slightly worried manner, but Bardock grins to show
  he&#146;s all right, relieving Goku. Immediately the two go right back at it, clashing
  with each other all over the lookout.</font></small></p>
  <p ALIGN="CENTER"><small><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></small></p>
  <p ALIGN="CENTER"><small><font face="Arial">***</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">Kami gathers everyone together to give Gohan and Piccolo a
  friendly greeting, as the two are due to come out any second. Sure enough the couple
  calmly walk out a moment later, looking distinctively different to before, especially
  Gohan. His hair is much longer, and his face looks more mature. He also wears some new
  clothes, obviously given to him by his trainer &#150; Piccolo. The poor kid has obviously
  had a rough time, his face completely scattered with bruises and cuts. He looks around and
  spots his dad, and a huge grin spreads across his face. Goku responds with a smile of his
  own, and catches the excited boy as he runs in towards him.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;You&#146;ve grown!&quot; Goku exclaimed looking at his
  son. Gohan gave a smile which only a child would be able to maintain, full of joy, as
  fights a losing battle to hold back his tears of joy. &quot;I can sense you&#146;re
  stronger too! Did Piccolo train you well?&quot;</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;It was harsh, and I didn&#146;t think I&#146;d make it
  at first, but Piccolo&#146;s a great guy, and now we&#146;re both powerful enough to take
  Frieza!&quot; Gohan boasted.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Don&#146;t over estimate him Gohan. You&#146;re
  stronger than I am at the moment, and I&#146;m really proud of you, but you mustn&#146;t
  let up on the training. Every little bit helps, ok?&quot; Goku said, changing his voice
  tone to make it very stern.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;You got it Dad!&quot; Gohan said happily. &quot;Am I
  allowed to go and see Mom first though? It&#146;s been a whole year after all&#133;&quot;</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Ok, go on kid, but try not to take too long, we need
  you here to train. There&#146;s bound to be a few things I can teach you before Frieza
  arrives.&quot; Goku responded, before giving Gohan a nod as if to say goodbye, with his
  son doing the same thing. Gohan then dived off the lookout and sped away.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Namek, neither you nor the brat seem that much stronger
  to me!&quot; Vegeta mocked arrogantly.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Well if you must know Vegeta, we&#146;ve been
  compressing our power levels&quot; Piccolo answered defiantly. &quot;Allow me to prove it
  to you!&quot; He clenches his fists, and grunts with effort as a small vein stands out in
  the corner of his forehead. His green arms swell as his muscle mass increases slightly,
  and he is covered in a blindingly white aura which shapes itself around the Namek, a
  little bit like a raindrop. Piccolo gives off a deafening roar before ducking his head
  back, and allowing his last remaining bit of power to show, reaching his maximum, and
  making the aura increase massively in size. He stands tall in a powerful stance, and looks
  on to see the expression on everyone&#146;s face. They are all amazed, even Vegeta who is
  totally speechless for once. Krillen and Tien are in a state of shock, wondering how he
  managed to get so much stronger than them in the same time period. Piccolo smirks and lets
  his aura slowly drain away, going back to compressing his true power.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;But&#133;how&#133;in just one
  year&#133;it&#146;s&#133;impossible&#133;no way&#133;&quot; was all Vegeta managed to say,
  jumbling up his words in a confused frenzy of disbelief. </font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;If you think I&#146;m strong wait until you see
  Gohan!&quot; Piccolo laughed in response. &quot;He doesn&#146;t realize it, but he&#146;s
  just as strong as me now, and when he gets angry he&#146;s unstoppable! I&#146;m not sure
  if even you Saiyans will be able to increase as much as the kid!&quot;</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Thank you Piccolo, I can see that you took time from
  your own training to help Gohan become stronger&quot; Goku said compassionately, seemingly
  the only one to work this out. </font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;We both know that he&#146;s the one with the biggest
  potential, hopefully I&#146;ve made enough of it show for him to beat Frieza&#133;&quot;</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;You mean he can become even more powerful than
  this?!&quot; Vegeta interrupted, refusing to believe what he is hearing. Piccolo looked
  towards the prince and nodded with a cocky smirk on his face. Vegeta goes into a fit or
  rage, not understanding how it could be possible for anything like that to happen.
  &quot;LIAR!&quot; he yelled at Piccolo angrily, before flying off at a great speed,
  heading towards a range of mountains.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;He&#146;ll probably be back a bit later&quot; Korosu
  answered to everyone before they could ask the question. &quot;Now I assume that it&#146;s
  Goku and Bardock next? No point in me going in until Vegeta gets back.&quot; Kami nods,
  and shows the father and son combination to the room. &quot;Good look you two&quot; Korosu
  says meaningfully, his bandana flowing like a kite in the breeze.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Don&#146;t worry Korosu, we don&#146;t need it&quot;
  Bardock replied confidently. &quot;Get ready, because I&#146;m going to become even
  stronger than even you friend!&quot; Korosu smiles at the competitive nature of Bardock,
  and waved a final farewell to both he and Goku. They disappear off to the room, leaving
  Korosu, Tien, and Krillen standing in the center of the lookout. </font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I hope they can increase as much as Piccolo and
  Gohan&quot; Tien hoped.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Hey, this is Goku, if his dad&#146;s anything like him
  then they should be able to get way stronger, but I don&#146;t know if it will be
  enough&#133;&quot; Krillen said sadly.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;It will be.&quot; Korosu responded. &quot;Bardock is an
  awesome fighter, and he will become more powerful than any of us could ever dream of being
  if he works as hard as he possibly can. I know first hand how strong Frieza is, but I
  think we&#146;re in with at least a fighting chance. Frieza&#146;s going down!&quot; Tien
  and Krillen nodded their approval with huge grins of hope on their faces, happily looking
  forward to seeing Goku and Bardock come out. Frieza looms ever closer though, now putting
  immense pressure on his workers to complete the task of locating the Saiyans, with an
  obvious consequence from the violent tyrant &#150; Death.</font></small>
<hr><a name="P23"><h3><font color="#2F69A8" face="Arial">Chapter 23 - Goku And
  Bardock's Power</font></h3>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">The solar system, a collection of planets all held together
  by the pull of each other&#146;s gravity, it contains many planets, and centers around one
  in particular, and that is a blue planet, mainly sea. This planet is famed for its livable
  habitats, and temperate climate. It has given birth to some of the best ever warriors that
  the world will see; yet somehow this planet has eluded Frieza for all this time. Maybe
  it&#146;s due to the rumors of the power that rests there making the tyrant fearful of it,
  or perhaps it&#146;s because of the way it hasn&#146;t really had much of a history in
  intergalactic warfare or trading. It doesn&#146;t really matter though, as Earth has kept
  Korosu, Bardock, and Vegeta safe all this time. Soon it will be time for them to return
  the courtesy by defending it from the imminent invasion from Frieza and his forces. </font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">Goku and Bardock are scheduled to come out of the room of
  spirit and time in just a few hours, an event that is becoming a daily tradition due to
  the excessive use of it lately. Before they get there though, everyone wants to be as
  strong as possible to greet them, so that their power isn&#146;t dwarfed as much as it
  would be. The question will always loom though, can the father and son duo become stronger
  than Piccolo and Gohan did? If they can even match the levels set by these great fighters
  then it would be more than adequate, surely. Soon the answer will come though, as everyone
  is forced to wait patiently, training hard to keep themselves occupied.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">Tien and Krillen have been training together for a long time,
  pitting Earth&#146;s finest humans against one another, with the result usually favoring
  Tien. Their strength increase has been gigantic, although they still aren&#146;t sure
  whether or not it will be enough. They are going into this fight against an enemy
  they&#146;ve never even heard of, apart from when Korosu and Vegeta have spoken of them,
  and that&#146;s been a rare occurrence. Apparently this guy is massively powerful, and it
  will take everything they have to beat him. A year&#146;s worth of training had to be
  enough though hadn&#146;t it? The two still have their doubts, and therefore are forced to
  train as hard as possible, really pushing themselves to the limit.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">Korosu and Vegeta had rarely spoken to each other during
  their time on the lookout, despite the fact that they will soon be spending a whole year
  together in the room of spirit and time. Everytime Korosu has tried to approach the proud
  Saiyan; he has been barked at and made to take his leave. Vegeta won&#146;t be able to
  avoid him forever though, and Korosu knows that they will be able to talk in the near
  future, after all there&#146;s a lot he needs to thank him for, if it wasn&#146;t for the
  prince, then he would be dead. It is incredibly aggravating though, how this arrogant
  Saiyan can be so rude just because he doesn&#146;t match his power. Well he will do soon,
  there&#146;s no doubt about that. He has made a vow to greatly surpass Vegeta, and plans
  to stick very closely to it. This is currently is motivation for training so hard.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">Korosu does his press ups, working as hard as ever, and
  wondering what surprises are in store for him, when Kami silently strolls up behind him.
  At first the Saiyan doesn&#146;t notice the Namek, but after a hesitant pause he realizes
  that there is a figure looming over him. &quot;Kami?&quot; Korosu asks curiously. The
  Namek replies with a mere grunt, but doesn&#146;t interrupt the press-ups that Korosu is
  working so hard on. </font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;See me in the training room as soon as you&#146;ve
  finished these exercises, I need to show you something of great importance&quot; Kami said
  after a brief contemplation. Korosu tries his utmost to nod whilst holding his excessive
  weight up at the same time, but his arms tremble, and all he manages is a sort of head
  bow. </font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">Excited about what Kami wanted, and slightly anxious too,
  Korosu rapidly finishes his daily strength exercises, and runs off to the training room to
  find God, hoping that it is not bad news. His arms are in agony because he finished as
  fast as he could, rather careless really as an injury could easily be attained by using a
  method like that. He arrives at the entrance to the fairly large training room, took a
  deep breath, cranked his neck, and then casually walked inside. He sees Kami in the corner
  pondering over something, seemingly completely out of it. Korosu clears his throat
  intently, managing to attract the Namek&#146;s attention. </font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">Kami strolls towards Korosu, holding something behind his
  back, and a very stern look occupying his otherwise vacant and expressionless face. The
  Saiyan attempts to smile weakly, but fails in doing so, too nervous about what this is all
  about. Kami holds out the item he had behind his back, and Korosu takes it obligingly. He
  looks down in awe at it, and can&#146;t believe his luck. &quot;Is&#133;is this for
  me?&quot; He managed to say, unbelievingly. Kami nodded, and Korosu stared at it for a
  while, overcome with awe. &quot;Can&#133;&quot;</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Yes, I will teach you to use it&quot; Kami responded
  automatically, clearly expecting the question.</font></small></p>
  <p ALIGN="CENTER"><small><font face="Arial">***</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">A roar can be heard from down on Earth as an extremely
  powerful warrior charges up to his full extent, before grunting heavily and muttering
  incessantly. His pupils have disappeared, and his hair is rigid, not willing to give way
  to the wind at all. A dark blue aura surrounds him, almost varnished with a white glow
  around it. His face is scrunched up in effort as he attempts to go onto the next phase of
  his training. The man is wearing a weighted GI which really doesn&#146;t suit him at all,
  but assists in his training greatly. Of course, looks aren&#146;t everything, but strength
  is, a fact well known by this proud man. </font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">The figure breathes heavily as he is at his maximum,
  comparing himself to the other people on the lookout, and realizing that his power his
  unmatched. He gives a smug grin, before a voice comes from the general direction of a
  pillar behind him.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Don&#146;t tell me that&#146;s your maximum
  Vegeta?&quot; It asked mockingly. Vegeta trembles with rage, before the aura somehow
  became even bigger, breaking into the ground below him and forming a small crater.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;What did you say?&quot; Vegeta demanded.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;You heard me. That&#146;s not particularly powerful for
  the so-called prince of Saiyans.&quot; The voice responded.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;More than you Namek! And if you need proof it&#146;s
  all here!&quot; </font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;So you finally recognized my voice&#133;or was it my
  overwhelming KI signature. So am I right to assume that you just challenged me?&quot;</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Yes, unless you&#146;re a coward!&quot; Vegeta shouted,
  before turning round to see Piccolo leaning on a pillar, and grinning contently at the
  easily angered prince. The Namek pushes off, and then begins to power up himself, reaching
  an incredible level of power. Vegeta manages to hide his fear, albeit just barely, as he
  charges in at Piccolo, not allowing him a second to power up. He delivers a clenched right
  fist to the Namek&#146;s cheek, then backs off and grins, waiting for Piccolo to respond.
  The Namek does so, but it is with a laugh.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Don&#146;t tell me that&#146;s all you got
  prince?&quot;</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Shut up!&quot; Vegeta roared before coming at Piccolo
  with a multitude of punches and kicks, moving at an incredible rate of speed, but still
  not fast enough. The Namek dodges everything, then counters with a rigid elbow to
  Vegeta&#146;s cheek. He knocks the Saiyan down on the floor in agony, before walking off
  in disgust.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Ah well, what doesn&#146;t kill you Saiyans only makes
  you stronger, right? Well you&#146;ll need all the strength you can get to increase your
  pitiful power level!&quot; Piccolo grunted, walking to the edge of the lookout and gazing
  down. He is met by Gohan who almost headbutts him in his anticipation to get back up to
  train with them. The two greet one another, but before they could go into any sort of
  formalities, and loud creaking is heard, followed by the unloading of steam, and then
  footsteps. Piccolo and Gohan step back in horror, not able to comprehend the absurd
  powers. &quot;Goku?&quot; Piccolo yelled curiously. The Saiyan walks out towards his long
  time friend, immersed in a white aura, as he gives off amazing power. </font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;D&#133;d&#133;daddy?&quot; Gohan questioned, unable to
  understand how his father could possibly have accomplished such new heights of strength in
  just a year. Goku smiles at his son, and then lets his aura die down. A frustrated shout
  can be heard from over where Vegeta writhes in agony from the blow he took previously. The
  prince gets to his feet, and confronts &#145;Kakarotto&#146; as if he had never seen him
  before. His eyes are wide, and his lip is stuttering as he can&#146;t figure out what to
  say, as yet another person has surpassed his powers. Before he does say anything, another
  huge power ejects the room, only slightly lower than Goku&#146;s. &quot;Bardock?&quot; was
  Gohan&#146;s immediate calculation.</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Hey kid&quot; the figure replied, smiling. He too is
  immersed in an aura, which gives off amazing energy, almost an impossible strength that
  has to be seen to be believed. He is obviously very happy with his training, and impressed
  at how much strength he achieved whilst in there with his son. </font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;No&#133;impossible! How can you be so powerful?&quot;
  Vegeta asked, refusing to understand what he could see. He clicks his scouter again on
  both Goku and Bardock, but the same reading is given. He crushes it in frustration, then
  clenches his fist and pushes right past the two. He yells out with rage, with it paining
  him to see others stronger than him. &quot;I am the one with the royal bloodline, I
  surpassed both of you before, and I&#146;ll do it again! You hear me? I&#146;m going to
  become the strongest fighter in the universe!&quot;</font></small></p>
  <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Vegeta,&quot; came a serious voice from his left.
  &quot;It&#146;s time for us to go train in the room of spirit and time.&quot; Vegeta gives
  off an angry nod, and walks off by himself, entering the room long before the figure
  behind him could, and not even caring to turn round to see who it was. If he would have he
  would have seen it was Korosu, but he would have also seen that he bared a powerful, shiny
  weapon. A sword made from the finest materials given to him by Kami. &quot;Thank you for
  all your training Kami. I will teach Vegeta the KI sensing and compressing techniques you
  taught me. I bid you farewell, and don&#146;t let the others fight Frieza without us. You
  understand? This means a lot to me and Vegeta.&quot; Kami grunts his understanding, before
  Korosu turns and walks into the room, following Vegeta. Their training will be vital to
  the role that they play in fighting Frieza. It is unthinkable that either of these could
  become more powerful than Piccolo, let alone Bardock and Goku, but they will try their
  utmost best to do so anyway. </font></small>

          <p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US">The
          vastness of the room of spirit and time was overwhelming, it was just
          miles upon miles of absolute nothingness. At the moment all that could
          be spotted was never-ending whiteness. It was an intimidating sight to
          behold, as the surroundings were enough to send even the hardest man
          insane.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><o:p>

          only sign of scenery of any sort was in the bulk of the room, directly
          on the center of the massive sphere, if indeed there was such a spot.
          It consisted of a living quarters of sort, with accommodation for two,
          as well as a fridge with seemingly inexhaustible supplies of food. On
          both sides of the building were hourglasses with the grains of sand
          slowly dropping down to the bottom, adding to the cluster that has
          already been collected. A year in this place would undoubtedly be the
          hardest thing that anyone would have to face.<o:p>

          strolled in confidently, a determined look on his completely focused
          face. After his first few steps his fell to the ground, panting
          heavily and straining to stay on all fours. Beads of sweat rapidly
          pour down his face as he grits his teeth and puts all the energy he
          has into standing up. Korosu helplessly gazes around trying to stop
          his legs from shaking so dramatically to little success. This would be
          extremely tough on him, and the strange atmosphere that seemingly
          increases his weight would add to the complications of training.<o:p>

          however, seemed to be adapting fairly well, taking step after step
          forward, each one just as heavy as his last. It looks as though there
          were a bunch of little children holding onto him and weighing him
          down, forcing him to put extra effort into moving. He managed to
          increase the speed of his clumsy walk, before managing to get into an
          odd looking jog with an incredibly uneven stride. It was amazing that
          anyone could manage to get used to the intense conditions so rapidly.<o:p>

          cut off by the arrogant sound of Vegeta’s as he finishes the
          sentence for his training partner.<o:p>

          Korosu could do was stare at Vegeta, his eyes full of a mixture of
          hatred and respect for this cocky, arrogant prince. ‘If he can do
          it…so can I!’ Korosu thought to himself before putting all of his
          effort into breaking into a fast walk, circling the solitary building,
          gaining speed constantly. It was a mere matter of minutes before he
          had forced himself to jog around, mentally putting everything he had
          into it in a test of his sheer determination. The pain was
          frustratingly agonizing as his legs ached and throbbed, and his
          muscles bulged, feeling as though they would explode. He could
          definitely feel his muscles being ripped to shreds, but refused to
          give up as he continued his walk, eventually bursting into a run,
          outpacing even Vegeta. He managed to maintain this speed for a short
          amount of time before falling to his knees in morale killing anguish. <o:p>

          weeks went by inside the room, and Korosu and Vegeta were able to
          slowly begin to get used to the gravity, learning to move freely for
          limited periods of time only, but constantly aware of the power they
          were gaining. Both warriors used their partner as a rival and a
          motivation to work harder and become even more powerful, surpassing
          anything that would be considered possible by mere average men.<o:p>

          conditions were frequently changing inside the overwhelming room, with
          it ranging from blazingly hot to chillingly cold, changing within a
          matter of seconds. Currently it was blisteringly hot with the heat far
          too intense for a normal man, or even someone used to temperatures at
          such levels, but neither Korosu nor Vegeta were phased by it. They
          continued to train hard, working their bodies past any thinkable
          limits. Vegeta would sleep for only a few hours before training once
          more and pushing as hard as he possibly could, nearing death every
          day, defying total loss of consciousness every time. Korosu however
          took a completely different approach, deciding to relax the muscles,
          and to sleep well so his energy would be fully revived for the next
          day. Whilst he didn’t actually get as much training from the days,
          it was far more beneficial. If only Vegeta would have realizes this
          then his strength would have hugely risen.<o:p>

          had been training in the same tedious way for months now, using his
          same old tested regime to improve his power. He would warm up with
          press ups, squats, and sit ups, then go on to more intensive exercises
          such as practicing firing his KI into the distance, and moving as fast
          as he humanly could to test out his moves. By the time he’d finished
          each day, his efficiency would have massively rose, allowing him to
          move speedily without losing much energy. The final thing Korosu would
          train at was his sword attacks, swiping, lunging, and stabbing. It was
          boring, but incredibly effective.<o:p>

          spent together, but merely checked each others power levels
          constantly, comparing it with their own. They had both figured out how
          to hide and sense KI near the start of the training after Korosu
          managed to gain Vegeta’s attention long enough to explain the
          technique to him. The Saiyan was thanked with a punch to the gut, with
          Vegeta walking off, mumbling annoyance at being disturbed. Training
          had been hard, but it would keep on becoming more of a struggle as it

          months had passed now, and Korosu was beginning to realize the secrets
          to training, as he utilized it to the full extent, working as hard as
          he possibly could, pushing far beyond his maximum and sending himself
          into a world of pain. Not even Vegeta was putting as much energy into
          it as his rival, which was unusual, perhaps he was just burning out
          completely now. The Saiyan had put a lot of effort into training, and
          it’s not surprising that he was now completely worn out. His
          strength seemed to have reached a plateau though, as he perfected his
          techniques, but was unable to significantly boost his power. Korosu

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Master
Frieza…” a voice called out urgently, emitting from a small, youthful
soldier who had just foolishly burst into the quarters of the ships owner.
“Sir, we’ve found the planet that those rebels are on!<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">A
figure stepped out of the shadows, a dangerous look on his merciless face as he
bit his lip harshly, his eyes becoming immersed with evil. “Excellent work
soldier…take us down there now…but never walk into my room uninvited again,
or the penalty will be extreme!” said the silhouette in a croaky voice which
would be laughable had anyone overheard it without knowing the sheer might of
this tyrant. The soldier however was well aware of this, and was incredibly
intimidated by the penetrating words, digging into his mind and putting a choke
hold on his throat and mind, making him unable to say anything, or move
anywhere. Eventually he forced himself to stagger out of the quarters, sweating
manically, and panting rapidly, relieved to have survived an encounter with his
maniac of a boss.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">***<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A
feeling of terror loomed over Earth as night time spread a deep black blanket
across its surface, covering Kami’s godly lookout. The Z soldiers could mere
stand there, isolated from every other problem known to man, fully focused on
this one ominous threat – the arrival of Frieza. There was no stopping it.
Goku could distinctly sense that it was approaching, and getting closer and
closer. A huge power roared from out of the sky, before settling down a long way
in the distance. Intrigued, everyone was desperate to go and investigate it, but
were stopped by the current world’s strongest – Goku.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Stay
here until Vegeta and Korosu get out of the chamber, I estimate it’ll only be
about five minutes. We shouldn’t go anywhere without them as they are going to
be vital to our fight, I’m sure of it.” Goku explained like a true leader.
He was very knowledgeable in all aspects of fighting, and was wise to wait, for
otherwise they’d be demolished. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">***<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A
large spaceship floated softly, yet loudly down to the ground, landing calmly on
the grassy floor of a clearing, settling down, and finally going silent. The
engines stopped roaring, coming to an abrupt halt, and the thrusters died down
weakly, before disappearing into the light breeze. The door of the ship was
lowered down, revealing a large opening, and forming a ramp down to the ground. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">A
brief pause ensued the original magnificence of the landing, causing a huge
amount of tension for any spectator that was unfortunate to be nearby.
Eventually a figure stepped out of the shadows gradually, revealing himself to
be the tyrannical fiend known as Frieza. He stepped on the dusty, grassy plain
floor with a look of disgust immersing his face, sniffing the unclean, polluted
air that had wafted over from a nearby city. These humans really were despicable
creatures, it would be a pleasure getting rid of them. But first, there was
business to take care of.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“You!”
Frieza shouted up towards the ship. “Get down here now!” A muscular alien
wearing armour strolled down the ramp confidently, before handing his master a
transparent green scouter, and then put one on himself. It was time to find the
Saiyans that they came for.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">***<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Goku
stood on the edge of Kami’s lookout, clenching his fists and gritting his
teeth wildly. He could sense the sheer intensity of Frieza’s energy, and just
couldn’t wait to get down there to fight him. Being a wise and experienced
warrior, Goku could clearly tell that if he left it any longer then the whole
planet would be destroyed. He was about to charge down to confront the evil
menace, when Mr. Popo ran forward announcing that Korosu and Vegeta were about
to come out.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Everyone
stared towards the room of Spirit and Time’s doors expectantly, awaiting the
arrival of the two powerful Saiyans who had been training inside for a year, the
equivalent to one Earth day. Clouds of smoke poured out, revealing two
silhouettes, obviously very muscular with beautifully toned bodies. As the mist
recoiled, they were revealed, showing off their incredible extravagance. It
wasn’t clear immediately exactly how powerful they were, but if you went by
their appearance, then it wouldn’t be debateable at all that they were perhaps
the strongest on the planet. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Well…”
Goku and Bardock asked, almost simultaneously. Vegeta merely grunted, before
suddenly becoming alert upon sensing Frieza’s mammoth power. He grinned
fiercely, before powering up slightly, and soaring off towards the origin of the
tyrants power. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“It
went well,” Korosu explained, watching the KI trail of Vegeta slowly fade into
nothingness. “We’ve both reached a new level of power, and we’ll be able
to take Frieza out effortlessly.” His sword gleamed brightly, a polished look
to it, standing out despite the velvet darkness. It still looked as good as new,
despite its numerous clashes with undoubtedly rigid surfaces and objects. It
wasn’t worn at all, surprisingly.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Let’s
go then,” Goku said, taking command before immersing himself in a brilliant
white glow, and flying off after Vegeta. He was joined by the others who rapidly
did the same thing, following their self-proclaimed leader. No one argued
though, Goku was definitely the best man for the job. Soon they would encounter
Frieza, and it would be a colossal battle of epic proportions.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">***<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">“It
seems that those pesky Saiyans are coming to us instead…interesting, they must
have been preparing to fight me on this worthless planet. It seems they have
some powerful allies too, but it’s nothing I can’t take care of,” Frieza
thought out loud. Just as he finished his sentence, a shining spec appeared on
the horizon, rapidly approaching. It left a huge trail of beautiful white,
transparent KI in its wake, in a path of destruction as trees, bushes, and even
water was knocked out of the way by the sheer speed and power of the figure. As
it got nearer, Frieza recognised it as being a slightly buffed up Vegeta.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Ah,
hello again Vegeta!” Frieza exclaimed happily. One of his targets was right in
front of him, and practically begging to be destroyed. He was expecting a
fun-filled fight, as last time he checked his counterparts power level, it was
at a mediocre stage, not even comparable to his own&nbsp;.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Shut
up!” Vegeta sneered fiercely. “I came here to fight, not talk, now let’s
go, do your worst Frieza!” He smiled wickedly, an evil smirk covering his
brutal face. He got into a fighting stance, immediately wishing to do battle
with his long-time enemy. Frieza was scowling angrily at being saluted so
rudely, and was irate that this monkey dared to challenge him. He crossed his
arms across his chest, and began to grunt in a droning way, as a flame-like aura
rose slowly around him, before exploding in a fit of rage. It made him gleam and
shine brightly, yet make him seem undeniably intimidating.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“This
will be child’s play!” Vegeta laughed, as he created a roaring fire of
power, submerging himself within it. He didn’t even move an inch as he reached
a mighty height in terms of power, causing Frieza’s scouter to explode in his
face. The tyrant whipped it off and threw it on the floor furiously, before
charging at Vegeta.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Shut
up you stupid monkey!” the tyrant roared, before swinging a penetrating right
fist at his opponents cheek. He struck his target immensely hard too, a sadistic
smirk lighting up his harsh face as he buried his fist into Vegeta’s bloody
head. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Please
don’t tell me that’s the best you’ve got!” Vegeta shouted, much to
Frieza’s surprise, causing the tyrant to have a moment of weak defence as
astonishment immersed him. With one vicious swipe, the Saiyan knocked the evil
tyrant soaring backwards in a mixture of agony and confusion, pain succumbing
him. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">‘How?’
Frieza wondered to himself as he finally managed to regain his flight path and
land on his feet. ‘How can this mere monkey be doing this to me, the mighty
Frieza?’ He stared into Vegeta’s stone cold eyes, seeing nothing but a
merciless killer intent on destroying his target, and unfortunately for Frieza,
that target was him. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Blood
trickled down the Saiyan’s cheek, slowly dripping to the ground and causing a
small puddle of crimson red blood. It gathered together creating a shape rather
like that of a cross, due to the unlevelled terrain. Glimpsing down at it
temporarily, Vegeta noticed the forming ‘x’, before locking eyes with Frieza
in a staredown full of hate and resentment. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“See
this cross on the ground Frieza? It will make the perfect place for a grave for
your beaten bloody carcass once I’m finished with you!” Vegeta yelled
intensely, before clenching his fists. He examined Frieza for a short while
before increasing this size of his already-impressive aura, and smirking in a
content manner. The Saiyan took his left hand on which he wore a spotless white
glove, and wiped it across his cheek, causing the blood to be transferred onto
the formerly beautifully clean material, staining it with a dark redness. Frieza
watched stiffly.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">For
the first time in his life, the evil tyrant was feeling fear, he was shaking
vividly, clearly afraid of what the future may hold for him. For a few moments
he contemplated running, fleeing cowardly from the battle in a vain effort to
escape and gain vengeance on another day. “How?” Frieza demanded to know,
staring sharply at Vegeta. “I am the strongest fighter in the universe, this
shouldn’t be happening to me!”<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Strongest?
Not even close. I’d be surprised if you were even in the top ten now! Me,
Kakarotto, Korosu, Bardock, we’ve all surpassed your pathetic, laughable
strength! I am now the world’s strongest! It is time to die for all that
you’ve done to me Frieza!” Vegeta screamed madly, an enraged madman, focused
on doing but one thing – Kill.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">The
ground crumbled beneath the behemoth of Saiyans feet, the pure power destroying
it, causing a small crater to rapidly form underneath him. Frieza was petrified,
he backed off slightly, sweat continually pouring down his face. He charged at
Frieza, emphatic strength running through his veins, and sadistic hatred pouring
through his blood.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Vegeta,
stop!” a voice called from behind the Saiyan, causing him to grind to a halt
immediately, and jerk round to see where the noise originated from. Standing
behind him was Korosu, Goku, Bardock, Piccolo, Gohan, Tien, and Krillen. Their
eyes were pleading, begging Vegeta to stop his merciless offence on the evil
tyrant. “Leave him!” the voice repeated, with the Saiyan prince managing to
track it down to being that of Goku’s. “Let him live, if you kill him then
you’ll be no better than he is Vegeta!” <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Shut
up Kakarotto!” Vegeta retorted aggressively, his voice conniving and cruel.
“He has done things far worse than anything you could ever imagine! He killed
all of our people! Letting him live would be an injustice, you don’t have to
fight, but I’m going to destroy him!”<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Wait!”
Frieza shouted helplessly, whimpering a little bit. “Surely you want a true
challenge? Allow me to transform into my second form Vegeta, then fight me.
I’ll be far more of a match for you that way. Doesn’t your Saiyan blood urge
you to listen?”<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“My
Saiyan blood urges me to kill you!” Vegeta roared angrily, cutting Frieza off.
“Enough of this foolish banter, this fight ends here and now!”<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Vegeta…”
a voice behind him began. “I say we let him transform, I for one would like to
fight Frieza at his best, and I’m sure you would too.” It was Korosu, his
anxiousness to battle the strongest person in the world was getting the better
of him, his thirst for a challenge overcoming his better judgement. “Please
Vegeta, there’s no honour in killing him when he’s in such a pitiful,
pathetic state anyway” <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Ok…go
ahead Frieza, transform” Vegeta conceded reluctantly. “But I’m the one
who’s fighting him Korosu! If I somehow lose due to his trickery, or, more
likely get bored of his weakness, then you may step in.” Korosu nodded his
head obediently. He desperately wanted to fight Frieza, but he knew how much it
meant to Vegeta to do it, as he’d suffered far worse at the tyrants hands.
“Well? Get on with it, and I’d better not be disappointed Frieza!”<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Thank
you monkeys, you’ve just made the biggest mistake of your life. I’m going to
crush you all, I don’t care about how confident you are! You’re all going
down!” Frieza roared as a mysterious aura exploded in a frenzy of rage around
him. The transformation was beginning, now it would become clear how useful the
spirit and time training was. “Oh and I trust it’ll be one-on-one, I
wouldn’t want you getting lucky and winning merely by outnumbering me…”<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Arial">Vegeta
smirked. “I wouldn’t have it any other way, besides, I don’t need
anyone’s help to kill you!”</font></span>
