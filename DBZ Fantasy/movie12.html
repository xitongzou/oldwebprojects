 <h3><font face="Arial" color="#2F69A8">Dragonball Z Movie 12: The
 Rebirth of Fusion! Goku and Vegeta</font></h3>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The soul-cleansing machine used in the
 afterworld to cleanse bad souls before the trip to Hell has broken,
 due to the incompetence of the demon operating it. Having not changed
 the tank where the souls are deposited, the explosion caused a chain
 reaction, releasing all those in Hell, and sending them back to Earth.
 Even worse, a powerful demon known as Janenba has possessed the
 cleansing machine operator, and has placed a negative force barrier in
 Heaven, diminishing any chance of setting things straight.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">While this is going on, a tournament in
 the afterworld, in which the powerful warriors Son Goku and PaiKooHan
 are fighting is disturbed. The information about the barrier is
 revealed and the two go off to save the day. When they arrive, they
 try to attack the barrier with ki blasts only to find that it absorbs
 the energy of the attacks. Lord En-ma, the chief justice of the
 afterworld informs Goku from beyond the barrier that Janenba has
 escaped, and the demon reveals itself. Goku begins to fight Janenba,
 while PaiKooHan goes off to destroy the barrier.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Back on Earth, Gohan, Videl, Trunks,
 and Goten have their hands full fighting the zombies released from
 Hell, including Freezer, and even Hitler and his army! Goten and
 Trunks decide to have a little fun with ol' Hitler, playing with his
 mind, and going Super Saiya-jin to which he calls them 'punk kids'
 since they 'dyed their hair at such a young age.'</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The fight between Goku and Janenba is
 heating up. They have jumped down into Hell, which has been modified
 to some extent, and has something looking like giant floating
 jellybeans hanging in the air (don't ask...). After learning that
 Janenba can read where his next move will be, and imitate his attacks,
 Goku turns eventually heats up the Super Saiya-jin level 3. He quickly
 lays the smack down on Janny, beating him into a messy goo stain on
 the ground.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It looks like the battle is over, but
 suddenly, Janenba reforms, not into the stay puft marshmallow man of
 before, but as a lean Satan-like form. They fight, and Goku can't keep
 up. Vegeta, released from Hell, comes to his 'rescue' and also gets
 the crap beaten out of him. The two fighters retreat, and after some
 hostility by Vegeta, decide to fuse to make a warrior powerful enough
 to defeat the demon. They perform the Fusion pose (or dance) out of
 sync, and form Fat Gogeta. Not good. He's very weak, his most powerful
 move is being able to fart, and float out of danger, but Janenba can't
 detect his movements.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As soon as they unfuse, they do it
 again, this time right, and are able to defeat Janenba once and for
 all. The barrier has been fully lifted, thanks to PaiKooHan, and his
 effective use of bad language to destroy it (heh). All of the dead
 people go back to their places, and everything is happy and fun again.</font></p>
 <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As always with the Japanese version,
 the voices are perfect. This movie features some of the greatest
 animation produced for a movie of this type, and is accompanied by an
 exceptional soundtrack. It's even got some humor value! If you get the
 chance, buy this movie, as you won't regret it.</font>
