<p><I>Raditz's hair streamed behind him as he hurtled through the air
just above the waves. The brat tucked under one arm had finally learned
to be quiet around his uncle, and the tiny island with its one
dwelling was dead ahead.
</I></p>
<p><I>The long-haired Saiyan tapped his scouter, checking the
readings. Only one power level on the island, in the low three
hundreds--Kakarott. Raditz grinned as the island came into view; he
swooped up, and settled down to land feet-first, facing Kakarott and
the mound of corpses beside him.
</I></p>
<p><I>"So, little brother, you came to your senses," Raditz growled with
satisfaction as he regarded the tangle of sprawled limbs and bloody,
broken bodies. Kakarott looked at him silently, expressionless except
for his hollow, empty eyes. Gohan took one look at his father and
began to scream.
</I></p>
<p><I>Raditz winced at the piercing scream and threw Gohan at Kakarott
as if he were a sack of potatoes. Kakarott didn't move, but let the
child crash into him and fall to the ground, still whimpering.  "The
brat still needs to learn manners, little brother. Now, let's count."
</I></p>
<p><I>Kakarott still said nothing, but silently helped Raditz toss
cold bodies from one pile to another as the bigger Saiyan kept
count. The first body he grabbed was that of a small girl with short
brown hair and brown, shocked eyes; her head flopped loosely on her
broken neck as Raditz tossed the body face down on the grass. The ones
on top were in the best shape; as they got to the bottom of the pile,
the bodies became more disfigured, crushed by the weight of dozens of
corpses on top of them.  Raditz only recognized the blue-haired girl who'd
been on the island from her hair and what was left of her clothes; her
face and body were nearly crushed to a pulp.
</I></p>
<p><I>Crack! Raditz looked up sharply to see Kakarott tossing Gohan's
body onto the top of the pile; the boy's head was twisted straight
back.
</I></p>
<p><I>Kakarott shrugged. "Sorry, I only had ninety-nine bodies before.
That makes one hundred."
</I></p>

<p>
Raditz woke up abruptly, heart pounding. He did not scream; he was a
Saiyan warrior and had better control of himself than that. But, damn!
He hated the nightmares.
<p>
Raditz sat up and mopped the sweat off his face with a swipe of his
arm. He took several deep breaths as he waited for his heart to calm
down, and then rose to his feet. As his eyes finished adjusting to the
dark, Raditz leaned against the wall and ran his hand across the rough,
stuccoed surface, reassuring himself of its reality. Sometimes he only
dreamed that he woke from the nightmares; sometimes he'd wake to find
himself back on Frieza's ship, or under the stars on some world he'd
purged, or, worst of all, back in the Guard barracks just before
Vegetasai exploded.
<p>
At least he eventually woke up from those nightmares, too. Life was
merciful that way; in Hell, there had been no waking from the
nightmare. But why now?  Why did he have nightmares now, and not for
all the years as Frieza's slave?
<p>
The small bedroom suddenly seemed both crowded and empty--it was small
and close like the berthing on Frieza's ship, and empty: just a plain,
unadorned sleeping chamber that meant nothing to him. It wasn't a
home, and it wasn't a good place to think.
<p>
Raditz padded barefoot across his small bedroom to the closet,
stopping to run his hand across the smooth wooden jamb. It was real;
he was awake. The big Saiyan pulled on briefs, bodysuit and armor and
walked over to the window and flung it open.  He breathed deeply,
inhaling the cool nighttime air and tasting all its myriad scents. The
sky was greying in the east as dawn approached. He looked back at the
small, dull room. Yeah. He had to get out of here.
<p>
Just before he left, he picked up the scouter from the nightstand;
he didn't work nights, but he was on call, and duty required him to
stay "in touch". The scouter's comm channel would have to suffice for
that.
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Gohan was restless, sleeping fitfully. "Too much excitement," his
mother would have said, and there was some truth to that. His birthday
was only two days away, and his dad would be here for his birthday for
the first time since--for the first time in a long time. Finally, just
before dawn, Gohan got up and got dressed; he just couldn't sleep
anymore.  He crept quietly outside to keep from disturbing the rest of
his family; the sky was grey with the hint of coming dawn.
<p>
!!!
<p>
What was that? A powerful ki flying southwest... Gohan concentrated on
it. Raditz, going somewhere in a hurry, not bothering to conceal his
ki. Gohan frowned; what could his less-than-favorite uncle be up to?
Gohan's own aura flickered to life, and he rose into the air, following
Raditz, his own ki low and quiet.
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz didn't try thinking, he just flew, enjoying the breeze across
his face, his hair whipping in the wind, and the fury of his own
energy driving him through the air at stratospheric jet speeds. He
didn't need to think, yet; instinct drew him back to the same place
every time. He arced high, and came down amid the mountains, down onto
a high grassy plateau.
<p>
Yeah, the same place: over there was the mountain with the notch
blasted through it, right here was the crater, and... Raditz circled
the crater--it was right here. He looked down; the grass was green and
lush and showed no trace of what had happened nearly nine years
ago. Slowly he sat down in the long grass, slowly he leaned back,
watching the sun rise.  He remembered the feel of that grass against
his cheek--it had been short, then, cropped back by the livestock that
once grazed here.
<p>
He'd never had nightmares as Frieza's slave--well, almost never, he
suddenly remembered. There was one nightmare that used to haunt him
when he was new there, and would recur from time to time. He'd dream
he was alone in the Palace corridors, or alone in the rooms of a
dimly remembered home--utterly alone. He'd run through endless empty
halls, or, if it was at home, run outside, calling for someone,
anyone--and there would be no one, anywhere. Just him, the only Saiyan
on an empty planet....
<p>
Raditz snorted. <i>That</i> nightmare had been obvious; but what about his
nightmares now?  Why did the evil he'd done haunt him <i>now</i>? Why
hadn't it given him nightmares back when he'd done it? Why'd he get a
free ride for twenty-five damned years only to wake up in Hell??
<p>
Because I didn't care back then. I didn't have nightmares about what I
did because it was nothing to me--and I ended up in Hell. Not that
<i>that</i> was all that much of a change--I told Vegeta when I met him in
Hell that we didn't have it too bad there. He saw it differently, I
think--but he came there from living free on a good world where his
wife and child and <i>other Saiyans</i> still lived! I had been the weakest
of the surviving Saiyans, despised by Vegeta for being the weakest,
barely tolerated by Nappa because I wasn't elite, hated by the
not-Saiyans because I was Saiyan, slave to Frieza and living in dread
of that monster's whims, alone and friendless and without hope. In
some ways, Hell was an improvement; I had friends there. In other
ways... at least in Frieza's service, I could sleep and escape the
waking nightmare that was my life.
<p>
The long-haired Saiyan laid down in the grass, looking up at the ripe
pink sky, hands behind his head. His tail stretched out and flexed in
the grass beside him.
<p>
He'd finally learned to listen to his heart, and it was tearing him
apart for thirty years of ignoring its silent counsel. Goku hadn't
warned him about this part--how could he?  Little brother had always
listened to his heart, and had little to regret. He couldn't know what
it was to have decades of cruelty and murder crushing one's soul.
<p>
I didn't have nightmares at first. When did it change? Raditz closed
his eyes, thinking--and did not see the streak of light plummeting
toward him.
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
What is he doing? Gohan wondered as he spotted Raditz stretched out
full-length on the ground. This is a long way to come just to relax
and watch the sunrise! I can't believe he hasn't noticed me yet.
<p>
Gohan descended slowly, his gaze taking in the surrounding mountains,
the grassy tableland, the round hollow that looked like a
crater... Gohan suddenly realized it <i>was</i> a crater; he looked around
more carefully. A chill ran up and down his spine; he'd been here
before.
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
A familiar ki intruded on Raditz's thoughts, and a shadow crossed his
face. His eyes flicked open--
<p>
"Th-th-this is where..." Gohan's voice shook.  The boy stood beside
him, looking toward the crater.
<p>
"Yes," Raditz said, raising himself on one elbow, his black hair a
blanket underneath him. "We died here." He looked intently at Gohan,
one eyebrow raised.
<p>
Gohan's hands balled into fists; anger and other less-identifiable
emotions chased each other across his face. "How--how can you stand to
come here?"
<p>
Raditz's brows lowered. "Perhaps I should ask you the same question,
nephew--"
<p>
"Don't call me that!" Gohan snapped.
<p>
The big Saiyan shrugged. "It's the truth... but no matter. As for
me..." Raditz looked around. "Such a vivid reminder of my own
foolishness helps me focus my thoughts on... less foolish things."
<p>
He sounds <i>tired</i>, and kind of sad, Gohan thought. He looked into the
upturned face and wide Saiyan eyes of his father's older brother, and
wondered at the sadness lurking there.
<p>
Gohan clenched and un-clenched his fists. His earliest bad memories
had been of being grabbed by the large, menacing Saiyan and taken far
away from his pleading father to be locked up, seemingly forgotten.  He
still remembered the leap of joy when he heard his Dad telling him to
be strong, that Dad would rescue him--then came the terrifying sound
of his father's screams of pain. He couldn't remember too well what
happened after that, just his insensate rage and terror and things
exploding around him. He hurt Raditz badly.

<p>
Then later Piccolo told him Dad was dead, and he was alone, so alone
in the wilderness. No mother to hold him and to wipe away his tears
and tell him it would be all right, no father to tell him how proud he
was of him... and all his nightmares were about Raditz. It wasn't
until later, when they were training, that Piccolo happened to tell
Gohan that his evil uncle was dead as well.

<p>
After the evils of Frieza and Cell, and the terrible price paid to
defeat Cell, Gohan had all but forgotten his dead and unmourned
uncle--only to face him suddenly and unexpectedly in a haunted
Japanese village less than a year ago. Raditz was his first,
worst childhood nightmare returned to life; Gohan's only thought had
been to use the strength that had destroyed Cell and put an end to his
old nightmare once and for all--
<p>
--and his little brother Goten had leaped into the arms of his
nightmare, shouting a familiar, mysterious greeting: "NUNK RATS! NUNK
RATS FUN!"--mysterious no longer. And his father's evil brother told
him, "I'm not your enemy; I'm here to protect Bulma and Trunks," and
everything had been turned inside out.
<p>
Raditz took Gohan's long silence as another question, and continued,
"I was tested here, in honor, courage, strength and wisdom--and I
failed badly." He looked away briefly. "I learned a lot
from that failure--more than I ever did from victory."

<p>
Gohan's sharp ears caught the rough note in Raditz's
voice. He's--<i>sorry</i>? Raditz's next words confirmed it.

<p>
"I didn't... It shouldn't have happened that way." Raditz closed his
eyes and looked away again; his voice was hoarse.
<p>
Gohan sat down abruptly, still watching Raditz. He'd gotten to
thinking of Raditz as like Vegeta--cold, dark-hearted, not a person
Gohan could like, but someone to be tolerated for Bulma's sake, and as
an ally against worse evils. Gohan had felt pity for Vegeta just
once--when he watched helplessly as Frieza brutally murdered the
Saiyan Prince, and the broken, weeping Vegeta had begged Goku to
avenge him--and never afterwards.
<p>
Gohan had put his feelings about Raditz aside to save Bulma and Trunks and
his little brother Goten from the Opawang--but had he needed to? What
were Gohan's feelings? He'd watched Raditz die after throwing himself
between Bulma and the Opawang, and he'd found himself respecting
Raditz's courage, and hating the Opawang for killing him. He, Gohan,
had been sorry that his once-cruel uncle was dead; somehow, sometime
Raditz had stopped being one of the very small group of people that
Gohan was happy to see dead and had become one of the vast majority of
people that the gentle-souled boy hated to see hurt.
<p>
That didn't mean he liked Raditz; it just meant that Raditz was a
person, and not a monster any more. Gohan's nature was to care
about people, whether he knew them or not, whether he liked them or
not. He didn't like to see even bad people hurt; he just wanted them
to stop doing bad things. And... hadn't Raditz stopped doing evil?
<p>
"But it did." Gohan finally spoke.
<p>
Raditz drew himself to a sitting position, shaking his hair loose and
curling his tail around his waist as he did so. "Yes, it did," he
agreed, still not meeting Gohan's eyes.
<p>
Raditz spoke, seemingly at random. "I don't know exactly how Vegetasai
years translate into Earth years, but a long time ago I was that age
where you're considered an adult, but you don't feel like one--still
awkward and not yet at my full strength, but expected to be
responsible and capable and strong and not having a clue how to be."
The big Saiyan drew in a deep breath, and exhaled. "Kinoko--my
mother--died badly purging a world just a few months before, and
father did not accept it as a warrior should. He had me sent
away on a long-distance scouting mission--my first--because I reminded
him too much of her." He glanced at Gohan, who was listening
intently. "I look like her, you know, and little brother looks just
like father." Raditz sighed, looking away again. "So after months out
on the back edge of nowhere, with no report from father or anyone,
Frieza's ship picked me up, and I found out that everyone was dead and
there was no home anymore."
<p>
Raditz finally looked Gohan in the eye. "You, too, have been orphaned
and alone, with no way home," the big Saiyan said abruptly.
<p>
He knows! The sudden realization struck Gohan--somehow he knows what
happened to me afterwards! But no, that's impossible--he was
dead. Even Dad didn't know how alone and miserable I was. And
yet... Gohan abruptly understood; this was Raditz's way of telling
Gohan that he regretted the sorrow he'd caused the boy. But...
<p>
Gohan's eyes were wide. "How did you know?"
<p>
Raditz looked away again, and then stared at his hands for a while
before speaking. "Every tear that I caused to be shed, every cry for
mercy that I scorned, every consequence of every evil deed I ever did
was a witness against me when I was Judged. I know what I did, <i>all</i>
of it; I will always know." He lifted haunted eyes to meet Gohan's
steady gaze. "Be grateful, nephew, that you were not born a Saiyan on
Vegetasai!"
<p>
The long-maned Saiyan turned away, whispering so quietly that Gohan
could barely hear: "We have so much to answer for."
<p>
So many thoughts and feelings churned through Gohan's mind: his
lingering dislike of his uncle--yes, his <i>uncle</i>; the stark
understanding that Raditz regretted the evil he'd done; his own
guilt... Gohan wrapped his arms around himself and stared at the
ground, remembering listening to Mom cry herself to sleep night after
night after... after Cell, and knowing it was his fault that Dad was
dead. If only he hadn't given in to his hatred of Cell! It shouldn't
have happened that way!
<p>
Gohan looked up at Raditz, mouth hanging open, startled by his own
realization; his eyes met the Saiyan's own puzzled gaze. If only he
hadn't given into anger and his hatred of Cell... Dad wouldn't have
died-- and if only Raditz hadn't given into his own anger, Dad
wouldn't have died! Everything stood out in perfect clarity for a
long, silent moment.
<p>
Dad forgave me... and in the end, he forgave Raditz. But... Gohan
reflected briefly on the loss and loneliness of first few months in
the wilderness, of his terror at hearing his father's agony, of the
anger he'd held in his heart long enough to throw in Cell's face
nearly six years later... <i>I</i> never forgave Raditz. And Raditz
never... no. I don't know that.
<p>
Gohan said hesitantly, "I hurt you, I think, when I was young. I don't
remember it very well..." He trailed off, not sure what he meant to
ask.
<p>
Raditz's eyes widened a fraction. "You don't remember?  Ah. I remember
it... very well." The big Saiyan leaned forward slightly, and
frowned. "You hit me harder than anyone had ever hit me in one
blow--damn near killed me outright. You did crack my
breastbone--because of that injury, I couldn't pull myself free of
Goku's hold."
<p>
"And you hated me for that." Gohan was sure enough to state it as
fact. Raditz's answer surprised him.
<p>
Raditz looked at him quizzically. "No, not really. I was half-mad
from pain and battle-rage at the time, but," he smiled that wicked
Saiyan smile, "I was proud of you, too.  Kakarott was such a
disappointment--weak and <i>tailless</i>," Raditz almost spat the word,
"but you--your power staggered me. You had the power of a first-class
Saiyan warrior at an impossibly young age; I was proud that you were
my nephew."
<p>
The big Saiyan lowered his voice. "I found out I was as wrong about
Goku as I had been about your power very shortly afterwards--and so
died. But I could not hate my little brother for his courage; I
respected that. The only ones guilty of my blood are Piccolo, for
striking the death blow, and myself, through folly," Raditz snarled
softly.
<p>
He never held it against me? Gohan wondered. Raditz--Raditz!--forgave
<i>me</i> before he even died, and all these years I've held on to my
hatred and never forgiven him. Gohan stared at the ground, unable to
look Raditz in the eye and was deeply ashamed. I couldn't let go of my
hatred of Cell and I did the same thing I couldn't forgive Raditz
for--I tortured my opponent instead of doing what I should have
done. Both of us cost Dad his life.
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Raditz wondered at the gamut of emotions roiling Gohan's ki. What does
he struggle with? He's too young, and too innocent for such guilt as
mine--no regrets, no nightmares of slaughter for him. Raditz
remembered the terrified child he'd kidnapped so long ago, and the
bitter loneliness of the boy's desert exile--every tear he wept had
seared Raditz's damned soul, and added another regret.
<p>
He knows that now, but it doesn't wipe away the pain
he's carried all this time, does it? I well earned his hatred! Yet he
set it aside to fight beside me against the Opawang and
Cacodemon--little brother indeed has a son to be proud of.
<p>
I understand now; the nightmares started when I--when they became
people instead of targets. They will always be with me; they are price
of my deeds--but a lighter price than I have already paid.
<CENTER><P>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P></CENTER>
<p>
Gohan started to stand up; his shadow stretched out across the field as the
morning sun rose behind him. "Raditz, I, um---"
<p>
A brief flicker-flash of light alerted Gohan, and suddenly Goku
appeared, two fingers still touching his forehead. He looked slightly
surprised to see the two of them.
<p>
"Um, Gohan--"
<p>
"Dad!" Gohan jumped to his feet with a shout of welcome.  "What--?"
<p>
Raditz merely raised one eyebrow in silence. He regarded Goku calmly
from his place on the grass.
<p>
Goku frowned slightly. "Raditz, why did you bring Gohan out here
without telling anyone? Chi-chi has been worried sick ever since she
got up and found Gohan missing."
<p>
"Raditz didn't do anything!" Gohan interjected, "I followed him here."
The rest of Goku's words penetrated, and Gohan looked sheepish. "Mom's
up already? Oh man, I'm in trouble--" Gohan's stomach growled. "--I
hope I don't miss breakfast!"

<p>
Goku put one hand behind his head. "Ah, you know how your mother has
been ever since Goten was kidnapped; you shouldn't worry her so
much. She was really scared when you didn't show up for breakfast."

<p>
Gohan smacked himself. "Oh man, I didn't think about it! Can you take
me back right away, Dad?" He glanced at Raditz, suddenly
thoughtful. "Dad, is there any breakfast left?"
<p>
Goku looked sheepish. "Chi-chi wouldn't let me eat until I'd found
you, but we'd better hurry--she might make us eat cold oatmeal!"

<p>
The look on Gohan's face at the thought of having to eat cold, gray,
congealed oatmeal was so comical that Goku burst out laughing; even
Raditz couldn't hide a smile.

<p>
"It won't be <i>that</i> bad, I promise!" Goku finally said as he raised to
fingers to his forehead. "But we'd better get back right now."

<p>
"Wait! Dad, can we--," Gohan paused and regarded Raditz. "Uncle
Raditz, would you come home with us and have breakfast?"

<p>
Raditz got to his feet, a barely-hidden smile quirking his
lips. "Yes, I think I will."
<p>
