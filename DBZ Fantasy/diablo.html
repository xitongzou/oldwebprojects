WARRIOR
The Warriors of the lands of Khanduras  are well trained in all of the weapons of war.  Ranging
from  crusading paladins to unscrupulous mercenaries,  Warriors can be found  wherever there is
conflict  amongst their countrymen.  Many of these adventuresome men  joined with King Leoric's
army  and went to battle against the Northern kingdom of Westmarch.  As the fires of war burned
themselves out, these Warriors returned home to find their kingdom is shattered disarray.
Dark rumors  of the mysterious demise of King Leoric abound and the evil that lurks  within his
Cathedral  has drawn many Warriors  to Khanduras seeking fortune and glory.  Though  they  were
warned  by the people of Tristram,  a few of these brave souls  have ventured  into the chaotic
labyrnth beneath the old church - never to be heard from again...
Whether  they are driven by valor,  honor,  madness or greed,  new Warriors  arrive in Tristram
every day, ready to challenger the dark unknown that awaits them beneath the earth.
The Warrior is the strongest and toughest of the three available Classes,  and he excels in the
art  of close combat.  His primary weakness is  that  his extensive physical training  has left
little time to develop more than a rudimentary knowledge of magic. The extended periods of time
that most Warriors spend away  from their homes and civilization  requires  that they learn  to
repair  their own weapons and armor,  although their skill is no match for the talent of a true
blacksmith.

ROGUE
The Sisters of the Sightless Eye are a loosely organized guild  shrouded in mystery amongst the
peoples of the West.  These  highly skilled archers  employ  ancient Eastern philosophies  that
develop an  "inner-sight"  that they use both in combat and to circumvent dangerous traps  that
they may encounter.  Known only  as wandering Rogues in the West,  the  Sisters  conceal  their
secret affiliation  by posing as simple travelers.  Many pompous fools have made the mistake of
underestimating these steel nerved women in combat and paid a terrible price for their vanity.
The strange events  transpiring in Khanduras have caught the attention of many of these Rogues.
They have come from as far as the Eastern dunes to test their skills against the dark evil that
is said to be lurking in Tristram. It is also believed that untold riches wait to be discovered
among the ruins of the Horadrim monastery.
Although not as powerful in close combat as the Warrior,  the Rogue is the undisputed master of
the bow.  A skilled Sister  can send  a stream of arrows  at an opponent,  each  fired  with  a
seemingly  careless precision.  The innate sixth sense  that  all Rogues  seem to possess  also
allows them to sense trapped fixtures, and aids them in attempts to disarm these traps.

SORCERER
Although  practitioners  of the mystic arts  are scarce  within  the  often  superstitious  and
religious lands of the West,  many magi  have made the pilgrimage from the Far East  to see for
themselves what horros lie beneath the ruined Cathedral of Khanduras. The veiled Brotherhood of
the Vizjerei,  one of the eldest and most dominant mage-clans of the East, has sent many of its
acolytes to observe the dark events unfolding in Khanduras first hand.
The Vizjerei, known  for their brightly colored turinash - or spirit robes - have taken  a keen
interst  in both gathering knowledge of demons  and seeing them slain. The Vizjerei elders hope
that their acolytes will learn the secrets of the dark evil that they sense growing in the West
and can destroy it.  The possibility of discovering long-lost tomes of magical knowledge within
the confines of the labyrinth has also captured the interest of many wandering Sorcerers.
Most magic in Khanduras  is in the form of enchanted items  and elixirs.  The Eastern Sorcerers
have  developed  a greater understanding  of spellcasting  than the other classes,  and while a
Vizjerei neonate knows  only the simplest of spells to start,  he can expert to rapidly grow in
power  as he discovers new incantations.  All Sorcerers possess the ablility  to recharge spell
staves by drawing power from their surroundings and channeling them through the staff.

BOOK OF BLOOD (Quest : Valor)
...and so,  locked beyond the  Gateway of Blood and past the hall of Fire, Valor awaits for the
 hero of light to awaken...

BOOK OF THE BLIND (Quest : Halls of the Blind)
I can see what you see not.
Vision milky then eyes rot.
When you turn they will be gone,
whispering their hidden song.
Then you see what cannot be,
shadows move where light should be.
Out of darkness, out of mind,
cast down into the Halls of the Blind.

MYTHICAL BOOK (Quest : Chamber of the Bone)
Beyond the  Hall of Heroes lies the Chamber of Bone. Eternal death awaits any who would seek to
steal the  treasures  secured  within  this  room.  So speaks the Lord of terror,  and so it is
written.

STEEL TOME (Quest : Warlord of Blood)
The armories of Hell are home to the Warlord of Blood.  In his wake lay the mutilated bodies of
thousands.  Angels and man alike  have been cut down  to fulfill his endless sacrifices  to the
dark ones who scream for one thing - blood.

TALE OF THE THREE
Glory and approbation to  Diablo - Lord of Terror and leader of the Three.  My lord spoke to me
of  his  two  brothers,  Mephisto and Baal,  who were banished to this world long ago.  My lord
wishes to bide time and harness his awesome power so that he may free his captive brothers from
their tombs beneath the sands of the East. Once my lord releases his brothers, the Sin War will
once again know the fury of the Three.

THE BINDING OF THE THREE
So it  came  that  the  three  prime evils were banished in spirit form to the mortal realm and
after  sewing  chaos  across the east for decades, they were hunted down by the cursed order of
the  mortal Horadrim.  The Horadrim used artifacts called  Soulstones to contain the essence of
Mephisto,  the  Lord  of  Hatred and his brother  Baal, the  Lord of Destruction. The  youngest
brother - Diablo, the Lord of Terror - escaped to the west.
Eventually  the  Horadrim  captured Diablo within a Soulstones as well, and buried him under an
ancient,  forgotten  cathedral.  There,  the  Lord  of Terror sleeps and awaits the time of his
rebirth. Know  ye  that he will seek a body of youth and power to posses - one that is innocent
and easily controlled.  He will then arise to free his brothers and once more fan the flames of
the Sin War...

THE BLACK KING
Hail  and  sacrifice  to Diablo - Lord of Terror and destroyer of souls. When I awoke my master
from his sleep,  he attempted to possess a mortal's form. Diablo attempted to claim the body of
King Leoric,  but my master was too weak  from his imprisonment.  My lord required a simple and
innocent anchor to this world, and so found the boy Albrecht to be perfect for the task.  While
the good King Leoric was left maddened by Diablo's unsuccessful possession, I kidnapped his son
Albrecht  and brought him  before my master.  I now await Diablo's call and pray that I will be
rewarded when he at last emerged as the lord of this world.

THE DARK EXILE
So it came to be that there was a great revolution within the  Burning Hells known as the  Dark
Exile.  The lesser evils overthrew the three prime evils and banished their spirit forms to the
mortal realm.  The demons Belial  (The Lord of Lies) and  Azmodan  (The Lord of Sin)  fought to
claim rulership of Hell during the absence of the Three Brothers. All of Hell polarized between
the factions of  Belial and  Azmodan while the forces of the  High Heavens continually battered
upon the very gates of Hell.

THE GREAT CONFLICT
Take heed and bear witness  to the truths  that lie herein, for they are the last legacy of the
Horadrim.  There is a war that rages on even now,  beyond the fields that we know - between the
Utopian  Kingdoms of the  High Heavens and the chaotic  Pits of the  Burning Hells. This war is
known as the  Great Conflict,  and it has  raged and burned longer than any of the stars in the
sky.  Neither side ever gains sway for long  as the forces of light and darkness constantly vie
for control over all creation.

THE REALMS BEYOND
All praises to  Diablo - Lord of Terror  and survivor of the  Dark Exile. When he awakened from
his long slumber,  my lord and master spoke to me  of secrets that few mortals know. He told me
the  Kingdoms of the  High Heavens and the  Pits of the Burning Hells engage in an eternal war.
He  revealed the powers that have brought this discord to the realms of man.  My lord has named
the battle for this world and all who exist here the Sin War.

THE SIN WAR
Many  demons  traveled  to  the mortal realm in search of the Three Brothers. These demons were
followed  to the mortal plane by angels who hunted them throughout the vast cities of the East.
The  angels  allied  themselves  with a secretive order  of mortal magi named the Horadrim, who
quickly became adept at hunting demons. They also made many dark enemies in the underworlds.

THE TALE OF THE HORADRIM
Take  heed  and bear witness to the truths that lie herein, for they are the last legacy of the
Horadrim.  Nearly  three  hundred years ago,  it came to be known that the three prime evils of
the  Burning  Hells had mysteriously come to our world. The Three Brothers ravaged the lands of
the east for decades, while humanity was left trembling in their wake. Our order - the Horadrim
- was founded by a group  of secretive  Magi to hunt down  and capture the three evils once and
for all.
The  original  Horadrim captured two of the three within powerful artifacts known as Soulstones
and buried them deep bneath the desolate eastern sands. The third evil escaped capture and fled
to the west with many of the Horadrim in pursuit. The third evil - known as Diablo, the Lord of
Terror - was  eventually  captured,  his  essence  set  in  a  Soulstone and buried within this
labyrinth.
Be warned that the Soulstone  must be kept from discovery  by those not of the faith. If Diablo
were to be released, he would seek a body that is easily controlled as he would be very weak -
perhaps that of an old man or a child.

THE WAGES OF SIN ARE WAR
Take  heed  and bear witness to the truths that lie herein, for they are the last legacy of the
Horadrim.  When  the eternal conflict between the High Heavens and the Burning Hells falls upon
mortal soil,  it is called the Sin War.  Angels  and  Demons walk amongst humanity in disguise,
fighting  in  secret,  away from the prying eyes of mortals.  Some daring, powerful mortal have
even allied themselves with either side, and helped to dictate the course of the Sin War.

                               BOOK I : OF HEAVEN AND HELL

THE GREAT CONFLICT
     Since the beginning, the forces of Light and Darkness have engaged in an eternal war : The
Great  Conflict,  whose  victor  will  rise  from  the  apocalyptic ashes to hold sway over all
creation. To this end, the Angels of the High Heavens adhere to strict militaristic disciplines
Seraphim warriors  strike at the enemies of Light  with swords  imbued with righteous wrath and
justice.  The Angels believe that only  absolute discipline  can properly restore order  to the
myriad realms,  while the demonic denizens of the Burning Hells hold that absolute chaos is the
true nature of all things.
     The battles of the  Great Conflict rage across both time and space,  often infringing upon
the very fabric of reality itself.  From the Crystal Arch at the very heart of the High Heavens
to the arcane  Hellforge of the  Underworld,  the warriors  of these eternal realms  journey to
wherever their timeless conflict carries them.  The legendary deeds of the heroes of the realms
beyond elicit both veneration and insight.
     The greatest of these heroes was Izual,  lieutenant to the Arch-Angel Tyrael and bearer of
the Angelic  Runeblade  Azurewrath.  He  once  led  a  fierce  attack upon the Hellforge as the
creation of the dark demonblade Shadowfang was nearing completion.  His  quest  was  to destroy
both  wielder  and weapon - a charge that he was destined never to complete. Izual was overcome
by  the  legions  of  chaos  and,  tragically,  was  lost  to the Darkness.  His fate stands as
testament to the fact that  Angels and Demons alike shall fearlessly enter into any domain - so
long as their hated enemies dwell within.
     Although  the  Great  Conflict  burned hotter and longer than any of the stars in the sky,
neither side could gain dominion over the other for long. Both factions sought some way to turn
the tides of the war to their favor. With the ascension of Man and his mortal realm,  the Great
Conflict ground to a mysterious halt. Both armies paused in a breathless stalemate,  waiting to
see to whose side Man would eventually turn.
     Mortals had the unique ability to choose between Darkness and Light,  and it was held that
this would be the deciding factor in the outcome of the Great Conflict. Thus, the agents of the
nether-realms descended to the mortal realm to vie for the favor of Man...

THE SIN WAR
     The coming of the  Great Conflict to the mortal realm is known as the Sin War.  Angels and
Demons,  disguising themselves while traveling amongst men,  attempted to secretly lure mortals
to their respective causes. Over time, the forces of Darkness discovered that mortals responded
much more to brute force than to subtle coercion, and so began to terrorize Man into submission
The Angels  fought to defend humanity against this demonic oppression,  but all too often their
austere methods  and severe punishments succeeded only in  alienating those whom they sought to
protect.
     The violent battles of the Sin War occurred often,  but they were seldom witnessed  by the
prying eyes of Man.  Only a few  "enlightened" souls were aware of the supernatural beings that
walked  amongst  the  huddled  masses  of  humanity.  Powerful  mortals  arose and accepted the
challenge  of the Sin War,  allying themselves  with  both sides  in the  Great  Conflict.  The
legendary deeds  of these  great mortal warriors  served to earn both the respect and hatred of
the netherworlds.  Although lesser demons  kneeled before those possessing power  and strength,
they also cursed  the very existence  of mortal man.  Many  of these fiends believed  that  the
deadlock brought about by the emergence of Man was a perverse offense to their "higher" role in
the great scheme of things.
     This jealousy of Man  led to harsh,  atrocious acts of violence  by the demons against the
mortal  realm.  Some men learned of this deep hatred  and used it  against the denizens  of the
Underworld.  One  such  mortal,  Horazon  the Summoner,  delighted in summoning demons and then
breaking them to his will.  Horazon, along with his brother Bartuc, were members of the Eastern
mage clan known as the Vizjerei. This mystic clan studied the ways of demons and had catalogued
their lore for generations.  Empowered by this knowledge,  Horazon was able to take the work of
the Vizjerei  and pervert it  for his  demented purposes.  The denizens of Hell  sought revenge
against this bold mortal,  but Horazon managed to keep himself well protected within his arcane
sanctuary.
     Bartuc,  the brother  of Horazon,  was eventually  lured to the side  of Darkness.  He was
granted  exceptional  strength and longevity,  and fought alongside the legions of Hell against
the cursed  Vizjerei,  and eventually  his own brother during the Sin War.  Although Bartuc was
renowned  amongst the warriors  of many realms,  his dominance  in battle  came with a terrible
price.  An insatiable lust  for mortal blood  pervaded his every thought and deed.  Bartuc soon
became as fond of bathing in the blood of his enemies as he did of shedding it,  and in time he
came to be known only as the Warlord of Blood.

THE DARK EXILE
     "Seven is the number of the powers of Hell, and Seven is the number of the Great Evils."

                               Duriel, the Lord of Pain

                           Andariel, the Maiden of Anguish

                              Belial, the Lord of Lies

                              Azmodan, the Lord of Sin

     These are the true names  of the lesser of the  Great Evils.  For ages uncounted each have
ruled over their own domains  within the Burning Hells,  seeking  absolute dominion  over their
infernal brethren.  As the Lesser Four  continuously vied  for the control of those forces that
dwelled within their realms, the  Greater Three held absolute power over the whole of Hell. The
Lesser Four used dark and evil measures in their quest for power,  and herein begins the legend
of the Exile.

                            Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred

                            Baal, the Lord of Destruction

                             Diablo, the Lord of Terror

     These  are  the  Prime  Evils  of  Hell  that  wielded  their  power as a dark,  sovereign
triumvirate.  The  Three  Brothers  ruled  over  the  Lesser Four by brutal force and malicious
cunning.  Being the eldest and strongest of the Evils,  the Three Brothers were responsible for
countless victories  against  the armies of the Light.  Although they never held sway over  the
High Heavens for long, the Three were justly feared by enemies and subjects alike.
     With the ascension of  Man and the subsequent standstill of the Great Conflict,  the Three
Brothers  began to devote their energies to the perversion of mortal souls.  The Three realized
that Man  was the key to victory  in the war against  Heaven,  and  thus  altered  their  rigid
agendum  that they had propagated  since the Beginning.  This change  caused many of the Lesser
Evils  to question  the authority of the Three,  and so brought about  a great rift between the
Prime Evils and their servitors.
     In their ignorance,  the   Lesser Evils  began to believe that  the  Three  were afraid to
continue the war  with Heaven.  Frustrated by the cessation of the war,  Azmodan and Belial saw
the situation  as their chance  to overthrow  the  Prime  Evils  and  take control of Hell  for
themselves.  The two demon lords made a pact with their minor brethren,  assuring them that the
wretched plague of humanity would not deter  the ultimate victory of the sons of Hell.  Azmodan
and Belial  devised a plan to end the stalemate,  achieve victory in the Sin War and ultimately
ride the bloody crest of the  Great Conflict straight into the very arms of Armageddon. Thus, a
great revolution was set into motion as all of Hell went to war against the Three Brothers...
     The Brothers  fought with all  of the savagery  of the Underworld,  and  to  their credit,
annihilated a third of Hell's treacherous legions.  In the end, however,  they were overcome by
the Horned Death led by the traitors Azmodan and Belial. The Prime Evils, weakened and bodiless
were banished to the mortal realm  where Azmodan hoped that  they would remain trapped forever.
Azmodan  believed that  with the Three set loose  upon humanity,  the Angels would be forced to
turn their focus upon on the mortal plane - thus leaving the  Gates  of  Heaven  abandoned  and
defenseless. Those few demons who still pledged allegiance to the Three Brothers fled the wrath
of Azmodan and Belial, escaping to the realm of Man to seek out their lost Masters.
     As the warfires died out upon the battlefields of Hell,  Azmodan and Belial began to argue
over which of them held the higher authority. The pact that they had made quickly fell to ashes
as the two demon lords took up arms against each other.  The legions of Hell that remained were
polarized behind either warlord,  launching themselves into a bloody civil war  that has lasted
to this day...

THE BINDING OF THE THREE
     In the ancient days,  before  the rise  of the  Western Empires,  the  dark  and  terrible
entities known as  the Three Evils  were exiled  to the world of Man.  These  eternal  entities
wandered throughout the waking world and fed upon the lusts of men, leaving chaos and attrition
in their wake.  The Evils  turned father against son and prompted many great nation into brutal
and petty wars.  Their Exile from Hell  left them with an insatiable hunger  to bring suffering
and pain to all who would not kneel before them, and so the Three Brothers ravaged the lands of
the Far East for countless centuries.
     Eventually,  a secretive order of mortal magi was gathered together by the enigmatic Arch-
Angel Tyrael.  These sorcerers  were to hunt  the Three Evils  and put an end  to their vicious
rampage.  The order,  known as the Horadrim, consisted of wizards from the diverse and numerous
mage-clans of the East.  Employing disparate magical practices  and disciplines,  this unlikely
Brotherhood  succeeded  in capturing  two of the Brothers  within  a powerful artifacts  called
Soulstones.  Mephisto and Baal,  trapped  within the swirling,  spiritual  constraints  of  the
Soulstones, were then buried beneath the dunes of the desolate Eastern Sands.
     The powers of  Hatred and wanton  Destruction  seemed to diminish in the East as a nervous
peace  began to settle over the land.  Yet,  for many decades the Horadrim continued their grim
search for the third Brother,  Diablo.  They knew that if  the Lord of Terror  was left untamed
there could never be any lasting peace within the realm of humanity.
     The Horadrim followed in the wake of terror and anarchy that spread throughout the Western
lands. After a great battle which claimed the lives of many brave souls, the Lord of Terror was
captured  and imprisoned  within the last of the Soulstones by a group of Horadrim monks led by
the  Initiate Jered Cain.  These monks  carried  the cursed stone to the land of Khanduras  and
buried it  within  a secluded cave  near  the river Talsande.  Above  this  cave  the  Horadrim
constructed  a great Monastery  from which they could continue  to safeguard the Soulstone.  As
ages passed, the Horadrim constructed a network of catacombs beneath the Monastery to house the
earthly remains of the martyrs of their Order.
     Generation passed in Khanduras,  and the numbers of the Horadrim slowly dwindled.  With no
quests  left to undertake,  and too few sons  to sustain their guardianship,  the once powerful
Order faded into obscurity.  Eventually,  the great Monastery that they had built fell to ruins
as well.  Although villages grew and thrived around the shell of the old Monastery, no one knew
of the dark, secret passageways that stretched into the cold earth beneath it.  None could have
dreamed of the burning red gem that pulsed within the labyrinth's heart...


                              BOOK II : THE RETURN OF TERROR

THE LANDS OF KHANDURAS
     Years after the last of the Horadrim had died,  a great and prosperous society grew in the
lands of the West.  As time wore on,  many  Eastern pilgrims  settled  in the lands surrounding
Khanduras and soon establish small,  self contained kingdoms.  A few of these kingdoms bickered
with  Khanduras  over holdings of  property or routes of trade.  These squabbles  did little to
upset the lasting peace of the West, and the great Northern kingdom of Westmarch proved to be a
strong ally of Khanduras as the two lands steadily engaged in ventures of barter and commerce.
     During this time,  a bold,  new religion  of the Light  known as Zakarum  began to  spread
throughout  the kingdom of Westmarch  and into many  of its northern  principalities.  Zakarum,
founded  in the Far East,  implored followers to enter  into the Light and forsake the darkness
that lurked within their souls. The people of Westmarch adopted the statues of Zakarum as their
sacred mission in the world.  Westmarch began to turn towards its neighbors,  expecting them to
embrace this  "New Beginning"  as well.  Tensions rose  between  the kingdoms of Westmarch  and
Khanduras  as the priests  of Zakarum  began to preach  their foreign dogma  whether  they were
welcomed or not.
     It was then that  the great northern lord Leoric came unto the lands of Khanduras and,  in
the name of Zakarum,  declared himself King,  Leoric was a deeply religious man and had brought
many Knights and Priests with him that comprised his Order of the Light. Leoric and his trusted
advisor,  the Arch Bishop Lazarus,  made their way to the city of Tristram. Leoric appropriated
the ancient,  decrepit Monastery  on the outskirts  of the town  for  his  seat  of  power  and
renovated it  to match  its time-lost glory.  Although  the free people  of Khanduras  were not
pleased  with being placed  under the sudden rule  of a foreign King, Leoric  served them  with
justice and might. Eventually, the people of Khanduras grew to respect the kind Leoric, sensing
that he sough only to guide and protect them against the oppression of Darkness.

THE AWAKENING
     Not long after  Leoric took possession  of Khanduras,  a power long asleep awakened within
the dark recesses  beneath the Monastery.  Sensing that freedom  was within  his grasp,  Diablo
entered the nightmares of the Arch Bishop and lured him into the dark,  subterranean labyrinth.
In his terror,  Lazarus raced  throughout  the abandoned hallways  until he at last came to the
chamber  of the burning Soulstone.  No longer  in command of his body or spirit,  he raised the
stone  above his head  and uttered words  long forgotten  in the realms  of mortals.  His  will
destroyed,  Lazarus shattered  the Soulstone  upon the ground.  Diablo once again came into the
world of Man. Although he was released from his imprisonment within the Soulstone,  the Lord of
Terror was still greatly weakened from his long sleep and required an anchor to the world. Once
he had found a mortal form to wear,  he could begin  to reclaim his vastly depleted power.  The
great demon weighed  the souls residing in the town above, and chose to take  the strongest  of
them - that of King Leoric.
     For many months  King Leoric  secretly fought  the evil presence that twisted his thoughts
and emotions.  Sensing that  he had been possessed  by some unknown evil.  Leoric  hid his dark
secret  from his Priests,  hoping that somehow  his own devout righteousness would be enough to
exorcise  that corruption growing inside him - he was sorely mistaken. Diablo stripped away the
core of  Leoric's being,  burning away  all honor  and virtue  from his soul.  Lazarus too, had
fallen  under the sway  of the Demon,  keeping close  to Leoric at all times. Lazarus worked to
conceal  the plans  of his new Master  from the Order of Light,  hoping that  the demon's power
would grow, well concealed amongst the servants of Zakarum.
     The priests of Zakarum  and the citizenry of Khanduras  recognized  the disturbing  change
within their liege.  His once proud  and rugged form became distorted and deformed. King Leoric
became increasingly deranged and ordered immediate executions of any  who dared to question his
methods  or  authority.  Leoric began  to send his Knights  to other villages  to  bully  their
townspeople into submission.  The people of Khanduras  who had once grown to see great honor in
their ruler began to call Leoric the Black King.
     Driven  to the brink  of madness  by the Lord of Terror,  King Leoric slowly alienated his
closest friends  and advisors,  Lachdanan,  Captain  of the Knight  of the Order  of Light  and
honored Champion  of Zakarum,  tried to discern  the nature of his King's deteriorating spirit.
Yet  at every turn  the Arch-Bishop Lazarus  would  waylay  Lachdanan  and  admonish  him  from
questioning  the actions  of the King.  As  tensions  grew  between  the two,  Lazarus  charged
Lachdanan with treason against the Kingdom.  To the Priests and Knights of Leoric's court,  the
prospect of Lachdanan committing treason was ridiculous. Lachdanan's motives were honorable and
just, and soon many began question the reason of their once beloved King.
     Leoric's madness was growing more obvious with each passing day. Sensing that the advisors
of the court  were becoming  increasingly suspicious  of  foul treachery,  Lazarus  desperately
sought  to contain  the eroding situation. The Arch-Bishop masterfully convinced the delusional
Leoric  that the kingdom of Westmarch  was plotting against him,  secretly planning to dethrone
him and annex Khanduras  into its own lands.  Leoric flew into a rage and summoned his advisors
to his side.  Manipulated by the Arch-Bishop, the paranoid King declared a state of war between
the kingdoms of Khanduras and Westmarch.
     Leoric ignored  the warnings and admonishments  of his  advisors and  the  royal  army  of
Khanduras  was ordered to the North to engage in a war that they did not believe in.  Lachdanan
was appointed  by Lazarus  to lead  the armies of Khanduras into Westmarch.  Although Lachdanan
argued the against the necessity of the coming conflict,  he was honor-bound to uphold the will
of his King.  Many of the  high-priests and officials  were forced  to travel  to the North  as
emissaries  on errands  of diplomatic urgency,  as well.  The desperate  ploy  of  Lazarus  had
succeeded in sending many of the King's more 'troublesome' advisors to their certain deaths...

THE DARKENING OF TRISTRAM
     The absence  of prying advisors  and inquisitive Priests  left Diablo free to assume total
control over  the King's battered soul.  As the Lord of Terror attempted to strengthen his hold
upon the maddened King,  he found that  the lingering spirit of Leoric  fought with him  still.
Although  the control over Leoric that Diablo held  was formidable,  the Demon knew that in his
weakened state he could never take complete possession of his soul  as long as a glimmer of his
will remained. The demonlord sought a fresh and innocent host upon which to build his Terror.
     The demon relinquished his control over Leoric, but the King's soul was left corrupted and
his mind crazed.  Diablo began to search throughout Khanduras  for the perfect vessel to act as
his focus, and found such a soul easily within his reach. Enjoined by his dark master,  Lazarus
kidnapped  Albrecht - the only son of Leoric - and dragged  the terrified youth  down into  the
blackness  of the labyrinth.  Flooding the boy's defenseless mind  with  the  essence  of  pure
Terror, Diablo easily took possession of the young Albrecht.
     Pain and fire raced through the child's soul. Hideous laughter filled his head and clouded
his thoughts.  Paralyzed with fear,  Albrecht felt the presence of Diablo within his mind as it
seemed to push him down,  deeper and deeper into darkness and oblivion.  Diablo gazed  upon his
surroundings  through the eyes of the young prince.  A lustful hunger  still tortured the demon
after his frustrating bout  for control over Leoric,  but  the nightmares  of the boy  provided
ample substance  to sate him.  Reaching deep  into Albrecht's subconscious,  Diablo  ripped the
greatest fears of the child from their hiding places and gave them breath.
     Albrecht watched, as if out of a dream,  twisted and disfigured forms  appeared all around
him.  Unholy, writhing visages of terror danced about him chanting choruses of obscenities. All
of the  'monsters'  that he had ever imagined or believed  that he had seen in his life  became
flesh and were given life before him.  Large bodies  comprised of living rock  erupted from the
walls and bowed to their dark master. The ancient,  skeletal corpses of the Horadrim arose from
archaic crypts  and lumbered off  into the red washed  corridors beyond.  As the  cacophony  of
madness  and  nightmares  hammered its final blow against  Albrecht's scattered  and  scrambled
maniacally into the lengthening passageways of his waking Nightmare.
     The ancient catacombs  of the  Horadrim  had become  a twisted labyrinth  of raw,  focused
Terror.  Empowered by Diablo's possession  of young Albrecht,  the creatures  of the  boy's own
imagination  had gained  corporeal form. So strong was the terror that grew inside of Albrecht,
that the borders  of the Mortal realm  began to warp and tear.  The Burning Hell  began to seep
into the world of Man  and take root  within the labyrinth. Beings and occurrences displaced by
time and space,  and long lost  to the history of Man  were pulled s creaming  into  the  ever-
expanding domain.
     The body of Albrecht,  fully possessed by Diablo,  began to distort and change.  The small
boy grew and his eyes  blazed as tendril-like spines ripped  through his flesh.  Great,  arched
horns erupted from Albrecht's skull  as Diablo altered the form of a child to match that of his
demonic body.  Deep within the recesses of the labyrinth,  a growing power was being harnessed.
When the moment was right,  Diablo would venture once more  into the mortal world  and free his
captive Brothers Mephisto and Baal.  The Prime Evils would be reunited, and together they would
reclaim their rightful place in Hell.

THE FALL OF THE BLACK KING
     The war against the zealous armies of Westmarch ended with a horrible slaughter.  With the
army of  Khanduras  ripped to shreds  by  the  superior  numbers  and  defensive  positions  of
Westmarch,  Lachdanan  quickly  gathered  together  those  who  were not captured or killed and
ordered a retreat  back to the safety of Khanduras.  They returned to find the town of Tristram
in shambles.
     King Leoric, deep within the throes of madness,  went into a rage when he learned that his
son was missing.  After scouring the village  with the few guards that remained  within  at the
monastery, Leoric had decided that the townsfolk had abducted his son and hidden him somewhere.
Although the townsfolk denied  any knowledge of Prince Albrecht's whereabouts,  Leoric insisted
that  they had crafted  a conspiracy  against him,  and that they would pay the price  for such
treachery.
     The mysterious disappearance of the  Arch-Bishop Lazarus left no one in Tristram with whom
the King  would take council. Overcome by grief and dementia,  Leoric had many of the townsfolk
executed for the crime of high treason.
     As Lachdanan and his fellow survivors returned to confront their King, Leoric sent his few
remaining guards against them.  Believing that  Lachdanan  was  somehow part of the townsfolk's
conspiracy. Leoric decreed that he and his party were to die. Lachdanan, finally realizing that
Leoric was beyond salvation,  ordered his men to defend themselves.  The ensuing battle carried
them down  into the very halls of the darkened Monastery,  bringing  a final desecration to the
once holy sanctum of the Horadrim.  Lachdanan won a bittersweet victory  as his men were forced
to kill all of Leoric's  deceived protectors.  They cornered  the ravenous King  within his own
sanctuary  and begged him to explain the atrocities he had committed.  Leoric only spat at them
and cursed them for traitors against both his crown and the Light.
     Lachdanan walked slowly towards his King and sorrowfully drew his sword. Full of grief and
rage,  all honor  having been cast  to the winds,  Lachdanan  ran  his blade  through  Leoric's
shriveled,  blackened heart.  The once noble King  screamed an unearthly  death-cry, and as his
madness  finally overtook him,  he brought down  a curse upon those  who had  so  betrayed him.
Calling upon  the forces  of Darkness  that  he had  spent  his entire life  combating,  Leoric
condemned Lachdanan and the others to eternal damnation.  In that last,  fleeting moment within
the heart  of the Monastery,  all that was ever virtuous  or  honorable about  the  stewards of
Khanduras was shattered forever.

THE REIGN OF DIABLO
     The Black King  lay dead,  slain  at the hands  of his own  Priests and Knights. The young
Prince Albrecht  was still missing,  and  the proud defenders  of Khanduras  were no more.  The
people  of Tristram  looked about  their lifeless town  and  were  greatly dismayed.  Awash  in
feelings  of both relief and remorse,  they soon realize that  their troubles had merely begun.
Strange, eerie lights  appeared in the darkened windows of the Monastery.  Misshapen, leathery-
skinned creatures were seen venturing forth from the shadows of the church.  Horrible,  wounded
cries  seemed to linger  on the wind, emanating from deep underground.  It became apparent that
something quite unnatural had infested the once holy sight...
     Travelers on the roads surrounding Tristram were accosted by cloaked riders that seemed to
now constantly roam the deserted countryside. Many villagers fled Tristram, making their way to
other towns  or  kingdoms,  fearing some  unnamed evil  that seemed to wait in the shadows  all
around them.  Those few chose to remain seldom ventured out at night, and never tread foot upon
the grounds of the cursed Monastery.  Whispered rumors of poor,  innocent people being abducted
in the night by wicked,  nightmarish creatures filled the halls of the local inn. With no King,
no law, and no army left to defend them, many of the townsfolk began to fear an attack from the
things that now dwelt beneath their town.
     The Arch-Bishop Lazarus, frayed and disheveled,  returned from his absence and assured the
townsfolk that  he too  had been ravaged  by the  growing evil  of the  Monastery.  With  their
desperate need for reassurance clouding  their good judgement,  Lazarus whipped the townspeople
into a  frenzied mob.  Reminding them  that  Prince Albrecht  was  still  unaccounted  for,  he
persuaded many of the men to follow him into the depths of the Monastery to search for the boy.
They gathered torches  and soon the night air  glowed with  the flickering light of hope.  They
armed themselves  with shovels,  picks and  scythes and  so  prepared, they boldly followed the
treacherous Arch-Bishop straight into the fiery man of Hell itself...
     The few  who survived  the horrible fate  that  awaited  them  returned  to  Tristram  and
recounted what they could of the ordeal. Their wounds were terrible, and even the skills of the
healer  could not save  some of them.  As the stories of demons and devils spread,  a stifling,
primal Terror  began to consume the hearts of all the town's inhabitants.  It was a Terror that
none of them had ever known...
     Deep beneath the foundations of the ruined Monastery, Diablo gorged himself upon the fears
of the mortals above him.  He slowly  sank back into the welcoming shadows and began to harness
his depleted power.
     He smiled to himself  in the sheltering darkness,  for he knew that  the time of his final
victory was fast approaching...

===============================================================================================

SWORDS
The sword  is the epitome of the warrior's weapon.  Forged in fire and tempered to a fine edge,
a good blade can cut through armor or a demon's thick hide with equal case.  Some warrior clans
of Khanduras go so far as to forsake any other weapon  besides a sword,  and abandon the use of
a shield in favor of greatswords that stand the full height of a man.

AXES
Axes are favored  by those who are willing to sacrifice defense for power. In addition to being
slower  than other weapons,  even the smallest combat axe  requires two hands be free  to wield
properly,  precluding the use of a shield.  However, no other mundane item can match the damage
of a good axe. Legends speak of enchanted axes capable of slicing through flesh and steel as if
through butter.

MACES AND CLUBS
Sometimes the simplest tools are the best. Whether it be a stout piece of wood or a spiked mace
a good clubbing weapon can be deadly in the hands of a strong warrior.  The minions of Mephisto
-the undead- are said  to have  an especially difficult time  resisting  the effects  of broken
bones and shattered limbs.

STAVES
The art of staff fighting  has never  gained  much acceptance  in Khanduras,  but long ago  the
Brotherhood of Vizjerei discovered ways to use a simple wooden staff as a container for focused
magical energy.  The process  of creating  a spell staff  is very time consuming,  but  even an
apprentice Vizjerei  can recharge a stafff  by channeling magical energy into it.  Spell staves
may be used  to cast spells  that the wielder  does not yet know,  and that  do no require  the
expenditure of mana. The staff must be wielded in order to use the spell it contains.
Oddly enough, the act of infusing a staff with sorceries seems to grant the staff a will of its
own. Only those skilled in the arts of magic can hope to control very powerful spell staves. It
is also possible to find staves that have been further enchanted to make them more effective in
combat or to grant other abilities to the wielder.

BOWS
Bows are excellent weapons for those who to prefer to strike at their foes from a distance. The
greatest archers in the world are the Sisters of the Sightless Eye. They are trained in the use
of every instrument of archery,  from the short bows used by the Horsemen of the Kataan Steppes
to the great war bows of the Northern Tribes.  Even  the most skilled of the Sisters,  however,
knows that a bow is no match for a sword or other weapon if the fighting should come to close
quarters.

LIGHT ARMOR
Light armor ranges from simple clothing,  such as robes and cloaks,  to hardened leather armor.
Even tossed aside rags will provide some protection. Although armor of this type offers minimal
protection from most attacks, it is very lightweight and inexpensive to repair.

MEDIUM ARMOR
This category includes basic metal armor,  such as chainmail and ring mail.  In general, armors
of this type  provide good protection  from physical attacks,  but  are heavy enough  that only
athletic characters can wear them comfortably.

HEAVY ARMOR
Most  heavy armor  consists of solid metal plates  over a chain mesh.  The extent  of the plate
coverage  determines the exact type of armor.  Field plate, for instance, covers only the torso
and arms  with solid plates  to provide  maximum mobility.  Only the strongest heroes  can wear
heavy armor,and it is very expensive to repair. Plate armor does provide the highest protection
possible  from  physical  attacks,  and  enchanted  plate  armor  can  make  a  warrior  nearly
unstoppable.

HELMETS
Even a simple leather cap  can spell  the difference  between life and death,  and it is a good
idea  to use  the best helmet that you can afford.  Many members of the Horadrim wore crowns of
unearthly metals  to reflect  their status,  and often these crowns were enchanted for superior
protection.

SHIELDS
Shields are extremely popular  as both a means of defense  and decoration.  Your character will
automatically  attempt to block  any  incoming blows  with his or her shield,  and in times  of
desperation  it can even be used  as a bashing weapon. Bows, axes, staves, and other two-handed
weapons cannot be used in conjunction with a shield.

POTIONS
One form of magic  that is still strong in the West  is the brewing of elixirs  that can have a
variety  of beneficial effect s on the imbiber.  By far  the most common of these draughts  are
healing potions,  which can instantly mend torn flesh  and knit broken bone back together. Mana
potions  are infused  with raw magical energy  to restore  the abilities of spell casters  that
have expended  their power.  The old church  is sure  to have a strong supply  of both types of
potions,  as the clergy used them to care for the sick and wounded. Locals skilled in herbcraft
may also be able  to supply your character with potions,  for the right price.  It's known that
the greatest of the Horadrim alchemists  created strange concoctions  that permanently affected
the drinker.

SCROLLS
By carefully preparing special parchment with magical inks,  a focus for spells can be created.
Such magical scrolls provide the reader with the ability to cast a spell that they normally may
not know,  without expending any mana.  Very powerful spells  cannot be used  by the untrained,
however,  for the cryptic symbols upon them are difficult to comprehend. The act of casting the
spell  drains the scroll  of all  magical power  and  causes the parchment  to crumble  to dust
instantly.

BOOKS
More valuable than gold to any sorcerer,  books may contain clues to quests, spell formulas, or
other pieces of knowledge.  The time of the Horadrim  is considered to be  the greatest age  of
magic,  when untold discoveries in the arcane arts were made. These powerful mystics used every
ounce of power  at their command  to preserve humanity.  Although  the Eastern mage-clans  keep
watch over vast libraries of magical tomes, it is suspected that a great part of this knowledge
was lost  when the last of the Horadrim died.  There may be  lost works beneath the church that
could bring some of these ancient magics to light...

GOLD
During the long reign of peace  that existed in Khanduras  most towns and cities  agreed upon a
standard gold coin  to use in trade.  The Church of Zakarum  has tried to have its own currency
accepted as the new standard,  but so far  it has gained little acceptance.  Although  it would
seem that  the minions of the Three would have no use for gold coins, many demons hoard all the
wealth that they can find.

===============================================================================================

===============================================================================================

FIREBOLT
The true essence  of Fire  lies at the edge  of Energy and Matter.  It is  therefore,  a fairly
simple matter  to shape Mana  into a magical flame. Controlling a bolt of this fire as it flies
towards  its target  is another matter  entirely.  As experience and knowledge  with this spell
grows,  both  the intensity of the flame  and the speed of the bolt  can be increased  with the
caster feeling less exertion.

INFERNO
Inferno sacrifices the mobility of a Firebolt  for pure damaging power.  Rather than attempting
to control the path and cohesiveness of a single bolt, the caster conjures forth an individual,
focused  stream of flame.  Although it dissipates  beyond more than a few paces, with a greater
understanding of the forces  at work the stream of fire  can not only be extended a significant
amount,  but also  can be maintained  for a few moments more.  The heat  of an Inferno  is more
intense than that of a Firebolt as more Mana is being converted into essential energy.

WALL OF FIRE
Magical fire feeds upon no earthly souce,  being fueled instead by the mystic energies known as
Mana. While the heat of conjured flames may cause normal matter to combust and burn on its own,
the flames themselves  will burn as long they have Mana to draw upon.  By carefully controlling
the flow of Mana  to a magical fire,  its  life-span  can be  extended  well  beyond  that of a
Firebolt  or an  Inferno. T he Horadrim were skilled enough to create torches that burn with an
eternal flame,  but those abilities  have been long lost. With this spell, the caster creates a
wall of eldritch flame  that will burn  until the Mana in that area  has been exhausted. As the
knowledge  of this spell  increases,  the rate  at which  Mana must be  consumed  can be better
controlled and the Wall of Fire can be made to burn longer.

CHARGED BOLT
The true essence of Electromagnetism  exists on the threshold  of the Ethereal and the Physical
Realms.  While it is very efficient  to transform Mana into electrical energy,  it is extremely
difficult to control.  This spell calls into being  multiple pockets of lightning which seem to
have  a will of their own.  The caster  is able to  shield  himself  from  the effects of these
charges,  but any creature - friend or foe - may be struck. Greater understanding of this spell
allows more of these Charged Bolts to be formed,  and their existence will be  maintained for a
longer period of time.  The physical toll on the caster,  however, increases as well, requiring
more Mana to be spent.

LIGHTNING
The caster of this spell seeks to control  the discharge of electrical energy by focusing it in
single stream of lightning.  The effects  of channeling this powerful force  of nature  onto an
unprotected creature  are awesome indeed.  With  experience,  these  bolts of lightning  may be
maintained for a longer period ot time while requiring less Mana to be used.

FLASH
The Flash spell  was created  to fight the servants of Baal,  whose minions  prefer to surround
their enemies and attack from all sides silmutaneously. To properly form most incantations, the
caster  must be able  to concentrate long enough  to complete  the  necessary  invocations  and
gestures.  With this spell, the caster draws in as much Mana as possible as quickly as possible
from the surrounding area  and concentrates it into single point within his own body. This Mana
is then released  in a single burst of  raw energy  that  dissipates  very  rapidly - and  very
violently.  While this spell  is usable only in close combat,  it is extremely potent  and will
strike creatures on all sides of the caster.

HOLY BOLT
While the Horadrim were the greatest mortal spell casters ever known,  not all of the followers
of the Light  were as proficient in magic  as they were.  During  the quest  to  bind Mephisto,
common soldiers  were hard pressed  to combat  the seemingly endless tides  of the undead  that
guarded  the First Brother.  During this time,  Cathan,  a devout priest  who was also a fierce
warrior,  found that by invoking the powers of the High Heavens and then infusing them with the
essence of Fire,  a bolt of  great speed  and  intensity  could be created  and  used  by those
otherwise  untrained in the use of magic.  This Holy Bolt  harms only the undead, making it far
safer to use while on a chaotic battlefield.

HEALING
The art of self healing is an invaluable ability, and it is for this reason that this spell has
been preserved  throughout  the ages.  When cast,  Mana courses  through  the  body,  instantly
knitting broken bone, replacing torn tissue and reducing the effects of shock and fatigue. With
time,  this spell can be developed to the point that it can instantly restore even those on the
brink of death.  The ability to heal others is much rarer, and those that can do so are greatly
respected.

RESURRECT
During the assault  upon Mephisto's Fortress of Bone,  the army led by the Horadrim  was nearly
overwhelmed  by the legions of the damned. As soon as one of the crusaders was slain in combat,
his body  would rise again  as an undead warrior to fight against his former companions. On the
eve  of what was  to be  the final attack  upon  the  Fortress, a  mysterious  figure  in white
appeared  before the Council of the Horadrim.  This apparition  revealed to them  the secret of
piercing  the barrier between Life and Death. By Resurrecting te slain soldiers,  they could be
saved  from eternal corruption.  Those present at the Council  swore an oath  never to use this
ability  once the battle was over,  but somehow the secret escaped. This spell has the power to
bring  a dead soul  back to the physical world,  but  it must be performed  at the site  of the
person's death.

IDENTIFY
Any object  imbued with magic  exhibits an aura that is easily noticed.  To determine the exact
nature  of this enchantment,  however,  requires intense study  and  an extensive  knowledge of
arcane materials and symbols.  While none have mastered the ability to memorize a spell of this
magnitude,  the Vizjerei have developed a means for the untrained to discover the secrets of an
ensorcelled object  by using a rare crystal  that is extremely sensitive to magical auras. This
sensitivity  makes it  very fragile,  however and the crystal will shatter if it is brought too
close  to an enchanted item.  The very act  of identifying  such  an object  also  destroys the
crystal.  Scroll and staves  have been crafted  that can be used to identify magical auras.  By
using  special inks and dyes  that contain tiny grains of these crystals,  the stability of the
crystal is maintained until it is used to examine the enchanted object.

TOWN PORTAL
The Horadrim constructed  numerous magical gateways  between the mighty fortresses so that they
could  quickly  concentrate  their  defenses  against any incursion  by the Demons.  With but a
thought,  the Crusaders of the Light  could transport themselves  to predetermined destinations
many leagues apart.  Although  the secret of  creating these gateways has been long lost, it is
still possible  to use the pathways that are already in place. A Portal opened by means of this
spell  will always  take the caster  to the location  of the nearest gate  and remain open long
enough  to bring the caster  back to his point of origin.  The Church of Tristram is built upon
the remains of a Horadrim monastery, and it is quite probable that a gateway lies nearby.

TELEKINESIS
This versatile spell  is derived  from a training exercise that was used by the Horadrim.  Once
they reached a certain point in their training,  acolytes were bound and locked in a cell, with
the key to the door lying on the floor in front of them. The student had to unlock and open the
door without being able to physically move. Through intense concentration and fine control, the
acolyte could manipulate the key as if it was hel by an invisible hand. Those that were able to
open  the cell door  were  allowed  to proceed  to the next level of training.  There  is  some
speculation  as to the fate  of those unfortunates  that lacked  the magical prowess to escape.
Today,  this spell  serves are a reminder  that what was once a simple mental exercise  for the
Horadrim  is now a difficult spell known by few sorcerers.  Telekinesis could prove very useful
in the labyrinth, as there are many trapped doors and chests that could be safely opened from a
distance.  By exerting greater force,  at a cost in fine control,  creatures can also be pushed
away from the caster.

===============================================================================================

The Minion of Darkness fall into three categories, and are divided according to their masters.

MEPHISTO, the Lord of Hatred (Odium)
The legions of Mephisto  are driven by a hatred of all living things - especially those who are
pure of heart.  He counts as minions both the walking dead, who forever seek vengeance upon the
living,  as well as a host of demonically corrupted creatures whose twisted limbs and misshapen
bodies leave them in eternal agony and rage.
 SKELETONS (Ossium Animatum)
    These are  the skeletal remains  of warriors  who  either  died  as soldiers  in  some dark
    campaign,  or  were betrayed  by those they most trusted. Now animated by unnatural forces,
    these troops  of the Damned  forever seek new recruits to join their ranks. If our greatest
    fears  do prove to be true,  the skeletal warriors  that are  rumored  to haunt the town of
    Tristram  might well be the corrupted remains of the valiant Horadrim monks laid to rest in
    the catacombs  beneath the church.  Only an incredibly potent evil could have disturbed the
    peaceful slumber of these eremites.
    Skeletons  are usually found  in places where the dead are laid to rest  or at the sites of
    great battles.  While physically fragile,  they are neverlacking in numbers, for those that
    fall to them in combat  are damned  to an eternal lust for living blood. Coupled with their
    unthinking rage, this makes them a dangerous opponent.
 ZOMBIES (Cibus Animatus)
    Worm-ridden and reeking of foul decay,  Zombies are formed from the corpses of men executed
    for comitting the most depraved and degenerate crimes against the innocent. They are driven
    by both the hatred that consumed them in life and an insatiable hunger for the flesh of the
    living.
    Tenacious and possessing stamina  of  infernal origin,  Zombies  and their ilk  make  for a
    difficult encounter.  Fortunately,  these  undead minions  are  lacking  in both  will  and
    mobility which can be used to great affect against them.
 OVERLORDS (Tyrannus Pinguis)
    Even the Seraphim  are not immune  to the corruption  of the Dark Lords.  One  such angels,
    Inarius,  was proud of his beauty  and boasted loudly of his purity and worth. His thoughts
    became so clouded  that he believed  himself  to be above both Angel and Demon, and he left
    the High Heavens  to form his own dominion.  He constructed  a great cathedral  of mirrored
    glass and crystal,  and followers  flocked to him,  drawn by his numinous charm and wealth.
    Once Inarius had gathered a sizable army, he decided to prove his power.
    Inarius first laid siege to an infernal temple devoted to the worship of Mephisto, but made
    the foolish mistake  of overestimating his prowess. The armies of Inarius laid waste to the
    temple  and killed the dark monks that  dwelled within.  The Three Evils had considered the
    vain warrior  a mere nuisance  and amusement  until this time,  but this was an insult that
    they could not bear.
    Mephisto himself is said to have appeared at the cathedral of Inarius. He laid waste to the
    church  and the surrounding countryside.  The Lord of Hatred  took the proud archangel  and
    his followers  captive.  He bound Inarius  with tremendous chains and slowly tore the wings
    from  the back of the angel.  Great  barbed hooks  were then  used  to stretch out the once
    glowing skin  and his features  were distorted  by vile powers.  Many  of the followers  of
    Inarius  were given  as gifts to Baal and Diablo,  but  the rest  were molded  to match the
    bloated image of the now crippled angel. To this day, Inarius is said to be trapped in Hell
    within  a chamber of mirrors,  his eyelids torn from his face  as he is forced to gaze upon
    his misshapen form for all eternity. His misguided followers now serve as Hell's taskmaster
    taking the anguish of their lost glory out upon the bodies of others.
    These grotesque demons  have considerable brawn hidden beneath their layers of greasy flab.
    Do not underestimate their strength  or their intelligence for crossing swords with them is
    ill advised. You will be far better served to combat them with ranged weapons or magic.
 MAGMA DEMONS (Dominus Ardor)
    During the Great Conflict  tremendous battles  were fought in both the High Heavens and the
    Burning Hells.  Both sides  often  carried the conflict  deep  within  the realms  of their
    enemies.  During  one epic battle  into the very heart of Mephisto's fiery lair, a group of
    brave Seraphim warriors fronted an assault against the Lord of Hatred himself. One of these
    angelic soldiers  made a bold attack and struck a fierce blow that caused the foul blood of
    Mephisto  to rain  upon the ground.  Each drop  that fell  seared through the crust of Hell
    itself and formed powerful demons shaped from molten rock. These demons quickly rose to the
    aid of their master, and drove back the forces of Light by striking them with thrown masses
    of lava that seared both flesh and bone with the intensity of the Burning Hells. The losses
    dealt by these Magma Demons were tremendous.

BAAL, the Lord of Destruction (Excidium)
The soldiers of Baal  seek the undoing of the universe.  They strive  for ultimate disorder and
destruction,  and to this end  covet the destruction of all they behold. Order is an abhorrence
to them and these creatures are the manifestation of the forces of chaos.
 FALLEN ONES (Nanus Improbus)
    Swarms  of these impish terrors  have been  known  to come out the night  and  tear apart a
    sleeping village  in minutes.  Small of stature  and  simian in appearance, these creatures
    possess  surprising strength  and unnatural agility. Other than killing, the only act which
    gives them pleasure is breeding, so expect to encounter them in large packs.
    The small size of these devils does fill them with cowardice, however, and this fear can be
    used  against them.  They prefer to attack under the guise of darkness and in large numbers
    whenever possible.  If  they are shown  great strength,  preferably by killing one of their
    kind,  they will  retreat  and  regroup.  Do not turn your back on them,  though, for their
    appetite  for destruction  will eventually overcome their caution  and they will attempt to
    strike again.
 GOAT MEN (Aries Vehemens)
    The lieutenants of Baal  are  bred  for  strength,  endurance,  and cunning.  These  demons
    constantly  train themselves  in the art of war, for battle is their bread and the blood of
    innocents, their water. There are several known "clans" of Goat Men, each given a different
    gift  from  their Dark Master. It is believed that to earn their powers they once held mock
    wars  in Hell  for the entertainment  of the Three Brothers.  Do not  expect  them to fight
    amongst themselves  on  the mortal realm,  however,  for  they much prefer to slaughter the
    innocent.
    Like most of Baal's spawn, the bestial Aries are incredibly strong and agile. Be especially
    wary  of their archers,  for they are renowned  for the accuracy  and  power of their Great
    Bows.  Fleet of foot,  they may try to evade an unwary foe and then attack from a different
    angle.
 SPITTING TERRORS (Bestia Acerbus)
    After an especially violent battle, Baal enjoyed celebrating with his Brothers by holding a
    disgusting  feast of blood, human flesh, and other Hellish delights. The Bestis Acerbus are
    the descendants  of doglike creatures  that lived  by  feeding  upon  the remains of Baal's
    nightmarish feasts.  The variety of vile substances that the creatures consumed, along with
    their close proximility to the Lord of Destruction, twisted and warped the viscera of these
    Hounds of Hell. This diabolic species is capable of spitting up a variety of caustic fluids
    and  projecting  them  at  considerable  distance.  Packs  of these terrors  are especially
    devastating,  as their bile has been known to eat through the strongest of armor and poison
    the most hearty men.
    Great care  must be taken  when  within the lair of these Bestia.  Their venom  retains its
    potency  for a considerable amount of time  and puddles of it may be found everywhere. When
    killed,  the beast's inner toxins  eat through the now-dead flesh, leaving a dangerous trap
    for those foolish enough to tread upon the corpse.
 HORNED DEMONS (Impetum Cornuta)
    Used  as living siege engines,  there are  numerous accounts  of these juggernauts smashing
    into the lines of the Seraphim and leaving only death and ruin in their wake. The skull and
    the single large horn  in the snout  of the demon are unnaturally durable. The Horned Demon
    prefer to wait until a clear path is available  and then  they charge towards their victims
    at incredible speeds.  Be wary of this initial charge!  It is far better to deal with these
    creatures in close quarters or with magic.

DIABLO, the Lord of Terror (Metus)
Using illusion  and fear  as their greatest weapons,  the attendants  to Diablo  are formidable
adversaries. They prefer to wait for their opponent to display a moment of weakness before they
attack.  Equally dangerous  in the dark or in your dreams, they are the fears of man made flesh
by Diablo's will. These nightmaries lurk at the edges of mortal perception from the moment that
you take your first breath - and they long to be with you when you take your last.
 WINGED FIENDS (Alae Nefastus)
    Some people are so hungry for power and knowledge  that they are willing to sacrifice their
    humanity  to the Lords of Hell in exchange for gifts that inevitably turn against them. One
    such group,  a dark cabal of wizards,  decided to take the power of creation into their own
    hands  and magically created a race of creatures  to act as servants and messengers.  Using
    infernal abilities  granted to them through their arcane pact, they formed small bat-winged
    imps that they believed would prove useful  in carrying out deeds that were too trivial for
    their own efforts.  Each of the sorcerers  created an entity  that  reflected  his  magical
    specialization.  The creatures thus created  were small,  nimble and possessed an unnatural
    cunning.
    At first the corrupt sorcerers were overjoyed at the success of their experiment,  but they
    soon began to notice that  the Alae did not serve them  as loyalty  as they had hoped.  The
    creatures  had taken to secretly  feeding from the very essence of their masters, weakening
    them  and eventually killing them.  The sorcerers tried to destroy their creations, but the
    fiends banded together to combat them. The winged fiends has been secretly breeding outside
    of the sorcerer's domains,  and swarms of them attacked,  killing their former masters.  To
    this day, the descendants of these creations terrorize the countryside.
    Do not underestimate  this foul demons.  They are physically weak,  but posses great speed.
    Many of them  possess unearthly abilities reflecting  the powers of their creators and they
    also enjoy  using their razor sharp claws and hooked wings to tear the flesh from the faces
    of their victims.
 SCAVENGERS (Maleficus Vorax)
    Maleficus Vorax  are the smallest  of a related group  of demonic creatures  that feed upon
    carrion, mostly the remains of victims killed by their large cousins. Unlike most scavenger
    however,  they are  extremely aggressive  and  will not hesitate  to attack  anyone hapless
    enough to encounter them. They have powerful legs which they use to swift springing attacks
    striking  at vulnerable  faces and throats.  Their  primary  weakness  is  their  voracious
    appetite;  the smell of death  may drive them  into a feeding frenzy  where  they will stop
    their attacks to feast upon remains that are nearby.
 THE HIDDEN (Metus Occultus)
    The Hidden  are the bogeymen  that haunt our dreams and live in the nightmares of children.
    Although  they dwell  at the edge  of the Physical  and  Ethereal Realms  where they remain
    unseen  by mortal sight, they can quickly manifest and strike those that appear vulnerable.
    Metus Occultus and others of their ilk feed on the essence of fear. When wounded, they will
    seek  to retreat back  into the Ether to heal themselves. It is important to note that even
    while invisible the creature exists partially on the Physical Realm, and can be affected by
    spells and weapons.
 GARGOYLE (Signum Vitiosum)
    In ages past, it was customary to decorate buildings with stone statues of demons that were
    enchanted  to serve  as guardians  and protectors of those within. The misshapen figures of
    the statues  were designed  to taunt and anger  any demons that attempted to gain entrance.
    Diablo worked to unlock the wards  that protected these granites images, and eventually was
    able  to gift them  with a Hadean life.  The Gargoyle  arose  from  their captive sleep and
    swooped down to prey upon those whom they were created to protect. Naturally, the remaining
    statues  were  immediately destoyed,  but  there are Signum  that  escaped  and continue to
    terrorize the innocent to this day.
    The act of transforming from flesh to stone  allows the creature to heal any wounds that it
    has suffered,  so it is best  to either avoid  these demons entirely  or  to hunt them down
    until they are dead. Do not allow them to flee, for they will soon return in full force.

15.  G O S S I P  A R O U N D  T R I S T R A M
===============================================================================================

GRISWOLD THE BLACKSMITH
01. Sometimes  I think that Cain  talks too much, but I guess that is his calling in life. If I
    could bend steel  as well as  he can bend your ear, I could make a suit of court plate good
    enough for an emperor!
02. A good man  who puts  the needs  of others  above  his own.  You won't find  anyone left in
    Tristram - or anywhere else for that matter - who has a bad thing to say about the healer.
03. While I have to prectically smuggle in the metals and tools I need from caravans that skirt
    the edges of our damned town, that witch, Adria, always seems to get whatever she needs. If
    I knew  even  the smallest bit  about how to harness magic  as she did,  I could make  some
    trully incredible things.
04. The inkeeper  has little business  and  no real way of turning a profit. He manages to make
    ends meet  by providing food  and  lodging  for those  who  occasionally  drift through the
    village,  but they are  a likely to sneak off  into the night as they are to pay him. If it
    weren't  for the stores of grains  and  dried meats  he kept in his cellar, why, most of us
    would have  starved  during  that first year  when  the entire countryside  was  overrun by
    demons.
05. Gillian is a nice lass.  Shame that her gammer is in such poor health or I would arrange to
    get both of them out of here on one of the trading caravans.
06. I was with Farnham  that night that Lazarus  led us  into  the labyrinth.  I  never saw the
    Archbishop again,  and  I may not have survived  if Farnham was not at my side. I fear that
    the attack  left his soul  as crippled as,  well,  another  did my leg. I cannot fight this
    battle for him now, but I would if I could.
07. That lad  is going to get himself  into serious trouble... or  I guess I should say, again.
    I've tried  to interest him  in working here  and  learning about  an honest trade,  but he
    prefers the high profits of dealing in goods of dubious origin.  I cannot hold that against
    him after what happened to him, but I do wish he would at least be careful.
08. The axe?  Aye, that's a good weapon, balanced against any foe. Look how it cleaves the air,
    and then imagine a nice fat demon head in its path.  Keep in mind, however, that it is slow
    to swing - but talk about dealing a heavy blow!
09. Your weapons  and  armor will show the signs of your struggles against the darkness. If you
    bring them  to me,  with a bit of work  and a hot forge, I can restore them to top fighting
    form.
10. If you're looking for a good weapon, let me show this to you. Take your basic blunt weapon,
    such as  mace.  Works  like a charm  against  most of those undying horors  down there, and
    there's nothing better to shatter skinny little skeletons!
11. Look at that edge,  that balance. A sword in the right hands, and against the right foe, is
    the master of all weapons. Its keen blade finds little to hack or pierce on the undead, but
    against a living, breathin enemy, a sword will better slice their flesh!

CAIN THE ELDER
01. Griswold - a man of great action and great courage.  I bet he never told you about the time
    he went into the labyrinth to save Wirt, did he?  He knows his fair share of the dangers to
    be found there,  but then again - so do you. He is a skilled craftsman, and if he claims to
    be able to help you in any way, you can count on his honesty and his skill.
02. Ah,  Pepin.  I count him  as a  true friend - perhaps  the closest I have here. He is a bit
    addled at times, but never a more caring or considerate soul has existed. His knowledge and
    skills are equaled by few, and his door is always open.
03. The witch,  Adria,  is an anomaly here in Tristram. She arrived shortly after the cathedral
    was desecrated while most everyone else was fleeing. She had a small hut constructed at the
    edge of town, seemingly overnight,  and has access to many strange and arcane artifacts and
    tomes of knowledge that even I have never seen before.
04. Odgen  has owned  and  run  the rising sun inn  and  tavern  for  almost four years now. He
    purchased it  just a few short months  before everything here went to hell. He and his wife
    Garda  do not have the money  to leave as they invested all  they had  in making a life for
    themselves here. He is a good man with a deep sense of responsibility.
05. Gillian is a fine woman.  Much afored for her high spirits and her quick laugh, she holds a
    special place in my heart.  She stays on at the tavern  to support  her elderly grandmother
    who is too sick to travel. I sometimes fear for her safety,  but I know that any man in the
    village would rather die than see her harmed.
06. Poor Farnham.  He is  a disqueting reminder  of the doomed assembly  that  entered into the
    cathedral with Lazarus on that dark day. He escaped with his life, but his courage and much
    of his sanity  were left  in some dark pit.  He  finds comfort  only  at the bottom  of his
    tankard  nowadays,  but  there are  occasional bits  of truth  buries  within  his constant
    ramblings.
07. The story of Wirt is a frightening and tragic one. He was taken from the arms of his mother
    and dragged into the labyrinth  by the small,  foul demons that wield  wicked spears. There
    were many other children taken that day,  including  the son of King Leoric. The knights of
    the palace went below, but never returned. The blacksmith found the boy, but only after the
    foul beasts had begun to torture him for their sadistic pleasures.
08. I know of many myths and legends  that may contain answers  to questions  that may arise in
    your journeys into the labyrinth.  If you come across challenges and questions to which you
    seek knowledge, seek me out and I will tell you what I can.
09. While you are venturing  deeper into the labyrinth  you  may find  tomes of great knowledge
    hidden there. Read them carefully for they can tell you things that even I cannot.

PEPIN THE HEALER
01. Griswold  knows  as much about the art of war  as  I do  about the art of healing.  He is a
    shrewd merchant,  but his work  is second to none. Oh, I suppose that may because he is the
    only blacksmith left here.
02. Cain  is a true friend  and  a wise sage.  He  maintains  a vast library  and has an innate
    ability  to discern the true nature of many things.  If you ever have  any questions, he is
    the person to go to.
03. While  I  use  some  limited forms of magic to create the potions and elixirs I store here,
    Adria  is a  true sorceress.  She  never seems to sleep,  and she always has access to many
    mystic tomes  and  artifacts. I believed her hut may be much more than the hovel it appears
    to be, but I can never seem to get inside the place.
04. I really  don't understand  why Odgen  stays  here  in Tristram.  He suffers  from a slight
    nervous condition,  but  he is  an intelligent  and  industrious man who would do very well
    wherever  he went. I suppose  it may be  the fear of the many murders  that  happen  in the
    surrounding countryside,  or perhaps  the wishes  of his wife  that keep him and his family
    where they are.
05. Odgen's barmaid is a sweet girl.  Her grandmother is quite ill, and suffers from delusions.
    She claims that they are visions, but I have no proof of that one way or the other.
06. Even  my skills  have been  unable  to fully heal Farnham. Oh, I have been able to mend his
    body, but his mind and spirit are beyond anything I can do.
07. Poor Wirt.  I did all that was possible  for the child,  but I know he despises that wooden
    peg  that  I  was forced  to attach  to his leg.  His  wounds  were hideous.  No  one - and
    especially such a young child - should have to suffer the way he did.
08. Before it was taken over by, well, whatever lurks below, the cathedral was a place of great
    learning.  There are  many books  to be found there.  If you find any, you should read them
    all, for some may hold secrets to the workings of the labyrinth.
09. I have made  a very interesting  discovery.  Unlike us,  the creatures in the labyrinth can
    heal themselves without the aid of potions or magic.  If you hurt one of the monsters, make
    sure it is dead or it very well may regenerate itself.

ADRIA THE WITCH
01. To a man who only knows iron, there is no greater magic than steel. The blacksmith Griswold
    is more  of a sorcerer  than he knows.  His ability  to meld fire and metal is unequaled in
    this land.
02. A chest  opened in darknss  holds  no greater treasure than when it is opened in the light.
    The storyteller Cain is an enigma, but only to those who do not look. His knowledge of what
    lies beneath the cathedral is far greater than even he allows himself to realize.
03. The hand, the heart and the mind can preform miracles when they are in perfect harmony. The
    healer Pepin sees into the body in a way even I cannot. His ability to restore the sick and
    injured is magnified by his understanding of the creation of elixirs and potions.  He is as
    great an ally as you have in Tristram.
04. Earthen walls and thatched canopy  do not a home create. The innkeeper Odgen serves more of
    a purpose  in this town  than many understand.  He  provides  shelter  for  Gillian and her
    matriarch,  maintains what life Farnham has left to him, and provides an anchor for all who
    are left  in the town  to what Tristram once was. His tavern, and the simple pleasures that
    can still be found there,  provide a glimpse of a life that the people here remember. It is
    that memory that continues to feed their hopes for your success.
05. Corruption  has the strength  of deceit,  but inocence holds the power of purity. The young
    woman Gillian has a pure heart,  placing the needs of her matriarch over her own. She fears
    me, but it is only because she does not understand me.
06. The higher  you place your faith  in one man,  the farther it has to fall. Farnham has lost
    his soul,  but not to any demon. It was lost when he saw his fellow townspeople betrayed by
    the Archbishop Lazarus.  He has knowledge  to be gleaned,  but  you must separate fact from
    fantasy.
07. There is much about the future we cannot see, but when it comes it will be the children who
    wield it. The boy Wirt has a blackness upon his soul, but he poses no threat to the town or
    its people.  His secretive dealings  with the urchins  and  unspoken guilds of nearby towns
    gain him access to many devices  that cannot be easily found in Tristram. While his methods
    may be  reproachful,  Wirt  can provide assistance  for your battle against the encroaching
    darkness.
08. The sum of our knowledge is in the sum of its people. Should you find a book or scroll that
    you cannot  decipher,  do not hesitate  to bring it to me. If I can make sense of it I will
    share what I find.
09. The greatest power is often the shortest lived. You may find ancient words of power written
    upon  scrolls of parchment.  The strength  of these scrolls  lies  in the ability to either
    apprentice or adept to cast them with equal ability. Their weakness is that whey must first
    be read aloud and can never be kept at the ready of your mind. Know also that these scrolls
    can be read but once, so use them with care.

ODGEN THE TAVERN OWNER
01. Griswold the blacksmith  is  extremely knowledgeable  about  weapons and armor. If you ever
    need work done on your gear, he is definitely the man to see.
02. If you want to know more about the history of our village, the storyteller Cain knows quite
    a bit about the past.
03. Pepin  is a good man - and certainly  the  most  generous  in  the village.  He  is  always
    attending  to the needs of others,  but trouble of some sort or another does seem to follow
    him wherever he goes...
04. Adria is wise  beyond  her years,  but I must admit - she frightens me  a little.  Well, no
    matter. If you ever have need to trade in items of sorcery, she maintains a strangely well-
    stocked hut just across the river.
05. Gillian,  my barmaid? If it were not for her sense of duty to her grand-dam, she would have
    fled  from here  long ago.  Goodness knows  I begged her to leave, telling her that I would
    watch after the old woman, but she is too sweet and caring to have done so.
06. Farnham spends far too much time here, drowning his sorrows in cheap ale.  I would make him
    leave, but he did suffer so during his time in the labyrinth.
07. Wirt is rapscallion and a little scoundrel. He was always getting into trouble, and it's no
    surprise  what happened to him.  He probably went fooling about someplace that he shouldn't
    have been. I feel sorry for the boy, but I don't abide the company that he keeps.
08. Many adventurers  have graced  the tables  of my tavern, and ten times as many stories have
    been told over as much ale.  The only thing that I ever heard any of them agree on was this
    old axiom. Perhaps it will help you. You can cut the flesh, but you must crush the bone.

GILLIAN THE BARMAID
01. Our blacksmith  is a point of pride  to the people  of Tristram.  Not only  is he  a master
    craftsman who has won many contests within his guild, but he received praises from our King
    Leoric himself - may his soul rest in peace. Griswold is also a great hero; just ask Cain.
02. Cain has been the storyteller of Tristram  for as long as I can remember. He knows so much,
    and can tell you just about anything about almost everything.
03. Pepin  saved  my grandmother's life,  and  I know that  I can never repay him for that. His
    ability to heal any sickness is more powerful  than the mightiest sword and more mysterious
    than any spell you can name. If you ever are in need of healing, Pepin can help you.
04. The woman  at the edge of town  is a witch!  She seems nice enough, and her name, Adria, is
    very pleasing  to the ear,  but I am very afraid of her. It would take someone quite brave,
    like you, to see what she is doing out there.
05. Odgen and his wife  have  taken me and my grandmother  into their home and have even let me
    earn  a few gold pieces  by working at the inn.  I owe so much to them, and hope one day to
    leave this place and help them start a grand hotel in the east.
06. 

07. I grew up  with Wirt's mother,  Canace.  Although  she was only  slightly hurt  when  those
    hideous creatures stole him,  she never recovered. I think she died of a broken heart. Wirt
    has become  a mean-spirited youngster,  looking only  to profit from the sweat of others. I
    know that  he suffered  and  has seen horrors  that I cannot even imagine, but some of that
    darkness hangs over him still.
08. My grandmother  had a dream  that you would come  and talk to me. She has visions, you know
    and can see into the future.

FARNHAM THE DRUNK
01. Griswold?  Good old Griswold. I love him like a brother! We fought together, you know, back
    when... we... Lazarus... Lazarus... Lazarus!!!
02. 

03. Hehehe, I like Pepin.  He really tries, you know. Listen here, you should make sure you get
    to know him. Good fella like that with people always wantin' help.  Hey, I guess that would
    be kinda like you, huh hero? I was a hero too...
04. Why don't that old crone  do somethin'  for a change.  Sure, sure, she's got stuff, but you
    listen to me... she's unnatural.  I ain't never seen her eat or drink - and you can't trust
    somebody who desn't drink at least a little.
05. Odgen  is the best man  in town.  I don't think his wife  likes me much, but as long as she
    keeps tappin' kegs,  I'll like her  just fine.  Seems like  I been spendin'  more time with
    Odgen than most, but he's so good to me...
06. The gal who brings the drinks? Oh, yeah, what a pretty lady. So nice, too.
07. Wirt  is a kid  with more problems  than even me,  and  I know  all  about problems. Listen
    here - that kid is gotta sweet deal,  but he's been there, you know? Lost a leg! Gotta walk
    around on a piece of wood. So sad, so sad...
08. No one ever lis... listens to me.  Somewhere - I  ain't too sure - but  somewhere under the
    church  is a shole pile o' gold.  Gleamin' and shinin'  and just waitin' for someone to get
    it.
09. I wanna tell ya sumthin',  'cause I know all about this stuff. It's my specialty. This here
    is the best... Theeeee best! That other ale ain't no good since those stupid dogs...
10. If I was you... and I ain't... but if I was, I'd sell all that stuff you got and get out of
    here. That boy out there... he's always got somethin good, but you gotta give him some gold
    or he won't even show you what he's got.

WIRT THE PEG-LEGGED BOY
01. I guess  I owe the blacksmith  my life - what there is of it.  Sure, Griswold offered me an
    apprenticeship at the smithy, and he is a nice enough guy,  but I'll never get enough money
    to... well, let's just say that I have definite plans that require a large amount of gold.
02. Cain knows too much.  He scares the life  out of me - even more than  that woman across the
    river.  He keeps telling me about  how lucky I am to be alive, and how my story is foretold
    in legend. I think he's off his crock.
03. As long as  you  don't need anything reattached,  old Pepin is as good as they come. If I'd
    have had some of those potions he brews, I might still have my leg...
04. Adria  truly  bothers me.  Sure, Cain is creepy in what he can tell you about the past, but
    that witch can see into your past.  She always has some way to get whatever she needs, too.
    Adria  gets her hands  on more morchandise  than  I've seen pass  through the gates  of the
    king's bazaar during high festival.
05. Odgen is a fool  for staying here. I could get him out of town for a very reasonable price,
    but he insists  on trying to make a go of it with  that stupid tavern.  I guess at least he
    gives Gillian a place to work, and his wife garda does make a superb shepherd's pie...
06. If I were a few years older,  I would shower her  with whatever riches  I could muster, and
    let me assure you  I can get my hands on some very nice stuff.  Gillian is a beautiful girl
    who should get out of Tristram  as soon as it is safe.  Hmmm... maybe I'll take her with me
    when I go...
07. Don't trust everything the drunk says.  Too many ales  have fogged  his vision and his good
    sense.
08. In case  you haven't  noticed,  I don't  buy anything  from Tristram.  I am  an importer of
    quality goods.  If you want  to peddle junk,  you'll have to see  Griswold,  Pepin  or that
    witch, Adria. I'm sure that they will snap up whatever you can bring them...

===============================================================================================

THE BUTCHER
Griswold : I saw what Farnham calls the Butcher  as it swathed a path  through the bodies of my
           friends.  He swung a cleaver as large as an axe, hewing limbs and cutting down brave
           men  where they stood.  I was separated  from the fray by a host of small screeching
           demons  and somehow found the stairway leading out.  I never saw  that hideous beast
           again, but his blood-stained visage haunts me to this day.
Cain     : It seems that the Archbishop Lazarus goaded many of the townsmen into venturing into
           the labyrinth to find the king's missing som. He played upon their fears and whipped
           them  into a frenzied mob.  None of them  were prepared for what lay within the cold
           earth... Lazarus  abandoned them  down there - left  in the clutches  of unspeakable
           horrors - to die.
Pepin    : By the light, I know of this vile demon.  There were many that bore the scars of his
           wrath upon their bodies  when the few survivors of the charge led by Lazarus crawled
           from  the cathedral.  I don't know  what  he used  to slice open his victims, but it
           could not have been of this world.  It left wounds festering with disease and even I
           found them almost impossible to treat. Beware if you plan to battle this fiend...
Adria    : The Butcher  is a sadistic creature that delights in the torture and pain of others.
           You have seen his handiwork in the drunkard Farnham. His destruction will do much to
           ensure the safety of this village.
Odgen    : Yes,  Farnham  has  mumbled  something  about  a hulking brute  who wielded a fierce
           weapon. I believe he called him a butcher.
Gillian  : When Farnham said something about a Butcher killing people, I immediately discounted
           it. But since you brought it up, maybe it is true.
Farnham  : Big!  Big cleaver  killing  all my friends.  Couldn't  stop  him,  had to  run away,
           couldn't  save  them.  Trapped  in a room  with so many bodies... so many friends...
           noooooooooo!
Wirt     : I know more than you'd think about that grisly fiend.  His little friends got a hold
           of me and managed to get my leg before Griswold pulled me out of that hole. I'll put
           it bluntly - kill him before he kills you and adds your corpse to his collection.

POISONED WATER SUPPLY
Griswold : Pepin has told you the truth. We will need fresh water badly, and soon. I have tried
           to  clear  one of  the smaller wells,  but  it reeks  of stagnant filth.  It must be
           getting clogged at the source.
Cain     : Hmm,  I don't know  what  I can really tell you about this that will be of any help.
           The water that fills our wells  comes from an underground spring.  I have heard of a
           tunnel  that  leads  to  a  great  lake  -  perhaps  they  are  one  and  the  same.
           Unfortunately, I do not know what would cause our water supply to be tainted.
Pepin    : Please,  you must hurry.  Every hour that passes brings us closer to having no water
           to drink. We cannot survive for long witout your help.
Adria    : The people of Tristram  will die  if you cannot restore  fresh water to their wells.
           Know this - demons are at the heart of this matter, but they remain ignorant of what
           they have spawned.
Odgen    : I have always tried  to keep a large supply  of foodstuffs  and drink in our storage
           cellar,  but with the entire town  having no source of fresh water,  even our stores
           will soon run dry. Please, do what you can or I don't know what we will do.
Gillian  : My grandmother is very weak,  and Garda says that we cannot drink the water from the
           wells. Please, can you do something to help us?
Farnham  : You drink water?
Wirt     : For once, I'm with you.  My business runs dry - so to speak - if I have no market to
           sell to. You better find out what is going on, and soon!

THE CURSE OF KING LEORIC
Griswold : I made many of the weapons and most of the armor that King Leoric used to outfit his
           knights.  I even  crafted  a huge two-handed sword of the finest mithril for him, as
           well as a field crown to match. I still cannot believe how he died, but it must have
           been some sinister force that drove him insane!
Cain     : Ahh,  the story  of our king,  is it?  The tragic fall of Leoric was a harsh blow to
           this land.  The people  always  loved the king,  and now they live in mortal fear of
           him.  The question that I keep asking myself is how he could have fallen so far from
           the light,  as Leoric had always been the holiest of men.  Only the vilest powers of
           hell could so utterly destroy a man from within...
Pepin    : The loss  of his son  was too much  for King Leoric.  I did what I could to ease his
           madness, but  in the end  it overcame him.  A black curse has hung over this kingdom
           from that day  forward,  but perhaps if you were to free his spirit from his earthly
           prison, the curse would be lifted...
Adria    : The dead  who walk  among the living  follow the cursed king.  He holds the power to
           raise  yet more warriors  for an ever growing army of the undead. If you do not stop
           his reign, he will surely march across this land and slay all who still live here.
Odgen    : As I told you,  good master,  the king  was entombed  three levels below.  He's down
           there, waiting in the putrid darkness for his chance to destroy this land...
Gillian  : I don't like to think about  how the king died.  I like to remember him for the kind
           and just ruler that he was. His death was so sad and seemed very wrong, somehow.
Farnham  : I don't care  about that.  Listen,  no skeleton is gonna be my king. Leoric is king.
           King, so you hear me? Hail to the king!
Wirt     : Look,  I'm running a business here. I don't sell information, and I don't care about
           some king that's been dead longer than I've been alive. If you need something to use
           against this king of the undead, then I can help you out...

ODGEN'S SIGN
Griswold : Demons stole Odgen's sign, you say? That doesn't sound much like the atrocities I've
           heard of - or seen.  Demons  are  concerned  with  ripping out your heart,  not your
           signpost.
Cain     : I see that  this  strange behaviour  puzzler you as well. I would surmise that since
           many demons fear the light of the sun  and believe that it holds great power, it may
           be that  the rising sun  depicted  on the sign you speak of  has led them to believe
           that  it too  holds some arcane powers. Hmm, perhaps they are not all as smart as we
           had feared...
Pepin    : My goodness,  demons running about the village  at night,  pillaging  our homes - is
           nothing sacred? I hope that Odgen and Garda are all right. I suppose that they would
           come to see me if they were hurt...
Adria    : No mortal  can  truly  understand  the  mind of the demon.  Never let  their erratic
           actions confuse you, as that too may be their plan.
Odgen    : Master,  I have  a strange  experience  to  relate.  I  know  that  you have a great
           knowledge  of those monstrasities  that inhabit the labyrinth, and this is something
           that I cannot understand  for the very life of me... I was awakened during the night
           by a scraping sound just outside of my tavern.  When I looked out from my bedroom, I
           saw  the shapes of small demon-like creatures  in  the inn yard. After a short time,
           they  ran off,  but not before  stealing the sign to my inn.  I  don't know  why the
           demons would steal my sign but leave my family in peace... 'tis strange,no?
Gillian  : Oh my!  Is that  where  the sign went?  My grandmother  and  I must have slept right
           through the whole thing. Thank the light that those monsters didn't attack the inn.
Farnham  : You know  what I think?  Somebody took that sign,  and they gonna want lots of money
           for it.  If I was Odgen... and I'm not, but if I was... I'd just buy a new sign with
           some pretty drawing on it. Maybe a nice mug of ale or a piece of cheese...
Wirt     : What - is he saying  I took that? I suppose that Griswold is on his side, too. Look,
           I got over simple sign stealing  month ago.  You can't turn a profit  on a piece  of
           wood.

THE MAGIC ROCK
Griswold : I am still waiting  for you  to bring me  that stone from the Heavens. I know that I
           can make something powerful out of it.
Cain     : Griswold speaks of the Heaven stone that was destined for the enclave located in the
           east.  It was being taken there  for further study. This stone glowed with an energy
           that  somehow granted vision  beyond that which a normal man could possess. I do not
           know what secrets it holds,  my friend, but finding this stone would certainly prove
           most valuable.
Pepin    : I don't know  what it is that they thought they could see with that rock, but I will
           say this. If rocks are falling from the sky, you had better be careful!
Adria    : The heaven stone is very powerful, and were it any but Griswold who bid you fint it,
           I would  prevent it.  He will harness its powers and its use will be for the good of
           us all.
Odgen    : The caravan  stopped here  to take on some supplies for their journey to the east. I
           sold them quite an array  of fresh fruits  and some excellent sweetbreads that Garda
           has just finished baking. Shame what happened to them...
Gillian  : Well,  a caravan of some very important people  did stop here,  but that was quite a
           while ago.  They  had strange accents  and  were starting  on a  long journey,  as I
           recall.  I  don't see  how  you could hope  to find anything  that  they  would have
           carrying.
Farnham  : I used to have  a nice ring;  it was a really expensive one, with blue and green and
           red  and  silver.  Don't remember  what happened to it,  though.  I really miss that
           ring...
Wirt     : If anyone  can make something out  of that rock,  Griswold can.  He knows what he is
           doing,  and as much as  I try to steal  his customers,  I respect the quality of his
           work.

VALOR
Griswold : The armor known as Valor could be what tips the scale in your favor. I will tell you
           that many have looked for it - including myself. Arkaine hid it well, my friend, and
           it will take  more  than  a bit of luck  to unlock  the secrets  that  have  kept it
           concealed oh, lo these many years.
Cain     : The gateway of blood  and the halls of fire are landmarks of mystic origin. Wherever
           this book you read  from resides  it is surely a place of great power. Legends speak
           of a pedestal  that is carved  from obsidian stone  and  has a pool of boiling blood
           atop  its bone encrusted surface.  There are also  allusions to stones of blood that
           will open  a door  that guards an ancient treasure... The nature of this treasure is
           shrouded  in speculation,  my friend,  but it is said that  the ancient hero Arkaine
           placed the holy armor Valor  in a secret vault. Arkaine was the first mortal to turn
           the tide of the Sin War and chase the legions of darkness back to the burning hells.
           Just before  Arkaine died,  his armor was hidden away  in a secret vault. It is said
           that when this holy armor is again needed, a hero will arise to don valor once more.
           Perhaps you are that hero...
Pepin    : Hmm... it sounds like  something  I  should remember, but I've been so busy learning
           new cures and creating better elixirs that I must have forgotten. Sorry...
Adria    : Should you find these  stones of blood,  use them carefully. The way is fraught with
           danger and your only hope rests within your self trust.
Odgen    : Every child  hears  the story of the warrior Arkaine  and  his mystic armor known as
           Valor.  If you could find its resting place, you would be well protected against the
           evil in the labyrinth.
Gillian  : The story of the magic armor  called Valor  is something I often heard the boys talk
           about. You had better ask one of the men in the village.
Farnham  : Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...
Wirt     : You intend  to find  the armor  known as Valor?  No one  has  ever figured out where
           Arkaine  stashed  the stuff,  and if my contacts couldn't find it, I seriously doubt
           you ever will either.

THE CHAMBER OF BONE
Griswold : I know nothing  of this place,  but  you may try  asking Cain.  He talks  about many
           things, and it would not surprise me if he had some answers to your question.
Cain     : A book that speaks of a chamber of human bones? Well, a chamber of bone is mentioned
           in certain archaic writings that I studied in the libraries of the east. These tomes
           inferred  that  when the lords of the underworld desired to protect great treasures,
           they would create domains where those who died in the attempt to steal that treasure
           would be forever bound to defend it. A twisted, but strangely fitting, end?
Pepin    : This sounds  like a very dangerous place.  If  you venture there,  please take great
           care.
Adria    : You will become  an eternal servant  of the dark lords should you perish within this
           cursed domain. Enter the Chamber of Bone at your own peril.
Odgen    : I am afraid that  I don't know anything about that, good master. Cain has many books
           that may be of some help.
Gillian  : I am afraid that  I haven't heard anything about that.  Perhaps Cain the storyteller
           could be of some help.
Farnham  : Okay,  so listen.  There's  the chamber of wood, see. And his wife, you know - her -
           tells  the tree...  cause you gotta wait.  Then I says, that might work against him,
           but if you think I'm gonna pay for this... you... uh... yeah.
Wirt     : A vast and mysterious treasure, you say? Maybe I could be interested in picking up a
           few things  from you...  or better yet,  don't  you need  some  rare  and  expensive
           supplies to get you through this ordeal?

HALLS OF THE BLIND
Griswold : I am afraid that  I have neither  heard  nor  seen  a place  that matches your vivid
           description, my friend. Perhaps Cain the storyteller could be of some help.
Cain     : You recite  an interesting rhyme  written in a style that reminds me of other works.
           Let me think  now - what was it?  Darkness shrouds  the hidden.  Eyes glowing unseen
           with only the sounds of razor claws briefly scraping to torment those poor souls who
           have been made  sightless  for all eternity. The prison for those so damned is named
           the Halls of the Blind...
Pepin    : This  does seem familiar, somehow. I seem to recall reading something very much like
           that poem  while researching the history of demonic afflictions. It spoke of a place
           of great evil that... wait - you're not going there are you?
Adria    : This is a place of great anguish  and  terror,  and so serves its master well. Tread
           carefully or you may yourself be staying much longer than you had anticipated.
Odgen    : I never much cared  for poetry. Occasionally, I had cause to hire minstrels when the
           inn was doing well,  but that seems like  such a long time ago now. What? Oh, yes...
           uh, well, I suppose you could see what someone else knows.
Gillian  : If you have questions about blindness, you should talk to Pepin. I know that he gave
           my grandmother a potion that helped clear her vision, so maybe he can help you, too.
Farnham  : Look here... that's pretty funny, huh? Get it? Blind - look here?
Wirt     : Lets see, am I selling you something? No.  Are you giving me money to tell you about
           this? No.  Are you now leaving  and going to talk  to the storyteller  who lives for
           this kind of thing? Yes.

BLACK MUSHROOM
Griswold : If Adria  doesn't  have one of these,  you can bet that's a rare thing indeed. I can
           offer you no more help than that, but it sounds like... a huge, gargantuan, swollen,
           bloated mushroom! Well, good hunting, I suppose.
Cain     : The witch Adria seeks a black mushroom? I know as much about black mushrooms as I do
           about  red herrings.  Perhaps  Pepin the healer  could  tell you  more,  but this is
           something that cannot be found in any of my stories or books.
Pepin    : Thw witch  told me  that you were searching for the brain of a demon to assist me in
           creating my elixir. It should be of great value to the many who are injured by those
           foul beasts,  if I can just unlock  the secrets I suspect that its alchemy holds. If
           you can remove  the brain of a demon  when  you kill it,  I would be grateful if you
           could bring it to me.
Adria    : It's a big,  black mushroom that I need. Now run off and get it for me so that I can
           use it for a special concoction that I am working on.
Odgen    : Let me just say this.  Both  Garda and I  would never, ever serve black mushrooms to
           our honored guests.  If Adria  wants some mushrooms  in her stew,  then  that is her
           business, but I can't help you find any. Black mushrooms... disgusting!
Gillian  : I think Odgen  might have  some mushrooms  in the storage cellar.  Why don't you ask
           him?
Farnham  : Odgen mixes a mean black mushroom, but I get sick if I drink that. Listen, listen...
           here's the secret - moderation is the key!
Wirt     : I don't have any mushrooms of any size or color  for sale. How about something a bit
           more useful?

ANVIL OF FURY
Griswold : Nothing yet, eh?  Well, keep searching. A weapon forged upon the anvil could be your
           best hope, and I am sure that I can make you one of the legendary proportions.
Cain     : Griswold  speaks  of the Anvil of Fury - a legendary artifact long searched for, but
           never found.  Crafted  from the metallic bones of the razor pit demons, the Anvil of
           Fury  was smelt around the skulls  of the five most powerful magi of the underworld.
           Carved  with runes of power and chaos,  any weapon  or armor forged  upon this anvil
           will be  immersed  into the realm of chaos, imbedding it with magical properties. It
           is said that  the unpredictable nature of chaos  makes it difficult to know what the
           outcome of this smithing will be...
Pepin    : If  you  had been looking  for information  on  the pestle of curing  or  the silver
           chalice of purification,  I  could  have  assisted you, my friend.  However, in this
           matter, you would be better served to speak to either Griswold or Cain.
Adria    : There  are  many  aftifacts  within  the  labyrinth  that  hold  powers  beyond  the
           comprehension  of mortals.  Some of these  hold  fantastic power that can be used by
           either  the light  or  the darkness.  Securing the anvil from below  could shift the
           course of the Sin War towards the light.
Odgen    : Don't you think that Griswold would be a better person to ask about this? He's quite
           handy, you know.
Gillian  : Griswold's father  used to tell  some of use  when we were growing up  about a giant
           anvil  that was used  to make mighty weapons.  He said that when a hammer was struck
           upon this anvil, the ground would shake with a great fury. Whenever the earth moves,
           I always remember that story.
Farnham  : Griswold can't sell his anvil. What will he do then? And I'd be angry too if someone
           took my anvil!
Wirt     : If you were to find this artifact for Griswold,  it could put a serious damper on my
           business here. Awwww, you'll never find it.

WARLORD OF BLOOD
Griswold : Dark and wicked legends  surrounds  the one Warlord of Blood.  Be well prepared,  my
           friend, for he shows no mercy or quarter.
Cain     : I know of only one legend that speaks of such a warrior  as you describe.  His story
           is found within the ancient chronicles of the Sin War... Stained by a thousand years
           of war, blood and death, the Warlord of Blood stands upon a mountain of his tattered
           victims.  His dark blade  screams a black curse to the living; a tortured invitation
           to any  who whould stand  before  this executioner of hell.  It is also written that
           although he was once a mortal  who fought beside the legion of darkness  during  the
           Sin War, he lost his humanity to his insatiable hunger for blood.
Pepin    : Cain would be able to tell you much more about something like this than I would ever
           wish to know.
Adria    : His prowess  with the blade  is  awesome,  and  he has lived  for thousands of years
           knowing only warfare. I am sorry... I can not see if you will defeat him.
Odgen    : I am afraid that I haven't heard anything about such a vicious warrior, good master.
           I hope that you do not have to fight him, for he sounds extremely dangerous.
Gillian  : If you are  to battle  such  a fierce opponent,  may  light  be your guide  and your
           defender. I will keep you on my thoughts.
Farnham  : Always you gotta talk about blood? What about flowers, and sunshine, and that pretty
           girl that brings the drinks. Listen here, friend - you're obsessive, you know that?
Wirt     : I haven't ever dealt  with this warlord you speak of,  but he sounds like he's going
           through a lot of swords. Wouldn't mind supplying his armies...

LACHDANAN
Griswold : If it is actually Lachdanan that you have met, then I would advise that you aid him.
           I dealt with him  on several occasions  and  found him  to be  honest  and  loyal in
           nature.  The curse that fell upon the followers of King Leoric would fall especially
           hard upon him.
Cain     : You  claim  to have spoken  with Lachdanan?  He was  a great hero  during  his life.
           Lachdanan  was an honorable  and  just man who served his king faithfully for years.
           But of course,  you already know that.  Of those who were caught within the grasp of
           the king's curse,  Lachdanan  would be  the least likely  to submit  to the darkness
           without a fight,  so  I suppose that  your story  could  be true.  If I were in your
           place, my friend, I would find a way to release him from his torture.
Pepin    : A golden elixir, you say. I have never concocted a potion of that color before, so I
           can't tell you  how  it would effect you  if  you were to try  to drink it.  As your
           healer,  I strongly advise that should you find such an elixir, do as Lachdanan asks
           and do not try to use it.
Adria    : You may meet people who are trapped within the labyrinth, such as Lachdanan. I sense
           in him honor and great guilt. Aid him, and you aid all of Tristram.
Odgen    : You speak  of a brave warrior  long dead!  I'll have  no such talk  of speaking with
           departed souls in my inn yard, thank you very much.
Gillian  : I've never heard of a Lachdanan before.  I'm sorry,  but I don't think that I can be
           of much help to you.
Farnham  : Lachdanan is dead.  Everybody knows that,  and you can't  fool me  into thinking any
           other way. You can't talk to the dead. I know!
Wirt     : Wait, let me guess. Cain was swallowed up  in a gigantic fissure that opened beneath
           him.  He was incinerated  in a ball of hellfire,  and  can't answer  your  questions
           anymore.  Oh,  that isn't what happened?  Then I guess you'll be buying something or
           you'll be on your way.

ARCHBISHOP LAZARUS
Griswold : I was there  when Lazarus  led us into the labyrinth.  He spoke of holy retribution,
           but  when we started fighting  those hellspawn,  he did not so much as lift his mace
           against them. He just ran deper into the dim, endless chambers that were filled with
           the servants of darkness!
Cain     : You must hurry  and  rescue Albrecht  from the hands  of Lazarus. The prince and the
           people of this kingdom are counting on you!
Pepin    : I was shocked when I heard of what the townspeople were planning to do that night. I
           thought that  of all people,  Lazarus would have had more sense than that. He was an
           archbishop, and always seemed to care so much for the townsfolk of Tristram. So many
           were injured, I could not save them all...
Adria    : I did not know  this Lazarus  of whom you speak,  but  I do  sense  a great comflict
           within his being.  He poses  a great danger,  and will stop at nothing  to serve the
           powers of darkness which have claimed him as theirs.
Odgen    : Lazarus was the archbishop  who led many of the townspeople  into  the labyrinth.  I
           lost many good friends that day, and Lazarus never returned. I suppose he was killed
           along  with most of the others.  If you would do me a favor, good master - please do
           not talk to Farnham about that day.
Gillian  : I remember Lazarus  as being a very kind  and  giving man.  He spoke at  my mother's
           funeral,  and was supportive of my grandmother and myself in a very troubled time. I
           pray every night that somehow, he is still alive and safe.
Farnham  : They stab,  then bite,  then they're  all around you.  Liar! Liar! They're all dead!
           Dead! Do you hear me? They just keep falling and falling... their blood spilling out
           all over the floor... all his fault...
Wirt     : Yes,  the righteous Lazarus,  who was  sooo  effective  against  those monsters down
           there.  Didn't help save my leg, did it? Look, I'll give you a free piece of advice.
           Ask Farnham, he was there.

DIABLO
Griswold : -
Cain     : Your story is  quite grim,  my friend.  Lazarus  will  surely  burn in hell  for his
           horrific  deed.  The boy  that you describe  is not our prince,  but  I believe that
           Albrecht may yet  be in danger.  The symbol of power that you speak must be a portal
           in the very heart  of the labyrinth.  Know this,  my friend - the evil that you move
           against  is the dark Lord of Terror. He is known to mortal men  as Diablo. It was he
           who was imprisoned within the labyrinth  many centuries ago and I fear that he seeks
           to once again sow chaos in the realm of mankind. You must venture through the portal
           and destroy Diablo before it is too late!

1.  If  you  have  a  magic item or unique item that decrease your spell levels by 1 or 2 don't
    sell  it  or  throw  it  away  because it's a very useful item (specially for the warrior).
    Here's  the  trick, when you wear those item your spell levels will decrease by one and the
    magic  requirement also decrease,  so you can level up your spell, then  put-off that item.
    Your spell level will increase.
    Example,  you  have  a  Charged Bolt on Level 2. If you want to read a Charged Bolt Book it
    requires 36 magic. Put on that item and your Charged Bolt Level will decrease 1. So now you
    have  a  Charged  Bolt  Level 1 and if you want to read the book it only requires 30 magic.
    Read the book, and your  level will increase 1. Put off that item and your Charged Bolt now
    on Level 3.

2.  The best way to kill a skeleton is using a 'Holy Bolt' spell.

3.  Every level-up, your character will gained 5 level-up points. Distribute it wisely, because
    it will help your character through the 16 levels of Diablo. And remember that you can't
    buy an Elixir of Vitality.

4.  Don't  forget  to repair your item, because when their durability reach zero, the item will
    disappear.

5.  Pepin the Healer will give you a free healing every time you visit him.

6.  You  can  only  cast  one  Golem  at  a  time. If you cast another Golem, both of them will
    destroyed.

7.  In Gharbad Quest, you will receive an item.  If you don't like that item,  do this trick to
    get another item.  First  take the first item he give you.  Then load your game.  With this
    trick you can get many various item.  If you have patience,  do this a lot and sometimes he
    will give you a unique item.

8.  When you get a level up, go to your inventory and pick up an item, then put it back down.
    Your damage will increase by one every time you get a level and do that.

===============================================================================================

I remove all the names  inside my List of the Damned  except the first two. From
now on I will focused this Damned List only for those damn plagiarist.

1. Name    : VEGA
   E-mail  : vdirect@bdg.centrin.net.id
   Website : http://www.vegindo.com
   He plagiarized my Dino Crisis walkthrough and sell it in his store.He sold it
   for Rp. 12.500,-.  Although  he has translate my walkthrough  into Indonesian
   language,  I can still recognize it.  That stupid son of a ***** translate it
   words-by-words.  The book's title  is  GAME GUIDE Volume 9.  All the previous
   volume  of that book  is  also  ripping  someone else's faq  (especially from
   GameFAQs) and translate it into Indonesian.
   For HS,  the animal that I suspect responsible for that,  I got few words for
   you :
   F*** YOU BASTARD.  HOW DARE YOU PLAGIARIZE MY WALKTHROUGH AND SOLD IT IN YOUR
   FILTHY STORE.  ENJOY THAT MONEY WHILE YOU CAN.  BECAUSE SOON  I WILL MAKE YOU
   REGRET FOR BEING BORN INTO THIS WORLD.
   For any of the reader that want to do me any favor, please send flames, hate
   mail, viruses, bomb, nuclear, or anything to his address.

2. Name    : Game Station
   E-mail  : gameguys@bdg.centrin.net.id
   Website : http://www.vegindo.com/gamestation
   Address : Jl. Pungkur 155 Lt. 2, Bandung 40251.
   He plagiarized my friend's walkthrough (also from GameFAQs),  so I think that
   this animal is worthy enough to enter my Damned List. They publish it in Game
   Station, October 1999, 3rd week, volume 21, Rp. 3.500,-
   For KSH,  Sir Maul,  Tik Tan, Ratu Bedak, Blue Beo, and anybody that I forgot
   to mention, I just want to say this : SCREW YOU ALL!!!!! Someday I will visit
   your office carrying a BIG Shotgun, ready for blowing your f***ing brains out
   from your f***ing head.
   Reader, please send this a**hole some 'nice' stuff.

3. Name   : X-Boy a.k.a Pansy-Boy a.k.a X-Gay
   E-mail : x-boy@gundam.com
   This son of a *****  is the webmaster of that ****ing site (www.vegindo.com).
   He's  the world's  dumbest son of a *****  that  I  have  ever met.  In their
   ****ing  messageboard,  it  says  that  we (faq author)  are  the same as the
   plagiarist, cause all we do is just finished the game and then write it down.
   Ha ha ha ha ha ha, what a good reason.  Now you know why I said that he's the
   world's dumbest son of a *****.
   If you said that we just finished the game  and then write it down, why don't
   you do that by yourself, mother****er?!?!?! Why you have to ripp my faqs?!?!

For Pansy-Boy, Miss Maul, and the rest of your ****ing crew :

DIN PAPPA R EN GRIS KNULLARE, S KAN KNULLADE DIN MAMMA OCH HON FDDE DIG!

Dein Vater ist ein Schweineficker, darum hat er deine Mutter gefickt und ich in

Tu padre es un follador de cerdos, por eso follo a tu madre y hizo possible

jigoku eiku no wa.. omaega saki da. te vas a ir al infierno antes que yo pendejo

Bapaklu tukang ngawinin babi, maka ia kawin sama babi terus tuh babi
ngelahirin elu. Dasar anak babi.

My last note for Damned #1, #2, and Damned #3
   All of you  will surely  burn in hell  for what you did,  so enjoy that blood
   money while you can....

Hey,  faq-makers, you should read this section.  I just  receive an e-mail and he  told me that
he has asking everybody  who made a walkthrough (including myself) and  I'm the  ONLY  one that
answered.  Have you all forgot the manner that your father and mother  taught you when you were
kids?  If someone asking for your help  and  you can help him,  then do so.  If  you don't want
people to send you an e-mail then said so  on your faq.  Don't let people disappointed.  I also
have the same experience.  I asked someone  and  he didn't answered me.  I don't know if he's a
busy man or not,  but he didn't answered me. I'm very disappointed.  Just because you have made
a great faq,  and a lot of people e-mail you,  it don't make you a great man.  What makes you a
great man is your attitude.

And for myself, I guarantee that  I will answer  your questions, even if I can't answer it. And
if  I haven't  answered your mail  within a week ,  please  mail me back, because maybe I don't
read your faq, or something like that.
