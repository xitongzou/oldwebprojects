<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 1: Super Majin Buu and 
Gotenks Fight with Great Power </font> </span></u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Ok, the summary prior to this would be, Buu is running amuck down on Earth, and 
now, he feels a great power in this tower. He goes up to see, but everyone won't 
let him. After some persuasion, they let him. Goten and Trunks are in the Room 
of Spirit and Time. Now, Goten and Trunks have fused to become Gotenks, and, are 
waiting for Buu to come in. Buu steps in, to find one warrior, for a most 
intense, and weird battle. Gotenks starts to power up, and becomes super Saiyan 
3 Gotenks. Buu is really amazed at this strong fighter, and the fight begins. 
Punches fly, kicks connect, ki blast everywhere, but no one is getting hurt. It 
also seems Piccolo has himself in the room as well. After 30 minutes, Gotenks 
turns into Goten and Trunks. Buu suddenly realizes, this great power has been 
shot down. He no longer has a challenge and doesn't want to be there. He makes a 
mini-portal to get out, and, before Piccolo and Goten and Trunks can get 
through, they get locked in. Waiting another 30 minutes, Goten and Trunks fuse, 
and, make a portal of their own to get out. After getting out, they see that 
everyone has been affected by Buu's onslaught on them. </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 2: Now Gohan Tries His 
Luck Against Buu </font> </span></u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Gohan just went through about a day's worth of doing a huge power up. He is no 
longer Gohan. He is now mystical Gohan. His power is nothing compared to others. 
He is even stronger that a super Saiyan 3 Gotenks. So of course, he would win. 
Wrong. While Gohan was fighting Buu, Gotenks was looking for Buu, but, when the 
finally found him, they de-fused and became Goten and Trunks. So, Gohan put up a 
good fight for 30 minutes, but then, Goten and Trunks fused, and, tried to fight 
Buu. But, a part of Buu's body was taken off by Gohan, and, used as a person 
absorber type thing. Gotenks was tricked, and, sucked into Buu. Buu now had, Fat 
Buu, Gotenks, and Piccolo in him. Gohan was over powered by Buu, and, couldn't 
take it. He couldn't take it. Luckily, his father was coming to save him.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 3: Goku's Complete 
Power is Ready to Fight the Evil Force </font> </span></u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Just as Gohan was about to be killed, Goku comes to the rescue. He throws a 
Kienzan at Buu, cutting him in half. But, Buu regenerates, and comes whole 
again. However, when Goku cut some of Buu off, he cut off the absorbent part 
that can absorb people into Buu. Goku had come to fuse with Gohan forever with 
the Potarra earrings. Gohan agreed, but, before Goku could give him the earring, 
the absorbent part of Buu came and absorbed up Gohan. Gohan, Piccolo, Fat Buu, 
Goten, and Trunks were now in Buu. </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 4: A Powerful Fighter 
is Born, Veggeto </font> </span></u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Now, the only people to fuse with were Mr. Satan and Dende. If Goku did try and 
fuse with Mr. Satan, his power wouldn't go up, but most likely, go way down, to 
about 1,000. Just as all hope seemed gone, a certain someone should his ugly mug 
again. Vegeta had come back from the dead. Goku pleaded that Vegeta would fuse 
with him with the Potarra earrings to defeat Buu. Vegeta refused, of course. 
After some persuasion, Vegeta agreed. Buu, on the other hand, gladly wanted 
Vegeta to fuse so he could have a fight. The two exchanged earrings, and, the 
powerful fighter and Veggeto was born. As soon as Veggeto became who he was, he 
became very cocky, and, proud of his powers. Left and right, Buu was getting 
whipped, with every different kind of attack. Buu couldn't take it, and started 
to power up, as did Veggeto. Veggeto really couldn't stay in super Saiyan. He 
was too powerful. Instead, he went up to super Saiyan 2. After shooting through 
Buu, the absorbent part of him came after Veggeto. Veggeto willingly went into 
Buu, so he could save his friends and family. </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 5: Everyone Has Escaped 
from Buu </font> </span></u><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
As soon as Veggeto came into Buu, something happened. Goku and Vegeta spilt up 
again. After doing so, they went to search for their family and friends. 
Searching and searching, they finally found them. They released them, and, Buu 
could feel his power slipping. Soon, his pores opened up, and, they could all 
escape. After escaping, Buu gradually became smaller and smaller. He soon became 
very animal-like. After finally transforming, he had the body of a 10-year-old 
child, but the mind of a killer. His power became more of any transformation he 
under went. His first attack, with the wave of his hand, created a massive 
energy ball, killing over half the world. Goku had no choice, but to fight, and 
try and stop him from destroying the world. </font> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0in"><u>
<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 6: A Big and Powerful 
Super Fight!! </font> </span></u><span style="font-family: Arial">
<font size="2">
<br>
After a short fight, Buu created an even massive energy ball that, actually did 
blow up the Earth. Goku transported everyone that was still alive to Kaio shin 
Kai, a planet for the gods. Buu, upon seeing the Shunkanidou, copied it, and, 
went to Kaio shin Kai. A great fight ensued. Goku, doing all he could, powered 
up to super Saiyan 3, and, fought Buu with all the power he had. This fight 
ended quickly, because Goku had run out of power. Fat Buu stepped in, and tried 
to fight Kid Buu. This fight ended quickly, because Fat Buu was way weaker than 
Kid Buu. In fact, everyone was weaker than Kid Buu. However, Goku had a plan.

<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Act 7: This is Your Chance 
Goku, Kill Buu with the Ultimate Genki Dama!!</font></span></u><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2"><br>
Goku, thinking of plan, came up with a great one. He decided to try and kill Buu 
with the Genki Dama. However, he didn't have enough energy, because Earth had 
been destroyed. So, he brought Dende to Namek and told them to find all the 
Dragon Balls. After doing so, he would give them orders on their wishes. He told 
them to revive the Earth, and everyone good on it. When done so, the Earth came 
back, all the good people came back, and, Vegeta came back to life. This meant, 
he had truly become good. So, Goku told the Earth to give him energy, to defeat 
Buu, by raising their hands. Everyone thought it was Babidi and a trick. Vegeta 
then tried, but they said Babidi was faking his voice. Mr. Satan, being the fake 
hero he was, tried his luck. Soon enough, everyone had done so. Every person 
raised his or her hands on Earth, and the Genki Dama was building. However, it 
wasn't enough. Vegeta pleaded for Goku to hurry, since he was trying to kill Buu. 
Goku then called on Namek to raise their hands. Then, the Yardatto's raised 
theirs. Soon, the Genki Dama was building to a great size. As soon as Vegeta 
couldn't take a beating anymore, Goku threw the bomb. The bomb over took Buu, 
but couldn't be pushed over him. Buu was pushing back. Goku tried his best to 
completely over take Buu, but to no avail. The next wish was made, for Goku's 
power to come back. After this wish was done, Goku turned super Saiyan. With 
this power, he could easily kill Buu. The Genki Dama over powered Buu, and, 
killed him.</font></span>
