<p><b><font face="Arial" color="#2F69A8" size="4">S</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial">aiya-jins
are an extraordinary, barbarous and powerful race. (Note: In Japanese, &quot;jin&quot;
means people; so that means that saiya-jin are &quot;Saiya people&quot;) Their
sole purpose in life was to fight and survive. At the beginning of the
Dragonball series, we learn that they lived on Planet Plant.&nbsp; They shared
this planet with a race called tsufuru-jin.&nbsp; The tsufuru-jins were an
advanced race with many cities and highly-advanced technology. Their technology
allowed them to fight against the naturally strong saiya-jins. The saiya-jins
were strong savages who lived in wastelands attacking the tsufuru-jins at times.
Because the saiya-jins had the natural ability of fighting using their bare
hands, they were a force to be reckoned on. Fortunately for the tsufuru-jins,
they were able to defend their planet with their technologies. Then, one night
on the full moon, all the saiya-jins who had been exposed to the light of the
full moon, underwent the change into Oozaru (Giant Ape) and easily crushed the
tsufuru-jins out of existence.&nbsp; From then on the planet was called Planet
Vegeta.</font>
</p>
		  
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The saiya-jins used some of the tsufuru-jin
technology to become the strongest race in the universe.
The strongest being in the universe, Freeza, an evil creature, used the
saiya-jins as mercenaries to take over planets for him and sell them. One day,
the saiya-jins got tired of working for Freeza, so the king, King Vegeta,
revolted with several of his loyal men.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he was killed along
with his men.&nbsp; Freeza then destroyed Planet Vegeta in one giant blast, along
with the entire saiya-jin race. Only a few saiya-jins survived, including
Kakarotto (Goku), Prince Vegeta, Raditzu, Nappa, Taurus, Paragus and Brolli.</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><img border="0" src="http://www.dbzgtlegacy.com/pix/gokusaiyan.jpg" align="left" width="96" height="269">This
is the typical appearance of a saiya-jin. A normal saiya-jin has black hair, a
thick, strong, muscular body, and a unique tail. Saiya-jins have the excellent
natural fighting ability that causes them to consume a great amount of calories
daily. In order to provide these calories, they eat a lot. Goku, a low-class
saiya-jin, consumes about 10 times the appetite a normal human would eat daily.
Compared to humans, saiya-jins are extremely strong. Even when hit by a Bulma's
car in the beginning of the Dragonball series, Goku was not hurt. He immediately
stood up after he was hit.</font></p>

Freeza's worst fear... the Super Saiya-jin. This
level is a legend early in Dragonball Z, but eventually becomes a natural form. Goku is
the second person to ever reach this level, but is the first one we ever see
doing it. When reaching this level the Saiya-jin's hair turns goldish blond, the
eye's turn green, and
his power level rises greatly. The Legendary SSJ mentioned throughout the
series is Brolli. Super Saiya-jin are supposed to be ruthless killing machines,
but we see that the Saiya-jin's personality barely changes after the
transformation. The Super Saiya-jin
level is triggered by emotional rage (usually). It can only be reached by
someone with a pure heart of good or evil. Once reached the status of super
saiya-jin, the Saiya-jin can go SSJ
at will.</font></p>

</b>This stage is between SSJ and SSJ 2. During this
stage the Saiya-jin's muscles greatly increase in size. The Saiya-jin becomes
very strong, but also very slow.&nbsp; Attacks would do a lot of damage, but it is
unlikely to hit the opponent. When Goku and his son, Gohan were training in
the Room of Gravity and Time during the Cell saga, Goku demonstrated this stage to Gohan, and told him
that it was useless because of it's drawback of making a saiya-jin usually slow.
This stage's disadvantage is demonstrated as Trunks fights Cell and is
beaten.</font></p>

</b>This stage was first reached by Gohan while fighting Evil Cell in the Cell
Game. This stage is very much like the first Super Saiya-jin stage, but of course
much stronger. Occasionally, the Saiya-jin who is in the form has electricity going around his body and through it. That's how you can tell the difference between SSJ
and SSJ2. Also a Saiya-jin level 2 has slightly longer hair. This level is more
superior than ssj level 1 in terms of strength and speed. It is also triggered
by extreme rage.</font></p>

</b>Goku is the first and only person besides Gotenks
to reach this stage. It is one of the strongest forms in all of Dragonball.
You can tell a Saiya-jin is SSJ 3 when they have gold hair like all the other
forms before it, and their hair gets really long and full. Also, the Saiya-jin's
eyebrows disappear. This level is only achieved through training. After training
in Heaven during the period of time after the Cell saga, Goku learned how to
transform to ssj3. This form brings more power and speed, but because it uses
more energy, a saiya-jin can only stay in this form for a short period of time.</font></p>

</b>This stage was made by TOEI Animation and was
nothing to do with the original author of Dragonball, Akira Toriyama. During this stage the Saiya-jin's tail grows back.
Their eyes turn yellow with a red outline around the eyes. The palm contains a
hole that can absorb energy. Their back and most of their body is covered with red fur. The hair stays black,
but gets long, not as long as SSJ 3. And again the Saiya-jin gets unbelievably
powerful. Goku is the only real person to reach this level, but Buruma creates a
device that turns Vegeta into a SSJ 4 also. This form is triggered by extreme
rage, anger and sorrow.</font></p>

</b>When a Saiya-jin with a tail is
exposed to pure
moonlight (from any moon) he turns into a gigantic 20-foot tall, ape-like creature. The Saiya-jin's power
level is increased ten times when turning Oozaru (Oozaru is the Japanese word
for &quot;Big Monkey&quot;) Saiya-jin's used this form to
take over planets for Freeza. This form is possibly the most powerful form under
SSJ level 3.&nbsp; All saiya-jins, except Goku and Gohan were able to control
themselves during this form.</font></p>

This stage is much like the regular Oozaru stage
except that the fur is golden not brown and it's of course much stronger. This
is also made by TOEI. To reach this stage a Saiya-jin must have a tail and must receive
more waves from the moonlight. The only ones to ever reach this stage was Goku
and Bebi Vegeta during Dragonball GT. Vegeta reached it while Bebi was inside of
him and attacked his friends. He was eventually defeated by Goku.</font></p>
