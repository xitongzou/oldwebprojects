INTRODUCTION - DRAGONBALL Z HYPER DIMENSION
==============================================================================

  In 1996, two years after DRAGONBALL Z 3 - SUPER BUTOUDEN, one of the popular
DRAGONBALL Z fighting games of the DRAGONBALL Z SUPER BUTOUDEN saga, was
released and a year after the success of the fourth DRAGONBALL Z game for the
Super Nintendo, the fighting-rpg - DRAGONBALL Z - THE LEGEND OF THE SUPER
SAIYA-JIN, made its way through the gaming market, BANDAI again introduced
another one of their DRAGONBALL Z masterpieces - a one of a kind and a must-
have: DRAGONBALL Z - HYPER DIMENSION. The release of the game surprised and
amazed the public, being very innovative and having highly sophisticated
three-dimensional graphics and very fun gameplay. Due to its complexity and
its highly advanced development, DRAGONBALL Z - HYPER DIMENSION unsurprisingly
made it to the top, being one great game of its own kind that rivaled even
those of the PSX games.

  But unlike the previous DRAGONBALL Z fighting games of the DRAGONBALL Z
SUPER BUTOUDEN saga, there have been some changes in DRAGONBALL Z - HYPER
DIMENSION. The line that separates the characters have been purposely removed,
transforming it into a more Street Fighter kind of game, adding much to the
challenge. Life and Ki bars have been replaced by a LIFE-KI connection feature
PLUS the Regenerate feature also. The flight button have been taken out as
well, and have been replaced by an interesting Multi-Level Shift System (MLS
System). Moreover, the new Three Dimensional Assault Command (3-DA Command)
AND the Three Dimensional Battle System (3-DB System) adds to another of its
new appealing battle features. Of course, the METEO ATTACKS and DESPERATION
MOVES remain but with a little bit of modification. I would recommend this
excellent game to everyone especially to those who are die-hard fans of both
DRAGONBALL Z and anime alike. Enjoy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MY PERSONAL RATINGS FOR THE GAME:

Storyline: 7.7/10 - The game covers up the last three sagas of Dragonball Z.
Graphics:  9.8/10 - The graphics are terrific! The character frames very much
                    detailed and most of the backgrounds are realistic. The
                    projectiles are nice, too. However, when some desperation
                    moves are performed in a close distance, the graphics of
                    the projectiles are cut-off. Projectile transparency also
                    was a minus to the game, forming little up to no effect
                    at all. But to top all of that, the over-all graphics are
                    excellent.
Music:     7.8/10 - It's okay for a fighting game...
Game Play: 8.9/10 - If you love fighting games then you're gonna like this!

Overall:   8.6/10 - Not bad for a fighting game! Superb!

STORY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The story starts where the TV animation left off. It begins at the point
when Son Gokou has reached planet Namek to battle and prevent Freeza from
gathering all the seven magical Dragon Balls and wishing for immortality. It
goes on until the creation of Android Cell and his Perfect transformation up
to the Buu saga, where Buu, an evil demon sealed long ago comes to earth from
another dimension and wrecks havoc.

  Once you begin STORY MODE, you will start off as Piccolo and engage in a
battle with Freeza, so as to give time for Son Gokou to gather up enough
energy for the Genkidama to finally destroy Freeza. But the assault fails to
kill the Planet Destroyer, and Piccolo gets badly wounded and prevents him
from being able to fight anymore. So now,  Son Gokou must fight Freeza alone.
Son Gokou's power is then triggered by his anger as he witnesses the death of
his best friend, Klilyn, courtesy of Freeza himself. He turns into Super
Saiya-jin, the legendary warrior that Freeza fears the most and then
commences into battle with the evil soldier. Well, the rest is up to you to
find out and discover!

The stages and stage levels are as follows:

EARTH--

                         is considered as a GROUND level.
2 = Heaven             - In this SKY level, the palace of Kami is visible and
                         the world can be seen in a "heavenly" way. It seems
                         beyond the earth's atmosphere since the clouds can be
                         seen from above.
3 = Sky                - In this SKY level, you battle in the skies a hundred
                         kilometers above the earth!
4 = Island             - A perfect place for a perfect battle away from
                         innocents.
5 = Tenkaichi Budoukai - The Martial Arts Tournament Ring.
6 = Burning City       - A previously populated city becomes a battleground!

NAMEK--

7 = Crater             - Considered as SKY level, you battle right above the
                         planet's dangerous region as Namek nears its end.
8 = Namek Grounds      - A GROUND level in planet Namek.

LEVELS EXPLAINED:

GROUND LEVEL - This is the part of the stage or location where the characters'
               feet are affixed to the ground, with the exception of Freeza,
               since he naturally flies around.

SKY LEVEL    - This is the part of the stage or location where, when the
               characters battle in it, they automatically use the technique
               called "Bukuujutsu", or, in translation, "No Air", which then
               enable them to fly.

Legends:

### = Vigor Meter - Shows you how much KI and Vigor you have left. It connects
                    with the Life Force Bar as well as with the Regeneration
                    Meter. When certain moves are performed, this number
                    decreases. This determines your KI energy. You can perform
                    as much of these KI-minus moves as you want until this goes
                    down to zero. But this number dropping to zero will not
                    disable you from performing Ki-minus moves. It will however
                    use your Life Force instead and drain you when you attempt
                    to use Ki-minus moves. You can prevent this by keeping this
                    number as high as possible using the Regenerate move. Not
                    only does this number affect your energy usage but it does
                    affect how much damage you can take before you truly get
                    hurt too. When you receive damage and this number is high,
                    your Life Force will not go down. Instead, the Vigor Meter
                    will take the damage for you. When this goes down to zero,
                    you will become more vulnerable to attacks. By regenerating
                    this, your Life Force will slowly increase as well.
( ) = Regen Meter - Regeneration Meter. This counts how much KI and Vigor you
                    are regenerating when you perform the regeneration move.
                    One whole turn of the blue clock-like thing will add 5 KI/
                    Vigor Points and also a percent in your Life Force.
=== = Life Force  - This shows you how much life you have left before you get
                    defeated. This can be refilled using the Regenerate move.
<platform one>    - This is the main battleground. It's where you are.
<platform two>    - This is the second platform in the game (a.k.a. MIDDLE
                    GROUND). When a character performs his specific Three
                    Dimensional Assault, he moves away from the opponent and
                    then into the second platform and back into the first to
                    finish off his attack.

   ---ADVANCED MOVES-:-NEUTRAL------------------------------------------------

   THESE ARE THE ADVANCED MOVES YOU CAN PERFORM ON BOTH GROUND AND SKY LEVELS:

   Y + B = REGENERATE      - RESTORE YOUR LIFE AND KI BY HOLDING BOTH Y AND B
                             AT THE SAME TIME.
   F,B,F + X  = SIDE BASH  - BASH YOUR OPPONENT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
                             SCREEN TO ENTER A NEW SIDE LEVEL. WILL NOT WORK
                             IF LOCATION SHIFT IS OFF.
   B,DB,D,DF,F + A = KI 45 - PERFORMING THIS MOVE WILL ALLOW YOUR CHARACTER
                             TO BLAST OFF A 45-DEGREE SUPER PROJECTILE
                             EQUIVALENT TO A FIRST-SECOND DEGREE INBETWEEN
                             PROJECTILE. THE DIRECTION OF THE PROJECTILE HAVE
                             TWO POSSIBILITIES: 45 DEGREES GOING UP OR 45
                             DEGREES GOING DOWN, DEPENDING ON THE POSITION
                             OF YOUR CHARACTER AGAINST THE OPPONENT. IN GROUND
                             LEVEL, THE DIRECTION IS 45-UP. IN SKY LEVEL, IF
                             YOU ARE BELOW THE OPPONENT, IT'S 45-UP, WHILE
                             IF HE'S EITHER INFRONT OF YOU OR BELOW YOU, IT
                             GOES 45-DOWN. GOOD AGAINST JUMPING OPPONENTS.
   D,DB,B,F + A = SUPER    - PERFORMING THIS MOVE WILL ENABLE YOUR CHARACTER
                             TO DO A HORIZONTAL SUPER PROJECTILE ATTACK AT
                             YOUR OPPONENT, WHICH HAS THREE DEGREES, AND THEIR
                             VISUAL APPEARANCE AND STRENGTH MAY VARY DEPENDING
                             ON HOW LONG YOU HOLD A. FIRST DEGREE WILL RESULT
                             IN A SMALL FORM OF ENERGY RELEASE, WHILE SECOND
                             DEGREE IS A MUCH BIGGER KI BLAST, AND LAST,
                             HOLDING THE A BUTTON THE LONGEST TIME, WILL ALLOW
                             YOUR CHARACTER TO PRODUCE A HUGE AND POWERFUL
                             BLAST OF CONCENTRATED ENERGY TOWARDS YOUR
                             OPPONENT THAT COULD DEAL MASSIVE DAMAGE. HOWEVER,
                             NOT ALL THE CHARACTERS' DESPERATIONS CAN REACH
                             THE THIRD DEGREE. SOME EVEN HAVE ONLY ONE. IT ALL
                             DEPENDS ON THE CHARACTER.

   ---ADVANCED MOVES-:-GROUND-------------------------------------------------

   THESE ARE ADVANCED MOVES YOU CAN PERFORM ONLY ON GROUND LEVEL:

   FF = FORWARD HOP        - HOP TOWARDS YOUR OPPONENT.
   BB = BACKWARD HOP       - HOP AWAY FROM YOUR OPPONENT.
   F + X = THROW           - AT CLOSE RANGE, PERFORM THIS MOVE TO GRAB AND
                             THROW YOUR OPPONENT.
   D,DF,F + X = UPPER BASH - BASH YOUR OPPONENT UPWARDS TO BATTLE AT SKY LEVEL
                             (IF SKY LEVEL IS UNAVAILABLE OR IF LOCATION SHIFT
                             IS TURNED OFF, THIS WILL ONLY BE EQUIVALENT TO A
                             REGULAR ATTACK AND WILL NOT MAKE YOU SWITCH TO
                             SKY LEVEL).
   DESPERATION             - The Meteo Attacks, or Desperation Moves vary for
                             every character, and will only work if your life
                             is flashing red. To add to that, they are  very
                             hard to perform so you may not get the results
                             you desire at all times.

   ---ADVANCED MOVES-:-SKY----------------------------------------------------

   THESE ARE THE MOVES YOU CAN PERFORM ONLY AT SKY LEVEL:

   U + Y      = UPPER HIT  - FLY UPWARDS AND HIT YOUR OPPONENT!
   D + B      = LOW ATTACK - FLY DOWNARDS AND HIT YOUR OPPONENT!
   D,DB,B + X = EARTH BASH - SLAM YOUR OPPONENT TO THE EARTH WHILE AT SKY
                             LEVEL (IF LOCATION SHIFT IS TURNED OFF, THIS
                             WILL ONLY BE EQUIVALENT TO A REGULAR ATTACK AND
                             WILL NOT MAKE YOU SWITCH TO GROUND LEVEL).

   ---SUPER MOVES-------------------------------------------------------------

   All characters have two (2) Super Moves, one being shot at 45-degree
   angle and the other one, the much more powerful one, which goes straight
   forward. In the ADVANCED MOVES : NEUTRAL part of this FAQ, I gave the
   following nicknames to both desperations:

   KI 45   - Since it's a KI attack fired at a 45-degree angle
   SUPER   - Since it's strong

   The command for the KI 45 move is: B,BD,D,DF,F + A

   As for the SUPER move: D,BD,B,F + A

   Some SUPER moves could be charged up to third degree to deal major damage
   by holding the A button when the command is inputted.

   Keep in mind that performing these moves will subtract quite an amount of
   life from your Life Force, so use at your own risk.

   [ OTHER BATTLE NOTATIONS ]-------------------------------------------------

   ---UCHIKAESU---"COUNTER ATTACK"--------------------------------------------

   If you've noticed, a faint spark is produced when you block an attack. As
   long as this spark is still present, you can perform a counter-attack. In
   order to do this, pull off any special move as long as the spark shimmers.

   ---COLLISSIONS ON GROUND LEVEL---------------------------------------------

   When two punches or kicks meet each other on ground level, the two will
   engage in a short, automatic physical battle. Afterwards, both characters
   will jump away from each other and crouch. When this happens, you can
   perform a hands free massive projectile attack. In order to do this,
   during the crouching position, be the first to press any of the following
   buttons and perform their effects:

   A - If you decide to press A, then press it, but DON'T LET GO! Holding A
       will make you fire a regular KI Assault and then charge-up a third
       degree desperation projectile and fire it!
   B - KI Assault followed by first degree desperation projectile
   X - KI Assault followed by first degree desperation projectile
   Y - KI Assault followed by first degree desperation projectile

   ---COLLISSIONS ON SKY LEVEL AND THE THREE DIMENSIONAL BATTLE SYSTEM--------

   Now when two kicks or punches collide on SKY level, you will get the chance
   to eradicate your opponent while he defends or vice versa, with the help
   of the game's very innovative THREE DIMENSIONAL BATTLE SYSTEM.

   The 3-DB System performs much like the game's 3-DA Command feature, except
   that the one who goes to the second platform is the one who gets the chance
   to defend, and that he goes much farther unto the background, while the
   character in the first platform gets to damage the defender. If the one who
   attacks fails to connect a Massive Ki Assault towards the defender in one
   round, then the two shifts places and roles. The previous attacker will now
   defend while the previous defender will be the one to attack. The battle
   will end only if a Massive KI Assault connects. Be noted that you can
   fire as many KI bolts as you want but they deal very little damage, and
   doing just that so will possibly take forever. Anyway, the 3-DB goes like
   this...

   IF YOU ARE THE ATTACKER--
   You will end up staying in the foreground to attack your opponent who will
   happen to be staying in the background for the meantime. He gets to defend
   himself, though. You get to attack using...

   A = "Renzoku Energy Dan" ("Consecutive Energy Bullets")
     - Pressing A will allow you to fire three consecutive enregy bullets

   B = Massive Ki Assault
     - Pressing B will cause your character to fire a strong KI attack

   IF YOU ARE THE DEFENDER--
   You'll be in the second platform at the very end of the background and will
   *TRY* to deflect your opponent's KI assaults or dodge his massive one.

   X = Deflect Renzoku Energy Dan
     - This will allow you to throw away your opponent's energy bullets

   Y = Dodge Massive Ki Assault
     - You get the chance to avoid your opponent's Massive Ki Assault with Y

   What's the thing with this one is that it's just plain luck. You'll never
   know what the upcoming attack is, whether it's the energy bullets or the
   strong KI energy bolt. The best way is to just select Y to be safe since
   the energy bullets don't do much damage anyway even if they hit you.

GENERAL FORMS INFORMATION
==============================================================================

  You may encounter different forms of the different characters in the game.
In order to further explain the different visuals that you'll be seeing which
you might not be familiar with, I have provided this section in dedication
to the different characters' different forms and a basic information about
the certain form or transformation. I have purposely disregarded Buu's forms
because I don't have the time to put them here, and I was never in the mood to
do so. If anyone could provide me with his forms, please e-mail me immediately
and you will be properly acknowledged.

  ---SUPER SAIYA-JIN LEVELS INFORMATION---------------------------------------

  All individuals carrying the blood of a Saiya-jin has the ability to
  increase their power levels and attain a Super Saiya-jin level, whether or
  not they are full-blooded Saiya-jins. This can either be achieved through
  rigorous training, will power or can be triggered by emotions. But not all
  can go beyond the first level, and only a few were able to go beyond that.
  By turning into Super Saiya-jin, one's powers increase in a variety of ways
  depending on which level is attained. The Super Saiya-jin levels are then
  explained in this section to help you further determine which is which.

  SAIYA-JIN             - A race of ruthless warriors that possesses intense
                          power and many potentials. As a Saiya-jin, one
                          becomes stronger for every battle fought. The level
                          at which a Saiya-jin's power can reach has many
                          possibilities.
  SUPER SAIYA-JIN       - In order to reach the first level of a Super
                          Saiya-jin, one must have the will to go beyond the
                          normal level. At this state, the Saiya-jin's
                          muscles increase a little, an energy glow envelops
                          the body and the hair rises a bit and turns golden
                          blonde. The power level greatly increases including
                          speed and strength.
  ULTRA SUPER SAIYA-JIN - This level is attained when a Saiya-jin strives to
                          go beyond the levels of a Super Saiya-jin. At this
                          stage, the Saiya-jin's muscles greatly become huge
                          covered by a brighter glow of energy. The hair
                          becomes golden blonde, more erect and more depth
                          of the hair can be seen. This greatly increases a
                          Saiya-jin's strength, but does the opposite to the
                          speed of the Saiya-jin.
  SUPER SAIYA-JIN TWO   - Anger triggers this transformation. At this stage,
                          the Saiya-jin's muscles develop and the body is
                          engulfed by a very bright energy glow and surrounded
                          by small, electric waves. The hair stands up, while
                          to some, a single strand remains hanging by the
                          forehead, and turns golden blonde, and the depths
                          are much more visible. During this transformation,
                          strength, speed and power increases greatly to a
                          much more higher extent than the first two
                          transformations.
  SUPER SAIYA-JIN THREE - When a Saiya-jin reaches this Super Saiya-jin level,
                          the muscles increase slightly and the body is again
                          covered by a bright glow of energy. The eyebrows
                          disappear and the hair turns golden blonde, plus, it
                          grows long behind the Saiya-jin's back with a much
                          more visible depth. It gives more power and speed.
                          But due to its high energy consumption, the time
                          to stay in this level is limited.

  ---FREEZA FORMS INFORMATION-------------------------------------------------

  During Freeza's introductory animation, you will see his four different
  forms as he transforms into Perfect Freeza, his final form. Coming from a
  race that could change forms, Freeza has the ability to transform into any
  of his forms, one being stronger than the first. Though you could only use
  his final form, his transformation forms are explained here.

  FORM ONE: ARMORED FREEZA   - Freeza's first form is a small creature wearing
                               Saiya-jin-like armor, his head looks like a
                               horned helmet, and his skin is of a shade of
                               red striped with black lines. He is weaker in
                               this stage, and is able to hide his powers more
                               so he wastes less  energy while at this form.
  FORM TWO: GIANT FREEZA     - At this form, his muscles grow enormously and
                               so does his size, strength and power. His horns
                               also bends into a right angle and his armor
                               breaks. He gains more strength and power during
                               this form.
  FORM THREE: MONSTER FREEZA - During this transformation, Freeza's horns turn
                               white and multiplies into four. His head grows
                               longer in a curved form, his shoulder pads
                               slants and he becomes more lizard-like. His
                               power level becomes stronger at this point.
  FORM 4: PERFECT FREEZA     - Freeza's final transformation. He becomes
                               shorter than he really is, his skin becomes all
                               white in color and his power tremendously
                               increases. He looks more human and weaker at
                               this form but his powers are intense.

  ---CELL FORMS INFORMATION---------------------------------------------------

  Cell has many transformations. In his introductory animation, we see him
  transform from his second stage to his Perfect Cell stage. He achieves Cell
  form number two by means of absorbing Android Number 17 and reaches Perfect
  Cell by absorbing Android Number 18. Although his first form isn't shown
  in his introductory animation and that you could only use his final form, I
  will explain the differences of his different forms.

  FORM ONE: IMPERFECT CELL      - In his first stage, his mouth is looks like
                                  capsule, his head has a fan-shaped covering
                                  and an oblongated gem by his forehead. He
                                  has a pair of beetle-like wings and a sharp
                                  stinger extends upon his back. He is weak at
                                  this form, though by using his tail to "eat"
                                  creatures, he is able to increase his power
                                  level. And by absorbing Android Number 18,
                                  he becomes more powerful and turns into his
                                  next stage.
  FORM TWO: SEMI-PERFECT CELL   - At this stage, Cell's physical appearance
                                  changes a bit. The covering on his head
                                  more or less becomes like horns that extend
                                  above his head and the gem upon his forehead
                                  is further revealed as a crystal ball-like
                                  thing which forms the upper part of his head
                                  in the middle of his "horns". His mouth also
                                  changes from a capsule into a human-like one
                                  covered by thick lips. The frame of his head
                                  becomes covered and his muscles grow bigger.
                                  His power greatly increases and so does his
                                  speed and defense.
  FORM THREE: PERFECT CELL      - By finally being able to absorb Android
                                  Number 18, Cell reaches his perfect form. In
                                  this stage, his face resembles that of a
                                  human and the thick lips disappear. His
                                  chest plate, shoulder pads turn from green
                                  to black, and his tail hides behind his back
                                  and his muscles increase slightly. His power

CHARACTER INFORMATION AND MOVE LIST
==============================================================================

  I have created a general information about every character and added their
moves as well and how to perform them, their original Japanese move names and
of course, their translation. The characters are listed according to the way
they are presented in the "Character Selection Screen" section of this FAQ.

  Each character move list is composed of several parts: above is the name of
the character and the category they are under. The character type might also
be included before the name. After that is a general information about the
character, followed by a general move list. After those are the special moves,
super moves and desperation moves. The moves are further given translations
and explanations. As for the command moves, directional commands are written
in capitals while button commands are written in capitals enclosed in
(parenthesis). Concerning super moves, the number of level or degree it can
achieve is also listed down, while some notes and/or comments will be found
for the desperation moves (meteo smash). Note that those moves having no
translations are moves directly translated from Katakana to Romaji, so writing
down the translation name for that move will not make any difference other
than seeing the move name twice, while self-named moves will be identified.
There may also be some cases wherein I just named the move myself. I don't
own the manual but am just familiar with the anime, so moves that I have not
heard of or have never seen before were just self-named. Those with "?"
under Translation are just self-named moves, while those with "Actual" are
either moves translated into Romaji or moves I'm pretty sure they are actually
named with. If you own the manual (which you probably don't that's why you got
my FAQ) and know Japanese, please send me the right move name(s) right away.
Move names/corrections that you send that are taken from other FAQs will not
be posted. Thanks.

VEGETA [MAJIN SUPER SAIYA-JIN LEVEL TWO PRINCE VEGETA]              Z SOLDIERS
==============================================================================

  Considering that he is in his Majin form, I still preferred to put him under
the Z SOLDIERS category, since he is just under a spell and is naturally a
part of the Z TEAM. Anyway, to begin with Vegeta's information, he is the
prince of all Saiya-jins, ruling the once existing planet from where he came
from, Vegeta, as the son of King Vegeta. He was later on sent away by Freeza
with Nappa to another planet when Freeza destroyed his planet. As he returned,
Freeza informed him that a meteor hit Planet Vegeta, and he instantly believed
the lies of Freeza. He later served Freeza as his right-hand man and helped
him conquer many planets and sell them, until he was later eventually sent off
to earth with his companion Nappa and Gokou's brother, Raditz. There, as the
Z SOLDIERS beat Raditz, he learned about the Dragon Balls and wanted to gain
immortality, so they set off to earth but were defeated by Gokou, whereas his
companion died under his own hands. He later trains to become stronger than
Gokou so that he could finally beat him. However, he realizes that Freeza was
also after the Dragon Balls and learns about the Namek-jin Dragon Balls, and
then sets off to planet Namek and meets up with the Z TEAM as well as with
Freeza. He planned to destroy Freeza but was later mocked and told the truth
about the fate of their planet, which Freeza informs Vegeta that he destroyed
and that he was a fool to believe about his lies. Although Vegeta tried to
battle Freeza, he eventually died, but was later brought to life by the Dragon
Balls. He continued to train to bypass Gokou's power as the story progressed,
and was also able to achieve the first Saiya-jin Level up to the Second one
between the Android Saga and the Majin Buu Saga. Because of his desire to be
much stronger than Gokou, he allowed himself to be enchanted by Babi-di's
magic, promising him high level of power, possessed by Madoshi Babidi, thus,
the "M" in his forehead.

VEGETTO [SUPER SAIYA-JIN LEVEL TWO VEGETTO]                         Z SOLDIERS
==============================================================================

  With the performance of the fusion dance, Vegeta and Gokou fuses to create
the world's strongest warrior - Gogeta! But after defusing, Vegeta, with all
his pride, never wanted to ever fuse again due to the fusion dance, which he
thinks is absurd, pathetic and very humiliating. But Gokou found a way to fuse
with him again without the requirement of the dance. Instead, with the potara
earrings of Kaioshin, they fuse again, this time to become Vegetto!

   Vegetto only appeared a few times. Although the fusion with the potara
earrings were supposed to be permanent, entering Buu changed the law of
physics and separated them, which led Vegeta into shattering the other earring
and thus ending the possibilities of seeing Vegetto again.

   Vegetto is quite different from Gogeta. Gogeta doesn't waste any time in
battle and likes to finish his opponent out easily, while Vegetto, on the
other hand, is just as arrogant as Gotenks who enjoy taking his sweet time in
fights which also leads to his downfall.

you end up playing a computer-controlled Gotenks, something weird happens. 
When his life bar is flashing red, he could use his desperation move, the 
volleyball thing. Nothing weird about that, except when he finishes doing 
it(it has to hit you, i think) He won't do anything anymore, he won'even 
walk. He just stands there ready to be defeated.

Well, that was my info, hope you can use it.

Justus knows something, but not all. 
FIRST: he USES his desperation move (not could)
SECOND: you have to BLOCK it, if you avoid it then nothing weird is happening
THIRD: after you block it, the CPU Gotenks becames the player #2.

The CPU for any mode of the game has a little querk with some of the
characters. If you are thrown down (X+direction), usually the computer does
the exact same thing, depending on what direction you are thrown. For example,
if SS2 Goku throws you to the left, he will almost always use the Two Kicks
attack. If he throws you to the right, he will almost always use the Abesergi
- Jump Knee Lift combination. Almost all characters have querks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now I will discuss the intricacies of ground and air-combos in DBZ-HD.  If
any of you have played X-Men VS Street Fighter, Marvel VS Street Fighter, 
Marvel VS Capcom 1 and 2, and the Rival School Series... then you'd feel
right at home with this game. :)

Like all air combos, they must start with a "launcher".  To launch someone
in the air, one must perform a regular attack (a Punch or a Kick) followed
immediately by the so-called "launcher" which is performed by pressing Punch
and Kick simultaneously (yes, yes... exactly the same command as the CHARGE/
REGENERATE technique).  That's the basic launcher.  Other characters have
launchers within their own special moves... for example, Goku's charging
double-punch (D, DF, F + P)

Once the opponent is in mid-air, you are allowed to perform 3 attacks while
your opponent is airborne.  In most mid-air attacks, we will make full use of
the Diagonal Ki Blasts, Super Ki Blasts, and Desperation Moves.

NOTE:  Some characters can use their Desperation Moves on airborne
opponents dealing maximum damage without the chance of retaliation, while
there are others that can only be chained from a ground combo.  And then
there are others that need either a dizzied opponent, or just a real stupid
opponent who cannot block an absolutely avoidable Desperation Move.

Now let's move on to the characters, shall we?

(I'll just jot down the combos I use the most, since there are a LOT of
possible combos to execute)

SON GOKU
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moves List:

Side Slash                Hold [L] or [R] + K

JK, SP, SP, SP, Double Punch (Launcher), P, Kamehameha, Kamehameha
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special note concerning Goku:

The trick to performing Goku's Desperation Move successfully is that you need
to anticipate how fast your opponent gets up after he has fallen.  Since
Goku's Genki Dama attack is unblockable, if you can time it to connect right
after your opponent has gotten up, then your opponent is in for quite a treat.

VEGETA
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vegeta's Cheese: :)

Driving Elbow, Galactic Gunfire (when Driving Elbow is blocked)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special note concerning Vegeta:

As you've noticed, most of my combos start with a JP (Jumping Punch).  Why?
Because there's a strong possibility that it becomes a cross over combo...
making it difficult for your opponent to know which direction to block.
Pretty nifty, wouldn't you say? :)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==============================================================================
GOTENKS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moves List:

Ultra Headbutt            Hold [L] or [R] + P

Full Power Kikou Ha

<corner>
JP, SP, SP, P+K (Launcher), Full Power Kikou Ha, SP, Full Power Kikou Ha

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special note concerning Gotenks:

Most of Gotenks' combos are air jugglers... so you may tinker around with
other aerial assaults once you've successfully launcher your opponent in
mid-air.

Since Gotenks' Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack is a guided projectile, they are
most effective in the SKY Levels.  So here's a quick SKY Level Launcher for
Gotenks... (JP, SP, SP, UB)... and once you've reached the SKY Level, pour
on with your Renzoku Shine Shine Missiles and Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack. :)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==============================================================================
MYSTIC GOHAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moves List:

Zanzouken Rushing Knee    Hold [L] or [R] + K
Jet Upper                 F + P

<corner>
JK, SP, SP, P+K (Launcher), Masenkou, CP, Jet Upper

JK, SP, SP, P+K (Launcher), Masenkou, SP, Kamehameha(L2)
(You could try and use the Kamehameha(L3) as your finale... but it takes
either perfect timing or just sheer luck to execute it.  The key lies on
the timing of the SP before the Kamehameha... and of course, the Kamehameha(L3)
will only connect on lighter opponents like Gotenks and Buu)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special note concerning Gohan (and to those unfamiliar with the Guile Combo):

Gohan's combos are like Guile's wherein you must charge Down or Back
while you're performing your aerial assault (JK or JP) so that by the time
you land, you are ready to execute the charged attack right after a regular
attack. (e.g. JK (hold D right away), CP, (...and then releasing D to perform
the...) Zankuu Kyaku)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JK, SP, SP, P+K (Launcher), Gekiretsukoudan, SK, Kakusan Yuudouko Dan
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special note concerning Piccolo:

He may not have as much combos as the others, but they are pretty darn
impressive to look at!  His Bukuu Kyaku helps a lot when evading projectiles,
and his Regenerate Counter Attack works best when countering a rushing attack
like Gohan's Bakuretsu Punch.  But the most impressive aspect about Piccolo
is the fact that he's one of the few Z-Warriors who can end his combos with
his Desperation Move easilly... dealing a heckuvalotta damage!  And noone can
accuse him of being cheesy. :)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Special note concerning Majin Buu:

Being the heaviest among the DBZ-HD fighters, he's the hardest to air combo
since there's not much elevation when he's launched.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KID BUU
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moves List:

Buu Rolling Attack        Hold [L] or [R] + P

JP, SP, P+K (Launcher), Energy Bullet, SP, Energy Bullet
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special note concerning Kid Buu:

I'm not quite fond of this guy's combos.  But he's pretty good at zoning your
opponents using your Renzoku Energy Dan.  To make a quick horizontal 3-hitter,
Dash Forward or Backward (tapping the direction of your choice twice) then
quickly perform the Renzoku Energy Dan.  When you dash/hop forward/backward,
it's already considered as being in mid-air (even for a split second)... and
that's when you can perform your aerial assault.  And this applies to ANYONE.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==============================================================================

-- for fighters who get up slow --
JP, SP, P+K (Launcher), Death Ball, Kikou Ha, Death Ball (wait for opponent
to land, then immediately do the...) Freeza Buster
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special note concerning Freeza:

For those of you who think the Freeza Buster sucks, well... it doesn't.
Yes, it takes too long to charge this monumental projectile, but once
it connects... OH YES!  Good thing I was able to devise a combo for it.
Timing is of the essence, as always.  If only I could find a way to end
a combo with his Spiral Headbutt.  Hmmm... wishful thinking. :P

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special note concerning Cell:

I don't like this guy much.  He's more of a DEFENSE sorta guy.  On offense,
I could only name a few combos (as you've already noticed).  His Desperation
Attack may be quite damaging, but I couldn't find a way to end a good combo
with it.  Oh well, if you want a little cheese, try using the Psychokinesis
every time your opponent gets up.  Or you may want to annoy your opponent
with a barrage of Cell Juniors, Kantsu Energy Dan, and Energy Shots.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well... that's all I can input.  Any questions, just email me or somethin'. :)

ORIGIN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Dragonball Z, that which originated from Dragonball, was actually derived
from the Chinese tale "Journey to the West". Here are a few information about
how the characters of Dragonball/Dragonball Z are related to Journey to the
West. They are arranged the way they were introduced in the story.

My free e-mail service provider that gives me the opportunity to send and 
receive e-mails without going on-line. Honestly, I don't like "@edsamail" coz
it's corny, you know. If you wish to send me an e-mail through this heaven
sent e-mail service provider that has a totally disgusting (sorry) "@ddress",
feel free to do so at dyez@edsamail.com.ph. If you wish to mail me (and take a
longer span of time to get back a response from me) in my e-mail address WITH

My keyboard's been messed-up totally just because of this! Some letters won't

already ruined my work. At present, I know no one who have done so, and I am

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  I accept complaints, comments and suggestions for my FAQ's. These enable me
to further work on my works of literature. If you have any, feel free to drop
me an e-mail. Now, to the real F.A.Q.'s!

Q: Is this your first-ever written FAQ?
A: Nope. This is my fourth one. However, I managed to finish this earlier than
   the third one I wrote.

Q: Can I post your FAQ at my website?
A: It depends upon my decision. If I say yes, you have to follow what's 
   written in the Disclaimer and the Copyright.

Q: Where can I get the latest revisions of the FAQ?
A: You can get the latest revisions of this FAQ either from GAMEFAQs,
   GAMEADVICE, DBZELDA or DBZPLACE.

Q: Can you send me this FAQ?
A: I might be able to, depending on the file size. If this FAQ keeps on
   growing, its file size will also grow. If I am to send this FAQ to you,
   you must have WINZIP first before you could get to open the file
   attachment. Don't complain if I can't send this to you. Just get the
   latest update from any of the addresses that I specified in this FAQ.

Q: Are you ignoring my E-mail's?
A: No. I never do that, but there are just a few complications:
   1) The main reason to that probably is SCHOOL. I've got tons of school
      works like homeworks and projects and final papers and stuffs that I
      really need to get my hands working on. School is my first priority now,
      and I am sometimes busy even during weekends due to the very same
      reason.
   2) I might have trouble with the computer, like a crash or something.
   3) This isn't the only FAQ that I'm working on. Sometimes, I forget to
      check my mail trying to finish a game and writing down an FAQ at the
      same time.
   4) The answer might already be found in the FAQ itself.
