Although very infant-like, He possesses enough power to destroy the world. Fat Buu didn't like taking orders and destroyed Dabura, and later Babidi. The original “Buu creature” (Kid Buu) turned into Fat Buu by absorbing every Kai but the Supreme Kai. Vegeta had underestimated Buu when he decided to go “Majin” and absorb Goku. Vegeta even sacrificed himself to destroy Buu, although it didn't work, (Vegeta got wished back later).  Goku later faced Buu, and even had to go super saiyan 3 to beat him. Buu can change many forms, including the most powerful form: Super Buu, as he can absorb the Z fighters and Goku & Vegeta had to fuse into Vegetto to rip the Z fighters out of him, and Super Buu turned into his “original form”( Kid Buu). Buu had a good side and a bad side to him, and they separated into a “Good Buu” and an “Evil Buu” after super saiyan 3 Goku weakened him, and super saiyan 3 Gotenks laid a whopping on him.. Strangely enough, he's friends with Hercule. Fat Buu also has the ability to turn people into food.<br>Attacks: Buu bomb, mightiness bomber, ki burst, candy munch, shocker.<br>Power level at beginning of DBZ: N/A<br>Power level at end of DBZ: 380,000,000<br>Class: Buu<br></p></body></html>
