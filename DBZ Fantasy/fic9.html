<p>
Deep in the hells, a cloaked figure appears atop the highest spire
of the infernal palace of the Duke of the Hell of Evil
Warriors. Lightning and fire flash across the eternally dark sky as
the great dragon Shen Long looms dimly over the fortress.  The
dragon's head coalesces into full visibility; though it occupies both
worlds, its attention is on the spirit world now, and the answer
awaiting it.  The demon lord's eyes flare with a lurid red light as
he answers the dragon:
<p>
"Hear me, Eternal Dragon. From the Kingdom of Night I release these
ten spirits: Zarbon, restored to power, Raditz, healed of his mortal
wounds, Doddoria, Nappa, Jiisu, Baata, Rikuum, Gurudo, Kyuii, renewed
to life, and Dr. Wheelo, restored to his cyborg form. From dusk of
this fading day until the next dawn, I release them to you, that you
might fulfill the boon requested of you. Come dawn, they are mine once
again."
<p>
The dragon's eyes flare red in answer. "So be it," rumbles its mighty
voice.  Its form shifts to translucency again as its attention returns
to the mortal world, and its mortal petitioner. "Your wish is
granted."

<p>
Goku blinked in surprise at the dark, half-ruined castle that suddenly
appeared around him.  "What??"
<p>
Vegeta appeared beside him in a burst of light. "What?? This is
impossible! How did I get here?  Did someone make a wish?"
<p>
"Where are we?" wondered Goku, looking in all directions. "This place
looks familiar, but that place was on Earth! There's no way we could
be there!"
<p>
"What place?  Kakarott, what do you know about this place?" Vegeta
demanded impatiently.  He hovered in mid-air, looking around warily.
<p>
"When I first met Kurillin, we went on a quest to a castle called the
Devil's Hand. This place reminds me of that." Goku slipped into
fighting stance.
<p>
"Devil's Hand. Stupid name; ugly place." sneered Vegeta. "I'd rather
know who brought us here, and why!"
<p>
"--this from a loser who can't manage a decent haircut?  Hah!"
interrupted a voice from above and behind them.
<p>
Vegeta turned; his eyes went wide with shock.  Goku turned to see what
had rattled Vegeta; a slight, purple, ugly alien, not particularly
powerful. "Huh?"
<p>
"Impossible! I killed you, Kyuii! You must be a ghost!" Vegeta
back-pedalled in mid-air, eyeing his long-dead enemy.  Calm down, he
thought to himself; ghost or not, he doesn't seem any more powerful
than when I last fought him. I'll send him back to whatever grave he
popped out of. Vegeta started to power up.
<p>
"I don't like this," said Goku. "Why would one of your dead enemies be
haunting us in a demon castle from a planet a zillion light-years
away?"
<p>
The shadows moved, and a cold, robotic voice boomed out. "Have you
forgotten the power of the Dragonballs, Goku? Someone made a wish!"
<p>
"I knew it!" muttered Vegeta.
<p>
It was Goku's turn to gape in horror as the robotic body of Dr. Wheelo
clanked out of the shadows ahead of them. "You have enemies, Goku, and
one of them made a wish--a wish that your most powerful enemies would
be returned from the grave to destroy you. Now I will have my
revenge!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA!"
<p>
"Eh, what a lamer! 'Now I will have my revenge, ha-ha-ha'. Talk about
cliches; 'e's got no style whatsoever." From the shadows sprang the
brilliant white-haired, orange-skinned figure of Jiisu, landing in a
ballet-like pose.  "JIISU!" he shouted.
<p>
"BAATA!" The large blue-skinned alien speedster counter-posed with
Jiisu.
<p>
"GURUDO!" the short four-eyed toad-like Ginyu dashed in front.
<p>
"RIKUUM!" the orange-haired giant backed up the other three in their
group pose.
<p>
"TOGETHER, WE ARE.. THE GINYU FORCE!" They held the pose for a moment,
as if expecting applause.  Goku simply stared at them, nonplussed.
Disappointed, they huddled together, discussing their performance.
<p>
"Frankly, I think Team Rocket has a better routine, and are much
better looking," came a dry cultured voice.  Vegeta was not too
surprised to see Zarbon drift out of the shadows, levitating. "Hullo,
Vegeta. Nice to see you again."  He stood on air with his arms crossed.
<p>
"Yeah," snarled a large, ugly, pink alien.  Doddoria tromped out of
the shadows. "In case you two monkeys haven't figured it out, what the
robotic nutcase over there forgot to mention is that the guy who made
the wish wants BOTH of you dead." He laughed nastily.  "I guess he's
afraid you might inconvenience his plans if you get home alive. We're
gonna make sure that doesn't happen."
<p>
"Who are you calling a nutcase?" growled that robotic voice.  Dr
Wheelo raised a large weapon-laden arm and pointed it at Doddoria.
<p>
"VEGETA!" a figure almost as large as Rikuum charged out of the
shadows. "You bastard! You killed me!" Nappa snarled half-coherently.
"I fought for you, followed you, taught you, and you killed me! WHY?"
<p>
Vegeta stared at Nappa, stricken. Everything Nappa said was true, and
he was not proud of it. But--
<p>
"I don't like these odds," Goku said, worried, as he crouched in
fighting stance, eyeing the enemies all around.
<p>
"I have a few suggestions, little brother," said Raditz. Goku jumped
and whirled, noticing his dead elder brother leaning against the
adjacent pillar for the first time.
<p>
Goku watched him warily, "I'm listening."
<p>
"Reduce the odds by weeding out some of the wimps while the Ginyus
spend the next half-hour trying out their cheerleading poses."  Raditz
half-smiled, and started ticking people off on his fingers. "Kyuii's a
wimp, and wants Vegeta, not you.  Nappa--I don't know. He wants some
answers out of Vegeta, but he might go after you--then again, he might
not. Watch out for the big robot guy--he's a bit monomaniacal about
you. He won't be distracted by anything Vegeta does. Zarbon has no
quarrel with you, but Doddoria will quarrel with anyone for the hell
of it. You know about the Ginyus. And then," he smirked, "there's me."
<p>
"Whose side are you on?" frowned Goku. He started to power up.
<p>
"Would you believe me no matter what I told you?"
<p>
Goku shook his head, still frowning.
<p>
Raditz shrugged. "You have good reason not to. When you figure out the
truth, little brother, we've things to talk about " Raditz said, then
disappeared into the shadows.
<p>
"Enough chatter! These fools die now!" thundered Dr. Wheelo. He
leveled his weapon arm at Goku and fired!
<p>
BZZAAPP! KA-BOOM!  Chunks of masonry flew in all directions as
Wheelo's blast took out half the west wall. Goku dodged easily; his
speed and power were inconceivably greater than when Dr. Wheelo had
kidnapped Gohan and tried to steal Goku's body.
<p>
"HEY! Watch it!" Jiisu yelled as a boulder narrowly missed his head and
interrupted his dance routine.
<p>
Nappa screamed in rage and leaped for Vegeta.  Doddoria laughed and
blasted in Vegeta's direction; Vegeta dodged handily.
<p>
"Nappa, you fool! Don't make me kill you again!"
<p>
"You won't have the chance!" Kyuii screamed as he dove on Vegeta,
cutting loose with a barrage of ki blasts at point blank range. His
smirk of triumph turned to dismay as the smoke cleared to reveal
Vegeta standing in mid-air, arms crossed.
<p>
"Is that still the best you can do?  You disgust me!" Vegeta extended
two fingers. The laser-fine blast skewered Kyuii between the eyes; he
fell to the ground, looking slightly surprised. About that time,
Doddoria's energy blast caught Vegeta between the shoulder blades;
Vegeta screamed in sudden agony; a chunk of the north wall
disappeared, scattering the Ginyu Force as Wheelo continued blasting
indiscriminately away at Goku.
<p>
"Screw this," said Jiisu to the other Ginyus. "Let's get Vegeta; that
nutty robot guy wants Goku, he can have him!"
<p>
"Vegeta! Nooooo!" Goku cried out as the Saiyan prince was flung into
the southern wall; in spite of the distraction he continued weaving
and dodging Wheelo's blasts, his pattern bringing both the Ginyu Force
and Nappa into the line of fire.  Jiisu, Baata, and Gurudo dodged;
Rikuum merely shrugged it off; Nappa started to dodge, too slow--and
Raditz tackled him from the shadows, flinging him out of the beam's
path.
<p>
Doddoria laughed and raised his hand for the killing blast; from
above Zarbon's lilting voice called "Don't be greedy, Doddoria, I
want a piece of him, too."  Zarbon's tremendous blast flashed
downward--
<p>
--to strike Doddoria! With a shocked wail, the pink monster
disintegrated.
<p>
Everyone froze.
<p>
"Oops." Zarbon smirked.  "I.. missed."
<p>
Vegeta's head cleared; Kyuii was down and-- fading away? "That's
impossible!" he muttered. Doddoria gone, destroyed by Zarbon's
misdirected blast. Raditz, vanished into the shadows again. Kakarott
holding his own against the robotic Wheelo. Nappa.. still there.
<p>
Vegeta summoned the power for a killing blast, and could not. It
wouldn't come. He screamed in rage, and whirled, blasting full power
at the nearest enemy--Gurudo.
<p>
"Hey!" said Rikuum, looking at the drifting dust. "That wasn't very
nice, disintegrating him like that. Oh well, I guess I get to kill you
instead." The large stupid Ginyu Forcer opened his mouth wide and
exhaled a swirling energy blast not unlike Piccolo's Beam Cannon.
<p>
Vegeta dodged easily; Dr Wheelo, who had been behind him chasing Goku,
did not.  A robotic bellow of rage echoed and re-echoed throughout the
ruined castle as his left arm flew apart.  Vegeta didn't notice; he
was too busy blocking and dodging as Jiisu and Baata double-teamed
him. Rikuum waited below, Zarbon hovered, as if waiting for just the
right opening.  Sweat broke out on his brow; Jiisu, Baata, Rikuum,
Zarbon--there were too many of them!
<p>
Down below, Raditz and Nappa looked at each other; Raditz nodded. Then
both took to the air...
<p>
Goku changed tactics; the odds on Vegeta didn't look good, and
Dr. Wheelo wasn't going to wear down anytime soon. At full speed he
tackled the robotic shell.
<p>
"How does it feel to be the one about to die, Vegeta?" Jiisu
sneered. Barely had the words escaped his mouth when he was flung
forward by a brutal blow to his spine. Raditz! Jiisu had no time to
regret his carelessness in ignoring the rest of the battlefield--
Vegeta's fist drove deep into his gut, and he doubled up with pain.
Momemtarily defenseless, he looked up to see Baata pinned by Naapa,
and that evil smile on Vegeta's face as the Saiyan licked his lips in
anticipation.
<p>
"Oh no, not again!" Jiisu moaned, and then came a very bright flash--
<p>
"No one kills Vegeta until I get some answers," snarled Nappa, as
Baata fought to free himself from Nappa's headlock. Jiisu's ashes
drifted slowly to the floor below.
<p>
"No one kills Prince Vegeta, period," answered Raditz, emphasizing the
word 'Prince'.  He watched Nappa carefully, with an occasional glance
toward Zarbon, who did not seem interested in aiding Baata.
<p>
With a tremendous crash, Wheelo hit the floor--and Rikuum. With
pile-driver blows, Goku smashed the driving mechanism for the legs,
the weapons array on the arms, and for good measure ripped out the
control harness along the spine.  Rikuum bellowed and tossed the
broken shell off his back.
<p>
Trapped within his robotic shell, Wheelo raged impotently. Goku
ignored him, and turned to Rikuum.  A single blow knocked the giant
out.
<p>
Baata was fighting his way out of Naapa's grip. "Well, why not?"
Vegeta said to himself. "Shame to waste an opportunity like this."
<p>
With a swift move, Baata wriggled free before Nappa could tighten his
grip to counter it--only to meet Vegeta's foot in his face. Bones
broke, and the dark blue alien was flung back only to be greeted by
Nappa's bearhug. Nappa squeezed with all his strength;
the veins stood out on his head.  Vegeta could hear Baata's ribs
cracking.
<p>
"Nappa, Nappa, such unnecessary roughness!" Vegeta chided,
mocking. "Let him go!"
<p>
"Sure, Vegeta," Nappa smirked. He suddenly released Baata, who spun
away from Nappa.  His relief was palpable; with distance between him
and the Saiyan giant, there was no way Nappa could move fast enough to
catch him again.  Then Baata looked up and saw Vegeta licking his
lips..
<p>
Nappa winced as the stupendous blast of white energy consumed
Baata. Zarbon still seemed disinclined to interfere; Raditz watched
him and Nappa both, and didn't seem to notice Kakarott rising toward
them.
<p>
Vegeta eyed his former subjects warily. So, Raditz was still his ally,
and Nappa at least wanted to talk first, fight him later. Kakarott
might be a soft-hearted fool, but he was utterly trustworthy and
powerful beyond belief--Vegeta could count on him.  That left
Zarbon. Vegeta faced the green-haired, blue-skinned alien
transmorph. So, Zarbon hasn't transformed yet--that meant he wasn't
ready for a fight just yet. Fool.
<p>
"What are you waiting for, Zarbon? I killed you once, it will be easy
to do it again! You're not afraid, are you?" Vegeta taunted.
<p>
Zarbon sighed. "What's the point? Vegeta, the wish that brought us
back was limited--even if we defeated you, we all go back to Hell at
dawn. So you send me there a few hours earlier--so what? And if we
killed you, wonderful, you go to Hell with us and I get to enjoy your
pleasant company for the rest of eternity."
<p>
Vegeta crossed his arms and scowled at Zarbon, not quite sure what to
make of the alien's fatalism. "So you vanish at dawn?  You're just a
bunch of ghosts brought to life for one night?  I thought you were the
REAL Zarbon," he sneered.
<p>
"Oh, I'm very real, Vegeta. It's just the terms of the wish that
brought us here were limited, and I wasn't consulted on them.  I
wouldn't have minded staying a bit longer--several decades would have
been nice." Zarbon sighed.
<p>
"I killed you, Zarbon. Why don't you want revenge?"
<p>
Zarbon sighed again. "Vegeta, whoever made this wish made one bad
assumption: that all yours and Goku's former enemies would still hate
you more than they did each other.  I'd never even heard of Goku until
I got to Hell, and I never really hated you, Vegeta. I resented being
killed by you, but I got over that when Frieza killed you. That was
all the revenge I needed!"
<p>
A brief shudder ran through Vegeta, almost too brief to see. He
continued as if nothing had happened. "All that tells me is why you
didn't attack me. Why bother to help me against Doddoria?"
<p>
Zarbon smirked. "As I said, some of us hate each other more than we
hate you. You can't even begin to imagine how long I have wished for
the chance to kill that pink thug. Ironic, isn't it? Whoever made this
wish fulfilled one of my fondest wishes--and thwarted his own wish."
<p>
Vegeta's eyes narrowed. There was something fishy about Zarbon's
explanation, but he couldn't put his finger on it.  He never did,
because it never occurred to Vegeta that Zarbon actually liked him in
some small way--and Zarbon would never tell.
<CENTER>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</CENTER>
<p>
"Vegeta." Nappa spoke to his prince. "Why?"
<p>
Vegeta's eyes were half-closed, regret plain on his face. He
sighed. "I should not have killed you. Call it Frieza's teachings, if
you must. I was.. angry." He looked, open-eyed, at Nappa. "You should
not have gone after the child again.  You killed the Namekian, the
source of the Earth's dragonballs--and ruined our whole mission!
There was no turning back after we left without authorization, for
Earth. We'd made our break with Frieza--I had to have the dragonballs
to fight him! After you killed the Namekian, there was only a slim
chance--Namek's dragonballs.  They were still monitoring the scouters,
Nappa. We'd have been racing them to Namek, fighting them for the
dragonballs--as did happen."
<p>
Vegeta sighed again. "And then you just had to go after the child and
Kakarott's friend, when I called you off Kakarott! Kakarott broke your
back for it. You were crippled beyond healing, and could not
fight--and I needed you able to fight on Namek! I suppose I could have
abandoned you to Kakarott's vengeful friends.. or left you to die when
I destroyed the planet.. but a clean kill seemed better."  He
shrugged. "I could not imagine that Kakarott could possibly defeat
me--and even if he did, how could I have guessed that a Saiyan born on
our planet would be so soft as to let his worst enemy go after
defeating him?"
<p>
Nappa's jaw dropped. "You thought you were helping me??" He shook his
head, and finally began to laugh at the bitter irony of it.
<CENTER>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</CENTER>
<p>
"Raditz." Raditz turned his head to look at Goku, suddenly hovering in
mid-air beside him. "I know whose side you're on, but why?"
<p>
"Kakarott," Raditz chose his words carefully as he slowly drifted down
to the floor, Goku drifting with him, "I came to Earth that time
looking for a brother.  I never--" he hesitated, and then pushed on,
"I never meant for it to turn out the way it did.  But-- I'm a
warrior, not a diplomat--and I'm a Saiyan.  I say and do things
that.. aren't wise, and I love to fight even when it's not the right
thing to do."
<p>
Goku frowned. "Raditz, you threatened my friends, promised to
exterminate everyone on Earth, and demanded that I slaughter a hundred
innocent people or you'd kill my son!"
<p>
Raditz shrugged. "I lied."
<p>
"What??"
<p>
"I wouldn't have killed the kid! I was bluffing!  Well, not about
exterminating everyone else on the planet, that was procedure,
but.. not your son. Not that beautiful, wonderful, impossible Saiyan
child."
<p>
"You were still going to kill everyone else! And you expected me to
help you!"
<p>
"They weren't people to me, Kakarott--they weren't Saiyans. Just
whatever local vermin lived on the planet." He held up his hand,
forestalling Goku's angry response. "I know better now, but then--that
was not the way I saw it.  Kakarott, I've been in Hell for good
reason.
<p>
"You didn't kill any of them, though. Neither did I, for all my
talk--well, there was one guy, but.. Like I said, I get frustrated and
say things without thinking them through. It got me killed; worse, it
got you killed.  I never wanted that--not really. I know I said some
nonsense in the heat of the fight, but--"
<p>
"'Nonsense'?  I wouldn't have called it that! You were slowly killing
me until Gohan interrupted you!"
<p>
Raditz winced. "The funny thing about that," he said softly, "is that
I started breaking your ribs one at a time because I couldn't quite
bring myself to kill my own brother. Even after all my loud talk about
being a 'true warrior'.  I all but begged that green guy to take a
shot at me, to give me an excuse to stop killing you." He shook his
head. "Our Saiyan pride gives us strength, but it is just as much a
trap." He glanced significantly at Vegeta. "And it doesn't survive
hard collisions with the truth.  I left my pride in broken shards on
the floor of Hell."
<p>
He bowed his head. "There's no point in me glossing over the rotten
things I did. You know what they are, and so do I--now." He laughed
ironically. "Death.. is educational that way. But I wish you could
understand."
<p>
The tall Saiyan clenched and unclenched his fists. "You know more
about us now--you know Prince Vegeta. Can you imagine how I felt when
I found my long-lost brother--and you didn't even know who you were,
you cared nothing about our family, about our whole people, and your
tail was gone, and you didn't want to fight?  It was like someone had
taken all that was Saiyan out of you, leaving a weak and empty shell!"
<p>
Goku stood quietly, an strange look on his face. He remembered the
time Gohan had been kidnapped by Garlick Jr, and how dazed and
empty-headed he had seemed when Goku had rescued him.  It was only
intoxication from the strange fruits that grew in Garlick's orchards,
but at first Goku feared something terrible had been done to his son's
mind-- he remembered the horror that the small form he held might
not be the son he knew anymore..
<p>
"I think I understand you now," he said thoughtfully. "You wanted to
push me into showing that I was still Saiyan, that there was still a
Kakarott in there somewhere--"
<p>
"--but I couldn't think of a very good way to do it, so I tried the
first thing that popped into my head, without really thinking it
out--I should have known that you'd react, well, how I'd react if I'd
been you and you me and Gohan had been my son, and not the way I
wanted you to," finished Raditz.  "I tried to push you into fighting
me, or into killing, to get your 'Saiyan nature' back--thinking that
would bring any memories back--but I didn't think what would happen if
instead you fought like a Saiyan defending his home, his woman and his
son.  And you did, and I was the enemy -- and I got us both killed,
and I nearly got Vegeta killed and you killed again, and Nappa did get
killed--all because I turned you into an enemy instead a brother."  He
turned his face away, ashamed. "Who needs Frieza? I damn near did a
clean sweep of the last of us myself."
<p>
"I've learned a lot since then about what it is to be Saiyan," said
Goku thoughtfully.  He glanced over at Vegeta, who was still talking
to Nappa. "I'm not like you or Vegeta, and I never will be, but I've
come to understand you." He looked Raditz over. "I lied to
you, too."
<p>
"What?" Raditz was puzzled.
<p>
"I said I'd never forgive you," Goku said quietly. "That was wrong. I
forgave you long ago."  He held out his hand; Raditz took it slowly,
half-disbelieving, strange hope in his eyes. "I do have a big brother
after all."
<p>
