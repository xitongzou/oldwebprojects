Awakening the Saiyajin within
<BR>
<font size="-1" face="Times New Roman" color="white">
The first step to awakening the Saiyajin within, is to find out which Saiyajin you are most like. Like Vegeta for example. A good guy at heart, but a bad ass on the outside who shows no mercy! Or Gokou for another example, pure of heart, inside and out. Things like that. Below are several lists to help start you out with awakening the Saiyajin within! There are four lists of the most popular Saiyajins, and  how to be that Saiyajin.

Alright, if you have chosen one of the characters above your ready for the next step. The characteristics that most Saiyajins have. Some of these may not include Gokou, but rembmer Gokou grew up on Earth, and hit his head cuasing him to forget his mission. He grew up diferently then the other Saiyajins. And some of these may not include the half Saiyajins, whatever the case may be, just remember what that Saiyajin grew up as. What he went through to make him different.

<B>- Tips and Tricks -</B>

Your almost there! If you've done everything above, then you have awoken the Saiyajin within you! Or maybe you havent. This will take practice and it may be hard for some to awaken the Saiyajin Withen. If your not there yet, dont get frustrated, with a little practice you will be there! The least it shoul take is a month if you practice enough. But here is a list that may help you whether your Saiyajin within is awake or not.

-Carry a can of Blonde hair spray just in case you have to go Super Saiyajin

-Learn some form of fighting along with the Saiya-Fu which is coming up in the nest lesson
</OL>

Congratulations! If you have done all that is above then you are ready for <a href="saiyafu.html">Saiya-Fu!</A> But before you go to Saiya-Fu make sure your ready, and you have awoken the Saiyajin within! Because once the Saiyajin within is awake, it makes it much easier to learn Saiya-Fu!
