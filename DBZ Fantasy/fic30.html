Chapter 1: Oops!!</H3>

<P>"Goku, why isnt Gohan studing for his test?" You know that if he doesnt get a 100 he wont
have a chance in life!"Awww Chi Chi, give him a rest."He just fought a huge battle without 
me,or anyone for that matter.He's weary and needs to rest. "Idont care Goku." He shouldnt be 
fighting at all! Dont you know that violence doesnt solve anything anyway'' Mom shut up!
KAMEHAMEHA!!!! Gohan, do you realize what you have just done? Oh no I just killed mom! Well, 
I guess thats ok anyway,we'll wish her back with the dragonballs when we're ready. 

<P>For now lets get Vegeta and Trunks and have a big party to celebrate your 12th birthday. Ok 
dad, go ahead,but I cant get too rough. Remember that i fought that battle and that took a 
lot out of me. Gohan,why didnt you get one of us to help you with your fight?I couldnt. Why 
not? They said that if I didnt come alone they were going to kill Bulma! Vegeta jumps up and 
starts erupting,Who were they and how dare they threaten anyone less fortunate than 
themselves!Vegeta,calm down.How can i calm down when my wife's life is in danger!PUNCH! I 
vas hoping I wouldnt have to do that ,Vegeta.

<P>BOOM! What was that? WAHAHAHA! I found you Gohan! Who is that? Hes the human who I spared 
his life! Now look what happens when you are soft-hearted? GOVATIHHA! Oh no hes blown up our 
house! Well lets kick his butt! KAO-KEN X 20! KAMEHAMEHA! SWING OF ANHILATION! AARGHHHH!As I said 
Gohan I will tell you my... na.. me.... it.. is..... Pr..osp..er...eio.He seems to have died, Gohan.

<P>Well,what will we do now that he blew up the neighborhood?Good thing everyone was at church.
Sorry guys.For what?For leading him here.Im sure you didnt mean it.He still followed me here.
SO WHAT!Ok you two, quit fighting.Shut up Trunks!SLAP!SLAP!Now, lets go home.

<P>Dad where do we go?Idont know Gohan.Well ,Trunks and I have always wanted to get out of this 
city, so lets become wanderers.Yeah ,and Gohan and I have to find the dragonballs.Why do you 
have to find the dragonballs?Gohan killed Chi Chi.So?What do you mean,so!I mean dont wish her 
back.Well,that sounds good but I dont think Gohan will approve.I like that idea,dont wish her 
back.<BR><BR>
