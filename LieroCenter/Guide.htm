<p>Many of you at home follow match coverage religiously, and can rattle off lists of every popular deck type played in Standard/Extended. However, there are also a lot of players who aren't quite as proficient in scrutinizing every detail of tournament play. For players of all levels, here's a basic guide to all the different deck types that were played during the DCi sanctioned, prereleases, tournaments, Gateway and Masters of Pro Tour Nice.</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Sligh<br><b>Colors:</b> Mono-Red<br><b>Strategy:</b> Sligh revolves around efficient creatures and direct damage spells in order to kill the opponent as quickly as possible. Virtually all resources are dedicated to mounting an offense.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Ball Lightning, Jackal Pup, Fireblast</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Stompy<br><b>Colors:</b> Mono-Green<br><b>Strategy:</b> Stompy revolves around undercosted efficient creatures and power-up spells in order to kill the opponent as quickly as possible. Virtually all resources are dedicated to mounting an efficient offense and defense.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Wild Dogs, Puncing Jaguar, Call of the herd</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Ankh-Tide<br><b>Colors:</b> Mono-BLue<br><b>Strategy:</b> THis deck uses the card ankh of mishra, along with cards that return lands to the opponent's hand to formulate an efficient strategy. The opponent can't get any mana available, plus he takes damage every time a land comes into play.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Parallax tide, ankh of mishra, counterspell</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Suicide Black<br><b>Colors:</b> Mono-BLack<br><b>Strategy:</b> Suicide black gets its name from cards that take away your life in exchange for an undercosted spell. Suicide black wants to kill its opponents fast, and as long as you're above 1 life, you'll gladly exhange resources for powerful effects that can kill an opponent as early as the second turn.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Dark ritual, HAtred, Necropotence, carnophage</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> UB Tempo<br><b>Colors:</b> Black/Blue<br><b>Strategy:</b> THis deck uses tempo and card advantage to eliminate most of the opponent's threats, then drops a phyrexian scuta or morphling to win the game.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> counterspell, diabolic edict, fact or fiction, dismiss</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Squirrel Opposition<br><b>Colors:</b> Green/Blue<br><b>Strategy:</b> Squirrel Opposiiton revolves around the cards squirrel nest to generate tokens and opposition, to turn every one of those tokens into an icy manipulator and lock up the game.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Squirrel nest, opposition, counterspell</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Land Destruction<br><b>Colors:</b> Mono-Red<br><b>Strategy:</b>Land destruction just kills the opponents mana and creatures with cards like burning sands, dingus egg and aether flash. No creatures mean that this deck has an advantage over decks like mono-black control.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> burning sands, aether flash, dingus egg</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Miracle Gro/Super Gro<br><b>Colors:</b> Miracle Gro-Green/Blue. Super Gro-Green/Blue/White<br><b>Strategy:</b> Miracle Gro and Super Gro both operate on the same principal. Each wants to get a Quirion Dryad into play as quickly as possible, and use cheap cantrips and countermagic in order to make it grow into a huge monster. Miracle Gro runs a very small number of lands (10 usually), which are supplemented by all the one and two casting cost search effects. Super Gro plays more land, and adds white to utilize the threshold enabled Mystic Enforcer, as well as the efficient removal spell Swords to Plowshares.<br><b>Key Cards (Miracle Gro):</b> Quirion Dryad, Sleight of Hand, Werebear, Force of Will<br><b>Key Cards (Super Gro):</b> Same as above, plus Mystic Enforcer, Meddling Mage and Swords to Plowshares</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Oath of Druids<br><b>Colors:</b> Green/Blue<br><b>Strategy:</b> Oath of Druids abuses the enchantment of the same name by getting its creatures into play for no mana. Once an opponent plays a creature, the Oath player searches for one of their own (traditionally Morphling, Spike Feeder or Spike Weaver). Then, if a Gaea's Blessing is revealed during the Oath process, the entire graveyard is reshuffled into the Oath player's deck, keeping them from running out of cards and allowing them to repeat the process. The new oath of druids uses cognivore and a variety of instants to win the game.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Oath of Druids, Gaea's Blessing, Accumulated Knowledge</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> PT Junk<br><b>Colors:</b> Green/White/Black<br><b>Strategy:</b> A utility deck, PT Junk plays both offense and defense. Utilizing a very efficient creature base (usually including River Boa, Spectral Lynx, Spiritmonger and Mystic Enforcer), Junk packs a bit of discard combined with a bit of removal for creatures, enchantments and lands. Junk usually has an answer for everything, though each answer comes in small quantities.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Duress, Swords to Plowshares, Seal of Cleansing, River Boa</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Reanimator<br><b>Colors:</b> black-red<br><b>Strategy:</b> Reanimator  drops huge creatures into your graveyard via buried alive or entomb, then uses reanimate or zombify to bring it back into play, usually on the second or third turn!. The additon of anger and mountains makes sure that your creatures have haste as well!<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Anger, Phantom Nishoba, Verdant force, Buried alive</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Braids-cemetary<br><b>Colors:</b> mono-Black<br><b>Strategy:</b> Braids uses a lot of sacrifice cards and cards that give you stuff when they go to the graveyard. The deck revolves around braids, cabal minion and oversold cemetary to bring back your creatures. your opponent will still have to sacrifice each turn however, while you make sacrifical tokens with bredding pit.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Breeding pit, oversold cemetary, braids, cabal minion, sengir autocrat, grave pact</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Sliver<br><b>Colors:</b> All five colors<br><b>Strategy:</b> Silver uses sliver creatures which pump each other up to gradually win the game.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Sliver queen, muscle sliver, winged sliver</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Enchantress<br><b>Colors:</b> Green-white<br><b>Strategy:</b> Enchantress uses the argothian enhantress to draw a card for each enchantment you play, along with cheap-casting rancor and the auratog win condition to overwhelm your opponent. while rancor only costs a measly G and goes back to your hand every time it's being sacrificed to auratog plus you draw a card from the enchantress each time, the card advantage is enormous.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Rancor, argothian enchantress, auratog, ancestral mask</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Goblin Bidding<br><b>Colors:</b> black-red<br><b>Strategy:</b> Goblin bidding uses the infamous combo of efficient cheap goblins along with patriarch's bidding to bring them all back at once. anger makes it so that all your goblins have haste too.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> PAtriarch's bidding, goblin piledriver, anger</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Goblin Sligh<br><b>Colors:</b> Mono-red<br><b>Strategy:</b> goblin sligh uses aggressive goblins and burn to finish off the opponent very fast. sometimes this deck can even win with a turn 3 kill!<br><b>Key Cards:</b> DGoblin warchief, seige-gang commander, goblin lackey, goblin piledriver</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> REbels<br><b>Colors:</b> Mono-white<br><b>Strategy:</b> Rebels is a commonly played deck type that uses tons of rebels and search cards to bring out an overwhelming force of weenies.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> ramosian seargent, lin sivvi, defiant hero, defiant falcon</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> White Weenie<br><b>Colors:</b> Mono-white<br><b>Strategy:</b> White Weenie is a commonly played deck type with a single goal in mind: overwhelm your opponent. White weenie can bring out a mass of efficient creatures in a single turn.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Mother of runes, savannah lions, silver knight, white knight</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> UW Control/millstone<br><b>Colors:</b> blue-white<br><b>Strategy:</b> White-blue control uses cards like blinding angel and millstone as the win condition. MAss-removal, counters and card-drawing provide numerous ways to deal with the opponent.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Wrath of god, counterspell, absorb, fact or fiction</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Mono-black control<br><b>Colors:</b> Mono-black<br><b>Strategy:</b> Mono-black control have very few creatures but numerous ways to deal with the opponent's creatures. Mono-black control is best against creature decks and with cabal coffers and mirari, can bring out a staggering amount of mana in the late game.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Cabal Coffers, Chainer's edict, corrupt, mind sludge</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> The Rock<br><b>Colors:</b> black-green<br><b>Strategy:</b> The rock uses a variety of efficient spells to slowly kill the opponent. green's creatures backed up by black's discard and removal provide a great strategy.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Spiritmonger, pernicious deed, diabolic edict, duress</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> U/G Madness<br><b>Colors:</b> green-blue<br><b>Strategy:</b> U/G madness uses card-filtering and discard to fuel the unbeatable madness engine. first turn plays like free basking rootwallas and instant arrogant wurms can pound the opponent into submission.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Basking rootwalla, wild mongrel, arrogant wurm, merfolk looter</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> G/R Fires/Beats<br><b>Colors:</b> green-red<br><b>Strategy:</b> Green-Red has a very aggressive strategy using cards like fires of yavimaya, sparoling burst and call of the herd to deal a massive amount of damage in a small amonut of time. Green's efficient creatures backed up by burn provide a strategy that is hard to beat.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Call of the herd, blastoderm, fires of yavimaya, incinerate</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Tinker<br><b>Colors:</b> Mono-blue<br><b>Strategy:</b> Probably the fastest deck overall, tinker uses artifacts to gain a massive amount of mana, then uses stroke of genius to deck the opponent. An alternate win strategy is provided by masticore and/or phyrexian processor.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Tinker, Grim Monolith, Voltaic Key, Metalworker</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Wake<br><b>Colors:</b> Green-blue-white<br><b>Strategy:</b> Wake has no creatures but instead has a lot of lands that comes into use with mirari's wake. with mirari's wake, massive amounts of mana can be generated and the win through cunning wish or decree of justice. Global removal and moment's peace along with counterspells supports that strategy.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Wrath of god, Mirari's wake, decree of justice, moment's peace</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> RUG<br><b>Colors:</b> Red-green-blue<br><b>Strategy:</b> This deck uses the most efficient and tier 1 cards of each color to bring about devastation to the opponent. 2-for-1 cards like mystic snake, prophetic bolt and flametongue kavu gives you great card advantage.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Counterspell, Mystic snake, flametongue kavu, call of the herd</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Replenish<br><b>Colors:</b> white-blue<br><b>Strategy:</b> Replenish is a deck that drops a lot of enchantments in the graveyard, replenishes them into play, then uses opalescence to pound the opponent.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Counterspell, opalescence, attunement, replenish</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Domain<br><b>Colors:</b> all five colors<br><b>Strategy:</b> Domian uses all five colors and uses cards that gain you an advantage of having all those colors to win the game.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Tribal flame, allied strategies, quiron dryad</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Angry Hermit REcursion<br><b>Colors:</b> Green/Black<br><b>Strategy:</b> A favorite of players from Your Move Games, the Hermit Druid deck uses its namesake creature to fill the graveyard with recursion creatures. After there are several copies of Ashen Ghoul, Squee, and Krovikan Horror milled to the graveyard, the Hermit Druid player enjoys a massive card advantage as practically all of his creatures return to hand or to play for free! On top of this, these same creatures usually end up back in the HDR player's hand after they are killed, making this deck nearly unstoppable given a long game.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Hermit Druid, Ashen Ghoul, Krovikan Horror</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> BUG<br><b>Colors:</b> Black/Blue/Green<br><b>Strategy:</b> BUG (named after its colors) uses huge efficient spells for big effects, virtually ignoring finesse. While most of the cards BUG uses are the most efficient possible, they don't have particularly the greatest synergy. BUG wins by going for the big play, and hoping that playing with the best cards in the format will equal winning big, even if they don't work well together.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Call of the Herd, Pernicious Deed, Spiritmonger, Counterspell</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Aluren Combo<br><b>Colors:</b> Green/Black/Blue/White<br><b>Strategy:</b> This decks revolves around the card Aluren. Once is in play, all the creatures in this deck can be played for free. Raven Familiars draws a card each time it enters play, and Cavern Harpy allows the Aluren player to replay the Familiar over and over again for the cost of only one life. Eventually the Aluren player draws their entire deck, plays a horde of creatures, and wins the following turn.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Aluren, Cavern Harpy, Raven Familiar</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> 3 Deuce<br><b>Colors:</b> Green/White/Red<br><b>Strategy:</b> 3 Deuce uses many of the same creatures found in PT Junk, but swaps the strategy of black discard and creatures for red removal and sideboard cards. With all the blue decks prevalent in this format, the added sideboard versatility of Pyroblast gives a slight boost to the power of this deck.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> River Boa, Swords to Plowshares, Mogg Fanatic, Pyroblast</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Turboland<br><b>Colors:</b> Green/Blue<br><b>Strategy:</b> Turboland casts Exploration to play multiple lands a turn, and uses Horn of Greed to draw a card off of each land played. After the Turboland player gets a massive amount of lands in play and cards in hand, they start casting an infinite recursion of Time Warps combined with Gaea's Blessing. Turboland also borrows the Oath of Druids engine, but doesn't usually use it to win, instead to buy time and use Gaea's Blessing to recycle the cards in the graveyard.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Horn of Green, Timewarp, Exploration, Gush</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Psychatog<br><b>Colors:</b> Black/Blue<br><b>Strategy:</b> Psychatog won a number of regional tournaments last month. It uses its namesake creature to attack for a large amount of damage, using countermagic and bounce to keep the board clear. Psychatog is considered more of a deck for Type 2 than Extended, however, and doesn't gain a lot of tools in the transition from one format to the other. The most popular win condition is through psychatog-upheaval which you cast an upheaval with 3 mana floating to cast a psychatog on the same turn. the psycatog will almost be guaranteed to kill the opponent next turn.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Psychatog, Upheaval, Fact or Fiction</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Stasis<br><b>Colors:</b> Mono-Blue<br><b>Strategy:</b> Painstakingly slow, Stasis is perhaps the most frustrating deck to play against in Extended. It uses the enchantment Stasis to keep anything from untapping, and plays an overabundance of Island main deck to make sure the Stasis gets fuelled as long as possible. Then, the Stasis player drops Claws of Gix to kill their own Stasis at the end of their opponent's turn, allowing the Stasis player themselves to untap. Then, a second Stasis is usually played along with a Morphling, which can untap itself and attack for the win over a course of several turns. <br><b>Key Cards:</b> Stasis, Morphling, Claws of Gix</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Benzo<br><b>Colors:</b> Mono-Black<br><b>Strategy:</b> This deck debuted at Pro Tour New Orleans 2001. It capitalized on the power of Entomb from <i>Odyssey</i>, which allowed it to selectively throw a huge creature (usually a verdant force or nether spirit) into the graveyard on turn one, allowing for recursion with Exhume or Reanimate on turn two. Barring an opening hand Entomb, Benzo can play Zombine Infestation to pitch creatures to the same effect, netting a 2/2 zombie for its efforts. BEnzo also uses hand disruption and tutors to backup its strategy.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Entomb, Duress, Reanimate, Vampiric tutor</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Black/White Control<br><b>Colors:</b> Black/White<br><b>Strategy:</b> This deck was developed based around the high-placing mono-black decks from Pro Tour Osaka. It basically takes those decks, adds in some Extended legal removal, and changes the win condition from Nantuko Shade to Death Grasp.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Death Grasp, Cabal Coffers, Diabolic Edict, Chainer's Edict</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Green/Blue Threshold<br><b>Colors:</b> Green/Blue<br><b>Strategy:</b> Green/Blue Threshold replicates Green-blue madness and uses its graveyard-filling cards to pump up its mana-efficient creatures.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Wild Mongrel, Werebear, Wonder</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Elves!<br><b>Colors:</b> Mono-Green<br><b>Strategy:</b> Almost every non-land card in this deck is an elf, excepting the Elf enhancing Elvish Champion and the artifact Coat of Arms. These two cards enhance the super-mana accelerating Elf army, allowing for a single-minded strategy of overrun and destroy.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Gaea's Cradle, Priest of Titania, Elvish Champion, Coat of Arms</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Finkula Go<br><b>Colors:</b> Black/Blue<br><b>Strategy:</b> Originally there was a deck called Forbidian, which used the card-drawing Ophidian combined with the reusable counterspell Forbid to lock down the board. Finkula go uses meddling mage to shut down the opponent, who was created by chris pikula, and the upgraded Ophidian (Shadowmage Infiltrator), which was designed by tournament champion Jon Finkel, hence the name of the deck. <br><b>Key Cards:</b> Shadowmage Infiltrator, Forbid, Counterspell, meddling mage</p>
<p><b>Deck Name:</b> Draw-Go<br><b>Colors:</b> Mono-Blue<br><b>Strategy:</b> Draw-Go tries to counter every spell the opponent plays, and then win with Morphling. A very single minded gambit.<br><b>Key Cards:</b> Morphling, Counterspell, Force of Will</p>
