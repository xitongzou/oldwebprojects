digging and another regarding roping. These should prove helpful to level newbie
to average player.</h3><br>

<br>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">Digging
is one of, if not the most important abilities in Liero. Most of the Liero
terrains are enclosed and you cannot get around without digging (unless you blow
your way through with a weapon but that's another story).<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">To
basic dig, hold the direction you would like to move (left or right) [point A]
and rapidly press the opposite direction [point B] to dig the way that you are
holding. Confused yet? Here's an example.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">You
would like to dig left. Hold left and rapidly press right. [hold &lt; +
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;]<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">Simple
enough. So you can dig left and right but you still need to dig up. Simple. Aim
downward and rapidly press both directions.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">To
dig downward, aim downward and rapidly press left and right.

the hardest part of digging is digging upwards. The reason why is because you
can't. The maximum you can dig is 45 degrees that is approximately this
equivalent to this: /. However there is a way to get up but it is extremely
difficult. First, dig upward, the allotted 45 degrees, then jump up the opposite
direction and dig upward. You should have created a small hole that you will be
able to just climb into and continue digging that way. Continue this pattern and
you should be able to get to your high destination.</span>

<font size="3" color="#00FFFF"><a name="#roping"></a>Roping</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">Roping
is very essential tool in a Liero terrain where it is very open and also when
you need to reach high parts that are virtually impossible to reach otherwise.
To initiate the rope, hold the weapon select button and then press jump.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">What
you are supposed to do is aim where you would like to attach your rope to, then
hold the weapon select button and press jump. If the terrain you are aiming for
is out of the rope's length and reach, the rope will automatically fall until it
finds a nearby piece of land to attach itself to. If it finds no land, it will
automatically attach itself to the ground.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">While
hanging on the rope, you have many options. You can hang up their and drop
weapons, continuously rope around as transportation or to avoid being hit by
your enemy or use it to reach an out of reach destination. If you are trying to
use it as transportation or to avoid your enemy's weapons, aim to where you want
to shoot it, hold the weapon select button, then press jump. Now you are hanging
in the air on the rope. Now, re-aim where you want to shoot the next shot and
press the jump button. Now, re aim where you want to the next shot and press the
jump button, etc.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">Now
that you know how to multiple rope around the terrain, you need to reach a part
of the terrain which is virtually impossible to reach any other way. Aim near
the approximate area of where it is. Now once you have it in sight, aim at the
ceiling right above where you want to go or aim at the ground of your
destination. Press the jump button. Once you've reached your destination, you
can go ahead and let go of the weapon select button to end your roping session.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">I
bet you think you know everything there is to know about roping, right? Wrong.
Although there is an entire world of roping styles, objectives and play, these
are the absolute basics and necessities of roping. To end the tutorial, you will
learn how to drop weapons onto unsuspecting victims below, behind or above. If
your enemy is somewhere below you, chose a weapon a nuke like weapon (Mini Nuke,
Big Nuke, etc.) or a Spikeball type weapon. Now aim downward and press fire.
Hopefully, if your aim was correct, your enemy has been injured. Next, to aim at
your enemy who is on the terrain near you or roping beside you. You may want to
choose a Flamer if he's very close to you or a Minigun type weapon if he's
further. You can aim your weapon in his general direction and press fire and
he'll be blown to bits. Finally, if your enemy is above you, you can either
choose a Minigun type weapon or a Nuke type weapon. Aim upward and fire your
weapon at him. Hopefully he'll be falling to his bloody death.<o:p>

helpful roping uses are attaching yourself to your enemy who's on a rope where
you aim at your enemy's body and try and attach yourself to him. Wherever he
goes, you will follow unless you drop your connection to the rope. You can also
fire a weapon to break the terrain that your enemy's rope is attached to sending
him and his rope plummeting to the ground. There are many uses for the rope, see
if you can find your own.</span>
