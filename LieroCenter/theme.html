<h3 align="center">Here's my Campaign Archive(Theme packs):</h3>
<table border="1">
<p align=center>These are "Theme Packs", which one way or another,
alter more than one aspect of the Liero game to create a whole new 
theme. These are more fun to try out but usually more complicated to get 
running.<br>Because many Theme Packs are different, each description
will let you know how the packages come and what will be required
(if anything).<br>
To open these files, you need <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/d20/darkflare/winzip81.exe">Winzip</a>.<br><br>

<td width=80%>I've never played Quake (No jeers, please), but I can tell a bad theme pack when I see
one. As much hype as Quake has, I'd say this mod doesn't do it justice. All I could get was 2
weapons, Axe and Broomstick (What kind of weapons are those?) to show up, though I heard there were others...
the sounds don't seem like anyting special. It somes with 1 level in a volcano area. By blakkie<br>
