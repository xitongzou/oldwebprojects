Throughout the year, UT FOCUS is host to a number of <b>VOLUNTEERING</b> and <b>FUNDRAISING</b> programs designed to benefit pre-selected non-profit organizations in Toronto and the GTA.  The events anticipated for the upcoming year will consist of both single-day events and events that run the span of the entire academic year.  
<br />
<br />
Both the volunteering and fundraising events have been planned to incorporate a multitude of charitable organizations, ranging from volunteer work that will help assist children in low-income neighbourhoods, to feeding the homeless and working with the elderly.  
<br />
<br />
Of equal importance, UT FOCUS acknowledges the generous support from its members and sponsors, and in recognition of the contributions, hosts a variety of <b>SOCIALS</b> that are meant to treat our supporters to some fun and entertainment. 
<br />

<i>*Please note - that all proceeds accumulated at any event, will be entirely donated to a charitable beneficiary. </i>
