The University of Toronto Federation of Charitable University Students (UTF or UT FOCUS) is a non-profit, student based charity organization.  UTF maintains three primary objectives:<br />

<ol style="list-style:lower-roman;">
<li>To create and promote awareness of individuals who are less fortunate than ourselves</li>
<li>Encourage students to proactively give back to their communities, through participation in social, volunteering and fundraising events</li>
<li>To promote a healthy campus life, through a balance of social and charitable events</li>
</ol>
UTF has maintained proud partnerships with many prominent non-profit organizations such as the Toronto Raptors Foundation, Toronto Kiwanis Boys and Girls Clubs, and the Scott mission, to name but a few.  Our organization is headed by a strong executive committee, each dedicated to improving the lives of those encumbered by adversity.  <br />

<ul>
<li>UTF exists as part of a larger organization, recognized as Asian FOCUS (AF), and is but one chapter of the six universities that are distinguished by AF.  (For more information, please visit <a class="charitylink" target="_blank" href="http://www.asianfocus.org/">www.asianfocus.org</a>)<br /><br />
</li>
<li>
Although UTF shares the same goals and initiatives that the entire AF organization endorses, our executive committee is determined to create a more unified and inclusive federation at UT this year - our distinction as UTF rather than AF comes from the hope to promote a more diversified ethnic membership base, such that our group does not selectively include or exclude any persons over another.  (For more information, see our FAQ ** COMING SOON ** section.)
