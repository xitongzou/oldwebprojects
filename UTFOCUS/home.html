THANKS EVERYONE!
<br /><br />
Once again, the entire UTF executive committee would like to give thanks to everyone who managed to make it out this past Saturday (15th), for our orientation party held at O'grady's Tap and Grill. 
<br /><br />
We hoped that everyone enjoyed themselves, despite some minor difficulties at the beginning of the event, and that everyone had a chance to get to know other members as well as our executive committee!  
<br /><br />
To those who were unable to make it out, we hope you'll drop by our next event this coming Saturday 22nd, 2007 at Ashbridges Bay (**check back for more details) for some more fun and games and FOOD!  We'd also love to see all those who we met at our first party at O'grady's - so feel free to bring your friends and come on out THIS SATURDAY!  
<br /><br />
