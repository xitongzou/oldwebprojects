<p>John Lau International School of Taekwon-Do was founded in   1984. The school is an internationally recognized Taekwon-Do training   centre where students are taught by a certified international instructor in a   5,000 square feet indoor air-conditioned facility. With school rules and a   well-developed training system, students will discover their hidden potential   and will be able to develop it to the fullest extent. With 30 years of teaching   experience, Master Lau fully understands the importance of an instructor's role   in the development of a student's self-displine and self-cultivation. A clean,   safe and comfortable environment is also an imprtant component to this growth   Many parents have come to improve discipline, self-confidence as well as   physique, and the truth is that we can filfill and satisfy these wishes.  John's Tae Kown Do School is proudly the Title Sponsor for UT FOCUS 2007-2008.
