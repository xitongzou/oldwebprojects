  <a class="charitylink" target="_blank" href="http://www.scottmission.com/">http://www.sickkids.ca</a><br />
The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), affiliated with the University of   Toronto, is Canada's most research-intensive hospital and the largest centre   dedicated to improving children's health in the country. As innovators in child   health, SickKids improves the health of children by integrating care, research   and teaching. </p>
<p><b>Salvation Army </b><br />
  <a class="charitylink" target="_blank" href="http://www.scottmission.com/">http://www.salvationarmy.ca</a></p>
<p>The Salvation Army was founded in Canada in 1882, just fifteen years after   Confederation. From the beginning, the Army&rsquo;s goal was simple &ndash; to provide   spiritual and practical support to society&rsquo;s most vulnerable. Among various   service innovations, The Salvation Army was instrumental, in its early years, in   developing the first prisoner parole system and the first Juvenile Detention   facility in Canada. The Army was also an early provider of shelter and service   to women in crisis and served alongside the Canadian Armed Forces during the   Great War and World War II. The Salvation Army continues its critical work to   this day, giving direct, compassionate, hands-on service to 1.5 million people   each year and restoring hope and dignity to those who might otherwise remain   invisible in society<br />
