<h3>.hack//sign Review (reviewed by animenfo.com)</h3><br><br>
<p> first became interested in this story because its name was so ubiquitous when I was first getting into the anime scene. The premise for the story seemed fairly interesting (person trapped in MMORPG) so after I figured out how to get my hands on the series, I eagerly downloaded and watched...

Well, I'll also confirm the slow pacing of the story. It took quite a while before I had any real interest in the direction of the story or the characters. There seemed to be a lot of character background when I didn't really care at all .. the character building was somewhat weak as well, and like it's been said - people just don't take themselves that seriously in games ... unless, of course, you're Tsukasa and trapped inside it.

You have to give the creators credit for originality with the storyline though, even if the characters were not unforgettable. Still, there was a lot more they could have done with it - explaining more about Macha or Aura or even the game designer's wishes... though I suppose that is in .hack//Dusk and .hack//Liminality, I wouldn't know. One of my peeves was that there was a little too much cutting between characters staring at each other without saying anything.

The music, while somehow hauntingly memorable (namely: A Stray Child, Aura, Fake Wings, The World and Key of the Twilight.) always stuck out. A good soundtrack should add emotion and atmosphere to a scene without being blatantly obvious. Sora's theme always seemed a bit too different. Oh yeah, and what happened to Sora at the end of the series?

The scenery and character designs were good, however. Out of all of the series' components, they probably stand out the most. Seeing the sets was a big factor that drew me in initally.

Overall I was unsatisfied with the ending. I thought the series could have spent less time being vague with clues earlier, and spent more time developing the ending. The episode about Mimiru's "mentor" was really out of place at the very end, and the recap episode was pointless. The series was enjoyable enough as a distraction one time through. This is the first series I've watched in a batch since Fullmetal Alchemist, which outdoes .hack//sign in complexity, character depth, meaning, story and overall appeal by far ... So, don't expect too much of this show. It's mildly interesting if you can stand slow moving plots and vague explanations.
I sort of recommend this series - After all, I think we should all give in, stop being critics, and just let ourselves enjoy a show once in a while. <p>
