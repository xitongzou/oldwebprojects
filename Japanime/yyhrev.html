<h3>Yu Yu Hakusho Review (reviewed by animetric.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>The character development is what made this series so special for me. Yusuke becomes great friends with his rival Kuwabara, who has much honor -- he hates losing and likes to fight alone. Yusuke is later joined by two powerful demons -- Kurama and Hiei. Kurama is a demon in the form of a human whose true powers are brought out when he is in his real form. Hiei is an incredibly powerful and fast demon who seems to be unbearably bitter at first, but as the series progresses we learn of his tragic past. 

One thing that I must mention is the villains. There are points in this show when I liked the villains better than the heroes. The reason for this being the fact that they have a great deal of development. One villain in particular is Toguro, my personal favorite. He may seem very mean and nasty at first but at the end of the second saga I understood him as did Yusuke and the other characters. Rather than the saga ending with the celebration of his defeat, Yusuke looked at him and smiled and said goodbye as if he were saying it to a close friend. The fights in this show won’t try your patience like Dragon Ball Z. There’s always a reason behind the fighting, and most of the time the universe isn’t facing impending doom (cough, cough, DBZ). The villains always have something significant behind their actions. 

The art and animation start off fairly crappy, but as each episode pasees the animation also improves. Some episodes contain a lot of eye candy, in the way of fighting and action scenes. Regardless the animation is better than that of DBZ’s; it’s also much more gory. What makes the fight scenes better than DBZ’s is how you see fists making contact and the way the camera angles twist and zoom about. Rarely will you see people punching and kicking so fast that all you see are speed lines a la DBZ. 

Overall, I'd say it is the best fighting anime I’ve seen. Before this, DBZ was my favorite but this show made me realize what else is out there.
