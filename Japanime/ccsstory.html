Card Captor is about a 4th grader named Sakura who unlocks a mystical book in the basement of her house. Upon opening it, she unleashes the cards locked within: the Clow cards. These cards are kept in a book called the Clow Book. By unlocking the book, she also awakens the Sun Guardian of the book, Keroberos (or Kero, as he is come to be called). He is a little stuffed animal because his power is locked within the 4 most powerful cards, the Element Cards. With the help of Kero, Tomoyo, her best friend and second cousin, and Li Syaoran, a decendant from Clow and also Sakura's rival in the beginning, Sakura must capture and seal the cards with her clow key before the cards wreak havoc all over the world.
