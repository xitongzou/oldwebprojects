<p><strong>Cardcaptor Sakura: The Movie </strong></p>
<p>
  
 
 In the first feature based on the popular series, Sakura wins a trip to Hong Kong. Her father is away on business, so she goes with Toya, Yukito, and Tomoyo. Hong Kong is the home of her classmate and sometime ally Li Shaoran and his obnoxious cousin Meilin, and the cast is soon reunited. Clow Reed, the wizard who invented the magical Clow Cards, also lived in Hong Kong, and his presence lingers there in the memory of the redoubtable sorceress Madoushi. Although Li Shaoran, his beautiful mother, and Kero offer their assistance, Sakura uses her inner resources to defeat Madoushi, a more powerful and evil foe than any of the Cards. This longer adventure preserves the qualities that have won the series so many fans, and it's more entertaining in the subtitled Japanese version than in the clunky English dub. Unrated; suitable for ages 9 and up: Violence. <em>--Charles Solomon </em><p><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005V9HE/qid=1130993615/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3_3/702-3928691-1361631">Buy It </a>
<p><strong>Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card</strong>
<p> Sakura Kinomoto has come a long way since first being chosen to be a cardcaptor. She's captured all the cards, made new friends and gained some insight into her own heart. Now, she faces her ultimate challenge, finding the strength to confess her feelings to her true love. While struggling with her heart, a mysterious force has begun stealing her cards and threatens to take away what she truly cherishes. Can Sakura find the inner strength she needs to take on this final challenge?
<p><strong>Editorial Overview: </strong>
<p> <a name="b0000c8arj7605"></a>Four months after the end of the broadcast series, Sakura and her friends are starting 6th grade; Toya and Yuki are college freshmen. The magical Clow Cards have been captured, but Shaoran Li has returned to Hong Kong, and Sakura has yet to respond to his declaration of love. Tomoyo arranges for him and Meilin to visit for the opening of an amusement park on the site of Eriol's house. The bulldozers free an unknown 53rd Card, which promptly causes problems. In a plot that recalls <em>Tenchi in Tokyo </em>, the Card wrecks havoc not out of malice, but because of the loneliness it endured while it was sealed away. Sakura manages to resolve everything satisfactorily--with some help from her friends. The English vocal cast is better than the one for <em>Cardcaptors </em>, but the film is more entertaining in Japanese with subtitles. (Rated 13 and older: minor violence) <em>--Charles Solomon </em>
