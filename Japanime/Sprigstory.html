  <strong>Spriggan </strong> is another sci-fi action thriller that combines brilliant action scenes with an average story. Somewhere in Turkey, Noah's Ark was discovered by some scientists group but mysteriously the whole expedition was annihilated. This brings the attention of various groups including the Arcam who has a caring for civilization contacts they sent <strong>Spriggan </strong> (special agents with high physical and psychological abilities) to see things there. The plot development is okay, I guess, but was not as fast in happening as the action sequences. From the first scene of action, I thought, wow, the producers have really succeeded in giving this movie a distinct look with high frame right scenes and innovative camera angles. 
<p><strong>Editorial Overview:</strong>
<p> Fast paced, violent, and loud, <em>Spriggan </em> uses a combination of drawn and computer animation to deliver the kind of slam-bang thrill ride <em>Final Fantasy </em> only promised. The convoluted plot, based on a <em>manga </em> series by Hirotsugu Kawasaki and Yasutaka Ito, mixes elements from <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark </em>, <em>2001: A Space Odyssey </em>, <em>Akira </em>, and <em>Universal Soldier </em>. Yu Ominae (voice by Christopher Patton) is a Spriggan, a member of an elite corps of biologically engineered warriors created by the secret organization ARCAM, who finds himself involved in a baroque adventure centered on the newly discovered Ark of Noah. The Ark is actually an extraterrestrial vehicle with the power to alter the Earth's climate and spawn new animal species. A sinister cadre of rogue Pentagon generals wants it and dispatches a corps of murderous cyborgs lead by Col. MacDougall (Kevin Corn), a monstrous child who's also the product of biological experiments, to capture it. ARCAM is determined to prevent the generals from gaining control of the Ark's awesome powers. Yu battles his way to victory through car chases, sword fights, shootouts, explosions, knifings, and psychic blasts, with a little help from fellow-Spriggan Jean-Jacques Mondo (Andy McAvin). Director Hirotsugu Kawasaki handles the action sequences more effectively than the minimal character development, and Katsuhiro Otomo's screenplay doesn't always make a lot of sense. But <em>Spriggan </em> supplies what hard-core action fans sought in vain in many recent Hollywood blockbusters. Just don't sit too close to a speaker. MPAA rated R, under 17 not admitted (for considerable violence). <em>--Charles Solomon </em><br>
