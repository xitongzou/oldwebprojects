<p><strong>Escaflowne: Girl from Gaea </strong></p>
<p>
  
 Lost and alone, Hitomi Kanzaki is looking for something to believe in. As the world seems to close in around her, she simply wishes to fade away. Hitomi's heart finds resonance with another and she suddenly finds herself on another world called Gaea. There, she is the Wing Goddess, able to call forth the ancient armor, Escaflowne. <br>
 <br>
Thrust into the heart of conflict, Hitomi meets Van, a young man who has also lost hope for the future. Together, they must overcome their inner feelings and fight against the destroyers of Van's clan. As the Wing Goddess, Hitomi finds that she alone holds the fate of Gaea, either its freedom, or its ultimate destruction.

<p><strong>Editorial Overview:</strong>
<p>  <a name="b0009wfele4610">In this anime feature based on the popular Japanese television series, Hitomi is a high school student who is trying to come to terms with a severe case of depression. When her spirits are at their lowest, Hitomi makes a psychic connection with Van, the young king of the nation of Gaia, located on another planet visible in the night sky of Earth. Gaia has been brought to the brink of war by the evil Black Dragon Clan, and, while the nearby nation of Abaharaki wishes to form an alliance with Gaia for their mutual protection, Van is a leader who prefers to act on his own. Hitomi finds herself transported to Gaia, where she becomes a valuable if unlikely ally to Van; as the Black Dragon Clan advances, Van discovers that Hitomi may hold the key to the magical dragon armor of Escaflowne, the weapon that would make Gaia invincible. Escaflowne (also advertised as Escaflowne the Movie: A Girl in Gaia) features Kelly Sheridan as the voice of Hitomi; the voice cast for the American release version also includes Kirby Morrow, Brian Drummond, and Paul Dobson. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide </a><br>
