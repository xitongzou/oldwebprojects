150 years ago, at the end of the Edo Period, the legendary samurai known as Hitokiri Battousai has turned the tide for the people of Japan, leading them into the new Meiji Era. Swords are now outlawed, and the Battousai has dissapeared, becoming a legend to the people of Japan. The search for the Battousai begins. <br>
Kenshin Himura is a wandering samurai with a dark past... for he is also the man known as Battousai the Manslayer. Having annihilated countless people, his sword skills are second to none. His name alone is enough to strike fear into the hearts of citizens who've heard of his legendary abilities. But Kenshin is determined never to kill again, and he now uses his sword to protect people instead. As he roams Japan, he comes across the passionate Kendo instructor Kaoru Kamiya. Kaoru is immediately attracted to the wanderer, and Kenshin decides to stay for a bit to help Kaoru rebuild her father's dojo. But there are still elements beyond his control that threaten to pull him back to his blood-stained past. Can Kenshin truly leave it all behind for a peaceful and normal life?
