<h3>Sailor Moon Review (reviewed by animeast.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>I think its actually a law that if you watch any amount of anime, you have to watch a magical girl type anime at some point or another. I never got into Sailor Moon all that much except for what I caught in passing while it was played on US television. I will say that what I have seen of it, it looks to be a pretty good anime. It definately has its droves of fans, and every convention there are droves of people cosplaying it. That kind of fan devotion couldn't be achieved unless the series was either very good, or so cheesy that people love it. I'm thinking a little of both. One thing I ought to mention is if you plan on watching this, you should definately get the uncensored Japanese version...the US version is really chopped up.

<h3>Anime Rating:</h3> 8.7/10
