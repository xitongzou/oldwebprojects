About a half demon-half demon. He looks for the "Four Souled Jewel" which grants demons incredible powers. He finds out a girl named Kikyou has it and eventually, he grows feelings for her. Another person named Naruku impersonates Inuyasha and tries to steal the jewel from Kikyou. Inuyasha then thinks Kikyou is betraying him, steals the jewel and tries to escape from the village, but is nailed into a tree with a magical arrow. She then dies and is cremated with the jewel. 

Fifty-years later, a young girl named Kagome is transported into the time-period Inuyasha's in. Kikyou's younger sister, which has now aged, put a bead necklace on Inuyasha's neck, which he cannot remove. She tells Kagome to pick a word and she picks "Sit" so everytime she says it, he slams face first into the ground, and is paralyzed for a few seconds. Later on, Kagome's arrow accidentally breaks the jewel and it shatters into a million pieces. Kagome and Inuyasha then go together to find it and he, eventually develops feelings for her and is protective. 
He also can wield a sword named"Tetsusaiga" which was made from the fang of his father, a full-demon. It can only be used by a half human/half demon. It transform from a rusty old katana, and turns into the sharp fang everytimes Inuyasha uses it to protect Kagome. 
When Kagome goes back to her time period, Inuyasha doesn't do anything much and isn't as strong as when Kagome was around
