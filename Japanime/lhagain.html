<p><strong>Love Hina Again </strong></p>
<p> It's the start of a new semester at Tokyo University, and things are looking bright for Keitaro and Naru, ready to enter their first semester of college as a couple. Unfortunately, Keitaro breaks his leg before opening ceremonies even begin, and he's is forced to go home for a while. When he returns, he's accompanied by Naru's old flame Seta, who takes Keitaro with him on an archaeological dig! Someone has to run the Hina Inn, though, and Keitaro's replacement is none other than the twisted Kanoko, his maniacal sister, who has some strange ideas on how to run the place!
<p><strong>Editorial Overview: </strong>
<table>
  <tr><td valign="top"> The popular romantic comedy <em>Love Hina </em> seemed to end with the <em>Spring Special Movie </em>, when Keitaro and Naru finally got into Tokyo University--and admitted they were in love. In this new three-part adventure, Keitaro breaks his leg at the class welcoming ceremony and has to skip a semester. Keitaro got into the university to keep a childhood promise; now he needs a goal of his own. He decides to assist Mr. Seta and study archeology. While they're away on an expedition, Keitaro's stepsister Kanako arrives and makes life miserable for the whole cast. Keitaro returns and has to deal with Kanako's misplaced affection, Naru's fear of commitment, an abandoned, magical resort, the Hinato residents' well-intentioned meddling, and his own clumsiness. It all adds up to kind of affectionate nuttiness <em>Hina </em> fans expect and enjoy. (Rated 16 and older: comic violence, risqu&eacute; humor, brief nudity, tobacco and alcohol use) <em>--Charles Solomon </em>  </td></tr>
