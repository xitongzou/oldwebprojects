Chihiro, a 10-year-old girl in the midst of a move to the suburbs with her parents, wanders into a mysterious town. It's the "other world" of gods and monsters, ruled over by a witch. There, humans are changed into animals and disappear. Chihiro, who has a listless disposition, must start working at a huge bath house to survive. Can she return to her own world?
<p><strong>Editorial Overview:</strong>
<p> The highest grossing film in Japanese box-office history (more than $234 million), Hayao Miyazaki's <em>Spirited Away </em> ( <em>Sen To Chihiro Kamikakushi </em>) is a dazzling film that reasserts the power of drawn animation to create fantasy worlds. Like Dorothy in <em>The Wizard of Oz </em> and Lewis Carroll's Alice, Chihiro (voice by Daveigh Chase--Lilo in Disney's <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>) plunges into an alternate reality. On the way to their new home, the petulant adolescent and her parents find what they think is a deserted amusement park. Her parents stuff themselves until they turn into pigs, and Chihiro discovers they're trapped in a resort for traditional Japanese gods and spirits. An oddly familiar boy named Haku (Jason Marsden) instructs Chihiro to request a job from Yubaba (Suzanne Pleshette), the greedy witch who rules the spa. As she works, Chihiro's untapped qualities keep her from being corrupted by the greed that pervades Yubaba's mini-empire. In a series of fantastic adventures, she purges a river god suffering from human pollution, rescues the mysterious No-Face, and befriends Yubaba's kindly twin, Zeniba (Pleshette again). The resolve, bravery, and love Chihiro discovers within herself enable her to aid Haku and save her parents. The result is a moving and magical journey, told with consummate skill by one of the masters of contemporary animation. MPAA Rated: PG ("Some scary moments") <em>--Charles Solomon </em><br>
