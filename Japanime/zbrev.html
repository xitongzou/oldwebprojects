<h3>Gash Bell Review (reviewed by noated.net)</h3><br><br>
<p>Gash Bell is probably one of the most underrated anime currently showing. ^_^ I'm really enjoying it. 

The premise is like a hundred other anime you can think of-- where a human and a creature of one sort or another have to fight alongside each other in a tournament. In Gash Bell, the premise is that every thousand years, a multitude of demons are sent to earth to battle amongst themselves. The last one standing becomes King of the Makai. The demons are unable to fight magically themselves; they require the aid of a human bookkeeper. The Book Keeper is able to read the demon's spellbook, though not all at once. As their demon becomes stronger, more spells are unlocked and the Book Keeper is able to read them and use them. The Book Keeper must also protect their demon's book. If it becomes destroyed, the demon is sent back to the Makai in defeat. A loss or a draw does not always result in the automatic destruction of someone's book--- it is often a choice the victorious combatant has to make--- but it does sometimes happen by accident, and once a book begins to burn, there is nothing that anyone can do to put it out, no matter how dear a friend the book belongs to. Likewise, the demons are inexorably drawn together; there is little they can do to avoid the fights they are destined to have. 

Each of the demons tends to control a certain element... sound, plants, wind, ice, and so on. Others are shapeshifters, or have other unique powers. Gash is a lightning user, but has been dropped into the world as an amnesiac. A man comes across him in the forest and sends him home to his son, Kiyomaro, who lives in Japan. And the fun begins. ^_^ 

I have to honestly say, I probably laugh more with Gash Bell than any other show I'm currently watching. I love the writers' sense of humor... Gash's perpetual quest for a friend and his childish outlook on life, Suzume's fruit, Vulcan, and so on... (moge!) :o) There's an excellent cast of supporting characters to keep things interesting, and a number of high-level seiyuu cycle through as Gash's opponent of the day, so it's fun to keep your ears open and see who you catch. Gash himself is voiced by Ikue Ohtani (Merle/Escaflowne and Konohomaru/Naruto). Kiyomaro is voiced by Takahiro Sakurai (Sasame/Pretear, Fakia/Princess Tutu). But go on and spot Midorikawa Hikaru, Nobuo Tobita, Ryoutarou Okiayu, Toshihiko Seki, and others, if you can! :o) 

Even though it's a series about fighting, a lot of it is about character growth, pursuing your goals, and friendship. Even though Kiyomaro might not be as attentive to (or observant of!) Gash's needs as the viewer is, Kiyomaro is never going to let Gash down when it matters, and vice versa. Likewise, Kiyomaro is a stuck-up loner before Gash comes into his life, but Gash helps draw out his human qualities. And, after Gash discovers what he's here for, he has to make the decision as to whether or not this is something he seriously wants to pursue. Both sacrifices and decisions are made, and Gash and Kiyomaro are obligated to stick it out until the end. It's fun watching both characters grow stronger, in many different ways. 

A-E is currently doing an excellent job subbing it. At the moment, it's up to ep. 32. A movie is scheduled for release in Japan this summer. 

If you're looking for something kind of different and funny, give Gash a try. :o) The only thing that might be a bit ehhh for people is that Gash tends to be a little streaker on occasion, and some of it is right off the bat. ^_^;;;; But he quickly discovers the value of underwear, much to the viewers' relief.
I sort of recommend this series - After all, I think we should all give in, stop being critics, and just let ourselves enjoy a show once in a while. <p>
