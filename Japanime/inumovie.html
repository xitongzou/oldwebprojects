<p><strong>1. Affections Touching Across Time </strong></p>
<p> Inu Yasha: The Movie - Affections Touching Across is a feature length spinoff from the television series Inu Yasha. The son of a deadly beast that was banished centuries before by Inu Yasha's father has absorbed the energy of his father, and now seeks to take over the world and get revenge against the progeny of the person who stopped the father. The brave daughter must team with her friends to stop the deadly creature. ~ Perry Seibert, All Movie Guide

<p><strong>2. The Castle Beyond the Looking Glass</strong>
<p> Like the first <em>Inu-Yasha </em> feature, <em>Affections Touching Across Time </em>, <em>The Castle Beyond the Looking Glass </em> pits the regular cast against a new foe: Kaguya, who claims to be the legendary Moon Princess. Series creator Rumiko Takahashi mixes Eastern and Western elements in this supernatural tale: Kaguya's symbol is the pentangle or pentagram, associated with witchcraft in Europe. Like the Princess in the Japanese fable "The Tale of the Bamboo-Cutter" (also called "The Maiden from the Sky"), Kaguya demands bizarre magical objects, which Kanna and Kagura fetch. The supernatural battles don't prevent Kagome and Inu-Yasha from squabbling or Miroku from making yet another ill-considered pass at Sango. Ultimately, the unacknowledged love they share enables Kagome and Inu-Yasha to defeat Kagura, and their warm moments recall the unexpected gentleness of the OVA "The Two Akanes: 'Ranma, Look at Me!'" from Takahashi's most famous creation, <em>Ranma 1/2 </em>. (Unrated, suitable for ages 13 and older: violence, grotesque imagery, brief nudity, alcohol use) <em>--Charles Solomon </em>

<p><strong>3. Swords of An Honorable Ruler</strong>
<p> <em>Swords of an Honorable Ruler </em> is darker and more dramatic than the two previous <em>Inu-Yasha </em> features--or the broadcast series. Inu-Yasha's father Inu no Taisho, the Great Dog Demon, possessed not two but three swords: Tetsusaiga, Tenseiga, and Sounga, which are linked to Earth, Heaven, and Hell, respectively. After the human princess Izayoi gave birth to Inu-Yasha, she was killed by Takemaru, a samurai who loved her from afar. Inu no Taisho died soon after; the sword smith Totosai and Myoga the flea hid the first two swords, according their master's instructions, and sealed away Sounga. Seven centuries later, Sounga has become one of the treasures of the Higurashi family shrine. During what should be an ordinary ritual, Sounga is freed and returns to the past through the Bone Eater's Well. The bloodthirsty spirit of the sword raises the soul of Takemaru and begins a campaign of hideous destruction. Can Inu-Yasha, Kagome, Shippo, Miroku, Sango, and Sesshomaru defeat the sword-ghoul--individually or collectively?

<p>In addition to being more violent than other <em>Inu-Yasha </em> films, <em>Swords of an Honorable Ruler </em> is more lavish, with lots of CG special effects and a score by Kaoru Wada that evokes <em>The Rite of Spring </em>. Director Toshiya Shinohara keeps things movie so briskly, the viewer doesn't have time to miss Naraku, Kikyo, or the Shikon Jewel, although the final battle goes on far too long. The drama and passion of <em>Swords of an Honorable Ruler </em> will delight <em>Inu-Yasha </em> fans. (Rated PG-13: violence, grotesque imagery, minor risqu&eacute; humor) <em>--Charles Solomon </em></p>
