<h3>Chobits Review (reviewed by Minitokyo.net)</h3><br><br><pre>
<p>Story
If you have seen or read the "dears" manga or anime than you will instantly recognize chobits, 
it is very similar to the "dears" series, im not sure which came first, but i should look 
it up lol, chobits is a cute story about a female "persecom" which is a "computer" which very 
closely resembles a human, persecoms are built to be attractive *wink*, anyway she was thrown 
out by her previous owner and is found by the main character "hideki" and thats when the fun 
starts, this is a romantic comedy, i very much enjoyed watching this anime, it was very entertaining,
i laughed alot watching this, there are alot of dramatic parts, and twists and turns in the story 
line, but the story unfolds very nicely, and of course there is alot of humor along the way ^^, 
hideki is 18 years old, at the top of his... uhm... prime, and theres alot of temptation around 
if ya know what i mean, well, you all know how romantic comedys are, alot of nose bleeds ^^ i highly 
recomend this if you like a nice story, alot of humor, and of course chicks >.<

Art
the art in this show is very new anime type style, drawings look new, clear and crisp, 
movements are very realistic and the details are nice, the scenery looks good, and 
the characters are awsomely drawn, i did not see any art mistakes at all, there are 
some cool special effects drawings in parts of the show to, which are pretty well done, 
the womens eyes in the show i noticed were drawn differently, in the fact that you cannot 
really see a pupil, its like a shaded circle, which i thought was kind of cool, and kind of 
creepy at the same time Oo, but all in all the art in the show is drawn pretty good.

Sound
the sound in this anime is surprisingly good, my favorite is the intro song, i downloaded it 
in mp3 format right after i watched this series, yeah... i sat down and watched the whole 
series in one day on dvd lol, i couldnt stop watching it, anyways, the music in the show 
is pretty darn good, like when dramatic stuff is happening, cant say much for sound effects
since there are really no battles at all, but the day to day things they do sound normal 
and there are no difformaties or anything like that, the sound is just like any other anime
when it comes to footstep sound effects and things like that, it all sounds pretty normal. 

Presentation
the presentation is exceptionally well, the story hooks you in right away, with all the 
un-answered misteries right when you end the first episode, you just have to watch more, 
and because it is so funny it makes you want to watch it even more, mind you, this anime 
is for people who like romance stuff, because it is most definetely a romance, i wouldent 
expect to see some harley biker watching this or something Oo, this show was very enjoyable
to watch, it keeps you laughing throughout most of it, its just like a sitcom, in the fact 
that hideki gets trapped in all these inescapable situations and he has to freak his way out of them 
lol there is almost no action in this show and by action i mean like... fight scenes etc. 
so its not for the kind of people who like only fighting animes, originality, since i dont know
if dears or chobits came first, so i cant really say if chobits is original or not, 
but lets just splice the two together and say these shows are pretty original in my opinion.
