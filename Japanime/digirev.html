<h3>Digimon Review (reviewed by mlanime.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>Initially this anime started out to look like another Pokemon clone. If you give it a chance and watch past the first 10 episode, they you'll find that there are lots of other qualities and character in it. This anime focus a lot on friendship, love, courage, knowledge, most virtue that are helpful and beneficial to all of us. Then comes the cuteness of those digimons. YES!!! Those little creatures are so cute when they are small. I wished they would never digivolve into bigger and meaner monsters and still defeat their enemies. Apart from that, from another perspective, the Ultimate Digivolve does also makes really cool looking monsters too. This anime has lots of merchandise if you're really into it. I wished I had a Digimon too. <p>
<h3>Anime Rating:</h3> 6.6/10
