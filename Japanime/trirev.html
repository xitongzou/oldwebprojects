<h3>Trigun Review (reviewed by animetric.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>Trigun has a great mixture of comedy, action, romance, and even some philosophy. To tell you the truth, it seemed like a show only guys would like the first time I saw it. But by the next day I already had two wall scrolls up in my bedroom! The plot is pretty complicated. It will keep you on your toes and you won’t totally get it until the last two volumes or so. What's more, it's so addictive that it will have you begging for more. Vash is a very likable character. We can all relate to Vash because he is so... human. 

The art and animation are simply amazing. While there is some blood in there, half the time it’s just ketchup. Vash and a couple of women receive a good amount of abuse, but there is nothing really explicit. Both the dubbed and the subtitled versions are excellent. The scripts don't differ much, and all the voices fit perfectly! Trigun is a fine series that has something for everyone.
