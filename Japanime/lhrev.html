<h3>Love Hina Review (reviewed by excelsis.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>The humor and hijinks start as soon as Keitaro takes on the job of managing Hinata Sou. Not only does Keitaro have to keep the place nice and orderly, he has to contend with the varying temperaments of his female tenants as well. Then there's the Tokyo U exams and the possibility that one of the girls being his elusive childhood sweetheart... Keitaro's life promises to be a lot more exciting in the days to come.

The character designs are superb. Not only do they look great, they are well thought of as well -- each having his/her own corresponding personal background and place in the story. Each one is quirky in his/her own way, and they are constantly getting themselves into the wackiest situations. There is never a dull moment at the Hinata Sou. In fact, one of the most remarkable things about Love Hina is how the plot continues to fall into place episode by episode, despite all the comedy that ensues. 

The art and animation are nothing short of spectacular -- very crisp, clear, and colorful. I heard that Love Hina's animation is fully digital, and that computers were used all throughout (which will probably explain why there isn't a single Love Hina production cel anywhere on the net). I was actually surprised by that bit of info because the whole series doesn't really sport a computer-generated look. The Japanese voices are extremely well-cast. Everyone sounds good, and the voices fit the characters perfectly. 

Love Hina is easily one of the best romantic comedies around. Highly recommended.
