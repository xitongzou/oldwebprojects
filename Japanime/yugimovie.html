<p><strong>Yu-Gi-Oh - The Movie </strong></p>
<p>
  
 Yugi, a smaller than average high school student, and an easy target for bullies, is given an ancient Egyptian riddle called the Millennium Puzzle by his grandfather, a local game shop manager. Yugi pieces the puzzle together and unexpectedly becomes the powerful Game King. Now when Yugi gets into sticky situations, the Game King takes over and protects Yugi and his friends. 

<p><strong>Editorial Overview:</strong>
<p> In their first theatrical feature, Yugi and his friends face their greatest challenge when their arch-rival Seto Kaiba obtains powerful cards from the now retired Maximillion Pegasus. More is at stake this time than a monster card championship, or even the rescue of Yugi's amateur-Egyptologist grandfather. Kaiba's challenge coincides with the discovery of the tomb of Anubis by a team of Egyptologists. The jackal-headed god is portrayed as an evil sorcerer whom the Pharaoh defeated 5,000 years ago. The resurrected wizard uses Kaiba as a pawn in his plan to destroy the world, with everything hinging on the card game between Yugi and Kaiba. The threat of world destruction is more than the premise of the series can sustain: Yugi may be a good sport, a loyal friend, and a champion player, but he's an unlikely candidate for saving the world. Neither Kaiba nor Yugi/Pharoah can play a card without screaming about the monster's power, and anyone not familiar with the game will be hopelessly lost. (MPAA rated PG: "scary combat and monster images") <em>--Charles Solomon </em>
