Ichigo Kurosaki is a 15-year old boy with an angry face. He also has he ability to see ghosts. This brings him trouble when one day, he meets a Death God named Ruki Kichiki, one who destroys Hollows, destructive beings created from dead people who are left on Earth. In an incident with a Hollow, Rukia transfers his energy to Ichigo, to create him into a Death God. As mysterious new characters arise, Ichigo must learn that the Hollows aren't his only enemy, and to destroy them, he must learn the way of a Death God.
    Kurosaki Ichigo is not a regular 15 year old, because he has always had the ability to see spirits and ghosts. One day, a female Shinigami (God of Death) named Kuchiki Rukia appears before him, hunting for an evil spirit. But during the confrontation, the Shinigami's powers are transfered to Ichigo. Thus begins the adventures of Ichigo and Rukia and their mission to herd Hollows (fallen spirits).
