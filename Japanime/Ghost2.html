<p><strong>Editorial Overview:</strong>
<p> Mamoru Oshii's landmark <em><a href="/exec/obidos/ASIN/6304493681/103-3831836-3761469">Ghost in the Shell </a></em> (1995) largely defined the cyberpunk genre and influenced the <em>Matrix </em> films in the U.S. The long-awaited sequel continues the adventures of Batou, Major Kusanagi's former assistant, who was left behind when she disappeared into the cyber-realm of the Net. With his new human partner, Togusa, Batou investigates a series of bloody murders involving <em>gynoids </em>, robots with sexual functions. The case leads them to the headquarters of the Locus Solus company, where Batou uncovers the evil secret behind the creation of the <em>gynoids </em>. <em>Innocence </em> includes some staggeringly beautiful CG images, especially a parade depicting characters from Chinese mythology. Oshii contrasts this glittering beauty with a <em>Blade Runner </em>-esque dystopia. But even his skill as a director can't disguise the fact that the underdeveloped story and flat characters are far less interesting than the opulent visuals. (Rated PG-13: graphic violence, violence against women, brief nudity, profanity, alcohol and tobacco use.) <em>--Charles Solomon </em>
