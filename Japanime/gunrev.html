<h3>Gundam Wing Review (reviewed by animetric.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>Although Gundam Wing tends to veer towards more political themes, the story branches out quickly into several engaging character-oriented subplots. The subplots intersect at certain points, and subsequently form the whole story -- much like putting the pieces of a puzzle together. Given this story-telling style, all the characters are portrayed distinctly and given ample development. It's very hard to further describe the plot without giving away spoilers. 

The art and animation are nothing short of superb. All the characters are drawn beautifully, and there are lots of pretty boys for anime fangirls to drool over. The mecha designs are very impressive and detailed as well. Even non-mecha fans won't have a hard time appreciating the Gundams' magnificence. Overall, GW is a worthwhile series which combines a deep and complex plot, well-conceptualized characters, and explosive mecha action into one spectacular package.


I sort of recommend this series - After all, I think we should all give in, stop being critics, and just let ourselves enjoy a show once in a while. <p>
<h3>Anime Rating:</h3> 8.6/10
