<p><strong>Samurai X - The motion picture</strong></p>
<p>
  
 Now we jump forward to 1879, the 12th year of the Meiji Era, where Western influence has drastically changed Japan, its people and its culture. Sailors, businessmen, and foreign dignitaries now walk the streets, and traditional Japan is being pushed aside to make room. Amidst all this hustle and bustle is a red-haired man, with an air of honor and quiet patience in this new samurai-less era. <br>
 <br>
The man is Himura Kenshin, known as the Hitokiri Battousai during the wars that lead to the establishment of the Meiji Government, and the abolition of the Shogunate ways. He and his friends Sanosuke the Gangster, Yahiko, and Lady Kaoru, are on a train to Yokohama to see the new Western houses and styles. Of course, not all changes are pleasant, as a group of off-duty sailors try to take advantage of a young woman named Toki. A lone samurai steps out of the crowd and prepares to fight the ruffians. Kaoru assists Toki to escape, while Kenshin ensures no foul play interrupts the duel. Before things can really get underway, however, the local police race in to break up the fight.. Kenshin and the samurai (known as Shigure) escape, and as the first hints about Shigure's past are revealed, the intrigue and suspense begins..

<p><strong>Editorial Overview:</strong>
<p> Although it boasts plenty of sword fights, martial arts combat, and odd, orange blood, <em>Samurai X </em> offers deeper and more sensitive characterizations than typical anime samurai epics. Based on the <em>manga </em> by Noboru Watsuki, the film centers on questions about the nature of Japanese society during the years following the Meiji Restoration in the late 19th century. Kenshin Himura and his friends Kaoru, Sanosuke, and Yahiko seem like an ordinary, slightly goofy quartet. But red-haired Kenshin is an expert swordsman; tall, lanky Sanosuke, a martial arts master; adolescent Yahiko, a samurai-in-training. Kaoru fills the role of outspoken anime heroine. An ugly encounter with some drunken British sailors introduces Kenshin and his friends to the noble Takimi Shigure and lovely Toki Takatsuki. Shigure leads a group opposed to the Meiji government, which they believe is corrupting Japanese culture, and his ill-conceived attempt at rebellion brings him into conflict with Kenshin. A key fighter in the Restoration, Kenshin received scars on his soul that mark him more decisively than the <em>X </em> on his cheek; he weeps for the needless bloodshed he helped to unleash. Director Hatsuki Tsuji builds subtle visual patterns of downward motions--falling tears, fluttering bamboo leaves, the deadly stroke of a sword, Kenshin's spectacular leaps--to create a film with an unusually satisfying resolution. Not rated; suitable for ages 14 and up for violence. <em>--Charles Solomon </em><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000056HOW/103-3831836-3761469?v=glance&n=130&s=dvd&v=glance">Buy it </a><br>
