<h4><b>History of Japanime:</b></h4>
<p><img src="alum.gif" width="420" height="5"></p>
<p>Japanime was designed to provide people with a <b>brief</b> introduction into 
various animes. It is not meant to provide an in-depth analysis into specific animes; 
  you would be better off visiting various fansites for that.
  This site was spawned off of my <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/d20/tong">DBZ fansite</a>. 
  I wanted to create a site with a more broader appeal, as well as the face that DBZ had ended 
  and I was becoming less and less infatuated with it and bored. So this site came into existence
  It was founded in 2003 intially looking the same as my DBZ site, but in 2004 got a makeover into
  a more flash based site. Now, in 2005, it uses a simpler, DHTML-based menu as well as iframes.
  People ask me why i choose to use iframes since they are problematic and are not supported by 
  Mozilla/Netscape. Well, it saves me from writing out codes and codes which are essentially the 
  same page, and it is more tedious to do so. I have provided a Mozilla-compatible version which 
  is basically the same site with popups. Yes i realize that popups are quite irritating at times
  but you have to understand i just don't have enough time to recreate the same site, albeit 
  Mozillaized (is that a word?), and the fact that im the laziest kid in the world :P. 
  But work with me here, staff/affiliates would be appreciated, I hope that Japanime would come 
  to full fruition soon (that is, acquiring a personal domain name <3~).
