<p><strong>1. Pokemon the first movie: Mewtwo versus Mew </strong></p>
<p> The world domination of Pok&eacute;mon begets their first theatrical movie. This adventure is a little more complex and dark than the popular TV series, but kids who live for the show will gobble up this film and ask for seconds. Those baffled by the show's popularity, however, will see nothing better here. Mewtwo, a new type of Pok&eacute;mon designed by scientists to be the ultimate fighter, decides he wants to rule the world and challenges all the great Pok&eacute;masters to battle. Of course, our intrepid heroes Ash, Misty, and Brock are there to tangle with Mewtwo and spoil his devilish schemes. The film is a tad more emotional than the show (that is, there is some emotion), with Ash sacrificing himself to defend his beloved Pikachu (but don't you worry, Ash will be just fine).
<p>Would you really expect the makers of this worldwide phenomenon to radically change its winning formula? The feature is only 55&nbsp;minutes long, but there's also a 20-minute short, "Pikachu's Vacation." For the Pok&eacute;mon novice, this escapade will truly baffle: the narrated tale has virtually no dialogue except Pok&eacute;mon speaking their names (Bulbasaur, for instance, will only express emotion by using variations of his name: "Bulba, Bulba-SAUR!"). It's a real curio. <em>--Doug Thomas </em></p>

<p><strong>2. Pokemon the movie 2000 </strong>
<p> Thanks to a greedy Pok&eacute;mon collector, Earth's weather patterns are askew and its population doomed unless Pok&eacute;mon trainer Ash can return three glass balls to their proper place in this second Pok&eacute;mon feature. Unlike the television show, the movie features little violence and no Pok&eacute;mon battles in the classic sense. Instead, the focus is an environmental one: what happens when humans interfere with the harmony of Earth's elements--in this case fire, ice, and lightning. Even Team Rocket have a (temporary, to be sure) change of heart, joining Ash and Misty in their effort to free the three imprisoned birdlike Pok&eacute;mon who regulate those elements. The good intentions of this 76-minute film, however, don't make it any less dull for grownups (even though this feature is better than the first). Even more mind-numbing than the feature is the lead-in short, "Pikachu's Rescue Adventure," in which Pikachu and Pok&eacute;mon friends follow Team Rocket's feline down a hole into a Munchkinland-type place. Without the humans for dialogue, viewers must endure a full 20 minutes of nothing but the squawks and squeaks of pocket monsters. As the movie's title song says, "We all live in a Pok&eacute;mon world." (Ages 3 and older.) <em>--Kimberly Heinrichs </em>

<p><strong>3. Pokemon 3: Spell of the Unown </strong>
<p> The most elaborate of the features to date, <em>Pok&eacute;mon 3: The Movie, Spell of the Unown </em> introduces new Pok&eacute;mon that debuted in the fall of 2000 in the Gold- and Silver-edition Gameboy games. En route to the Johto Tournament, Ash, Brock, and Misty visit the mountain village of Greenfield, where they encounter an 8-year-old girl named Molly. Her father, Professor Spencer Hale, disappeared when he set off to study the Unown, a group of 26 Pok&eacute;mon that resemble letters. The Unown build a baroque crystalline shell around Molly's palatial home, send the leonine Entei to watch over her, and grant whatever she wishes--except the return of her father. What Molly really wants is a family: she refers to Entei as her father and has him kidnap Ash's mom to be her mother. Ash charges to the rescue with the help of Pikachu, Charizard, and Cyndaquil. In the climactic battle, Ash is joined by Brock and Misty, as well as the usually villainous Team Rocket. ("We figure if we don't help you, we're outta showbiz," Meowth explains.) Molly's father eventually reappears, but the viewer never sees the reunion with his daughter. Ash, Molly, and the other two-dimensional characters simply don't fit into three-dimensional, computer-generated crystal settings, and large sections of <em>Pok&eacute;mon 3 </em> look like two movies unsuccessfully spliced together. A short is also included, "Pikachu and Pichu," in which the popular electric Pok&eacute;mon wanders through a big city, getting into mischief with the mouselike Pichu brothers. <em>--Charles Solomon </em>

<p><strong>4. Pokemon 4ever</strong>
<p> The fourth <em>Pok&eacute;mon </em> feature follows the pattern set by the previous three--and falls into the same traps. The TV series depicts the modest adventures of Pok&eacute;mon trainer Ash Ketcham and his friends Brock and Misty as they roam an imaginary world, fighting matches and making friends. The features add elaborate CG effects that don't mesh with the flat, drawn characters, and over-scaled threats that feel beyond Ash's abilities to resolve. Forty years ago, Sam, a young trainer, meets the 251st Pok&eacute;mon Celebi (it looks like Tinkerbell with a goldfish for a head). To escape a mean hunter, Celebi brings Sam to the present day, where they meet Ash &amp; Company. They also meet the evil Iron Mask Marauder who's supposed to be a member of Team Rocket, but who's much nastier than the comically inept Jessie, James, and Meowth. The Marauder corrupts Celebi with a "dark ball" and forces it to create a monster out of trees, branches, etc., that is blatantly copied from the Night Walker in <em>Princess Mononoke </em>. Ash and his friends eventually save the day, the Pok&eacute;mon, and the forest--but it all feels like we've been there/done that. <em>--Charles Solomon </em>

<p><strong>5. Pokemon Heroes</strong>
<p> The fifth <em>Pok&eacute;mon </em> movie takes Ash, Misty, Brock, and Pikachu to the city of Altomare, a thinly disguised Venice guarded by the shape-shifting Pok&eacute;mon Latios and Latias. Two new agents of Giovanni's, Annie and Oakley, are out to capture these rare Pok&eacute;mon--reducing Team Rocket to the role of spectators. Latios and Latias are linked to an elaborate, computer-generated mechanism that defends the city, controls the tides and brings fossil Pok&eacute;mon back to life. Ash and Pikachu foil the evil plan with some help from Misty, Brock, and Bianca, a girl who lives in Altomare with her kindly grandfather. The contrived story suggests that as far as features are concerned, the <em>Pok&eacute;mon </em> franchise has pretty much run dry. (The film earned less than $1 million in its U.S. theatrical release.) Extras include a <em>Camp Pikachu </em> short and a <em>Pok&eacute;mon Heroes </em> trivia game. (Rated G, all ages: minor cartoon violence) <em>--Charles Solomon</em><br>

<p><strong>6. Jirachi Wish Maker</strong>
<p> The sixth <em>Pok&eacute;mon </em> feature may well rank as the most satisfying entry in the series because the filmmakers avoid the overblown threats of the earlier films. Ash and Brock are joined not by Misty, but by May and her little brother Max, on a trip to a festival. Butler the magician and his assistant Diane introduce them to Jirachi, a wish-granting Pok&eacute;mon that emerges every thousand years, when the Millennium Comet appears in the sky. Max and Jirachi quickly bond. Butler tries to exploit the energy Jirachi receives from the comet to regenerate an extinct Pok&eacute;mon. He accidentally creates a monster that Ash, Max, and Jirachi have to defeat, but it's not the kind of world-threatening menace that throw the previous <em>Pok&eacute;mon </em> features out of balance. Adults may find the film tedious, but <em>Pok&eacute;mon </em>-playing children will enjoy it. (Not rated, suitable for ages 6 and older: minor cartoon violence) <em>--Charles Solomon </em>
