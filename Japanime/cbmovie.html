<p><strong>Cowboy Bebop movie: Knockin on Heaven's door </strong></p>
<p> A cargo truck explodes on a busy Martian highway, releasing a deadly biochemical weapon which kills hundreds. The biggest bounty in the history of the solar system is being offered for the one responsible, and four luckless bounty hunters and their Welsh Corgi have a lead. Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed and Ein star in their first theatrical outing, Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door, and all of the signature style that made Cowboy Bebop such a hit has followed them to the big screen. </p>
<p><strong>Editorial Overview: </strong></p>
<p>
  
 
 
 As the eagerly awaited <em>Cowboy Bebop </em> feature film reunites the original director, screenwriter, composer, and vocal cast, it's not surprising that the film plays like an expanded TV episode. What should be the routine capture of a two-bit hacker by Faye escalates into a deadly game of cat and mouse, as Spike and the gang struggle to prevent the evil Vincent Volaju from murdering every human on Mars. Director Shinichiro Watanabe handles the action sequences with his usual panache. Inside the sinister Cherious Medical research facility, Spike fights a beautiful agent, using a push broom in a series of maneuvers Jackie Chan might envy. The climactic duel between Spike and Vincent plays against innocent yet eerie images of a Halloween carnival, recalling the amusement park setting of episode 20, "Pierrot Le Fou." <em>Knockin' on Heaven's Door </em> will delight fans of the series and provide an excellent introduction for the uninitiated who want to know why <em>Cowboy Bebop </em> is so popular on both sides of the Pacific.
