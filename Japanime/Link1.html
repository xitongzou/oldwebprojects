<p>Welcome to Japanime! I'm Gofishus, the webmaster. First off, I'm not going to be updating much because I just don't have the time or patience to update daily. I'll try to get the animes finished but be patient, school and parents, etc are making me very stressed x_x. Any news or info i will post on the tagboard or in the news section. If you have further information please visit the <a href="FAQs.html">FAQs</a>, <a href="Contact.html">Contact</a> & <a href="History.html">History</a>
   sections. 
Remember that this site gives brief information about each anime series/movie. If u want detailed information, then check out a specific fansite. But do enjoy my site, and don't be afraid to sign the guestbook or comment on the tagboard  =P. </p>

For the record, I have 2 ISU's to do, 2 books to read and take notes on, a comparative essay and a cause-effect essay, a political mindmap, a 20-minute seminar amongst several tests and upcoming exams. I've also moved to a <a href="http://japanime.simply-torn.net">new domain </a>. Soo go visit my site there =D </span></span></p>
