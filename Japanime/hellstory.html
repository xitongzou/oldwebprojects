Hellsing is about an orginization of people devoted to killing vampires and FREAKS (artificial undead). The institute is known as the Hellsing Institution or the Royal Protestant Knight Organization. The leaders of the Hellsing Institution are directly descended from Baron Van Helsing (from the novel Dracula) himself. Sir Integra Wingates Hellsing is currently the leader of trhis organization. She was made to lead the organization when her father met his untimelydeath while she was about twelve. her uncle tried to kill her so that he would be able to control the organization, but Integra, remembering her father's words, fled to the basement and through a door on which a pentagram was painted in blood. As she entered, she was shot and a pool of blood formed in front of a corpse. Her uncle moved to finishe her off when the people gathered in the chamber realized that the corpse was a vampire. The vampire killed everyone except the uncle, who Integra killed, and pleged his allegiance to Integra. From there on out, the vampire, Alucard (Dracula backwards) became the most powerful weapon of the Hellsing Institution. On a mission to destroy a rogue priest, the policewoman Celas (Ceras in some translations) Victoria was placed in a life or death situation. The priest held her in front of his heart as Alucard aimed to fire at him. Alucard gave Victoria the choice to live as a vampire or die, and she chose to live. He shot thoguth her lung and killed the priest. Afterward he bit her and made her a vampire. The show deals with her struggle to resist her natural bloodlust and sometimes evil tendencies, as well as the problems the Hellsing Institution encounters from the Vatican.
