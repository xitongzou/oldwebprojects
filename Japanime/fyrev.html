<h3>Fushigi Yuugi Review (reviewed by animetric.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>What can I say except WOW. FY is definitely one of the best series I've ever seen. 

Fast-paced and unpredictable, each episode leaves one breathless with anticipation. You can watch this for hours and not even think of eating or sleeping. Everything is so rich in imagery and emotion that it's like actually going on an adventure with Miaka and the gang. Love, friendship, betrayal, war, revenge, magic... just about everything is mixed in. There are a lot of insanely funny moments too. 

A huge number of characters comprise FY. The admirable part is, everyone is developed very well and it doesn't get confusing. Characterization is very deep. They can make you laugh, cry, and feel so many things. You'll find that there is a reason for everything everyone does in FY. Even the bad guys aren't all bad. 

FY immerses us in a whole new world with its own people, culture, and environment. Konan, the country Miaka gets thrown in, is much like ancient China -- down to the clothing, language, food, etc. The settings are amazingly detailed. There is a sharp contrast between Konan and modern day Japan, which serves as the perfect stage for FY. 

With regards to the visual aspect, FY is exquisitely drawn and animated. The quality is also consistent throughout all 52 episodes. All the songs and music fit the series perfectly -- everything is pleasing to the ear and easy to get into. Some of the songs are Chinese sounding (although the lyrics are in Japanese) due to the nature of Konan. The FY soundtracks feature some of the best songs I've ever heard. The English dubbing is okay, I guess. I just can't stand some of the English voices, especially Chichiri's. It also gets to me when they mispronounce words. I'd go with the Jap dialogues instead. What's more, the DVD boxed sets are packed. Aside from getting magnificently designed boxes, you get extras like image galleries, credit-less OP's and ED's, interviews with creator Yuu Watase, and loads of background info. Definitely well worth the money.
