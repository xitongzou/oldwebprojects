Vash the Stampede is a gunman on the run with a 60 billion double dollar bounty on his head which has made it difficult for him to go anywhere without 
being chased and shot at. Because of the bounty, every town he ever visit ends up being destroyed 
because of his pursuers, but miraculously no one ever gets killed. 
Meryl and Milly are two insurance agents that have been sent to find 
Vash the Stampede and keep him under surveillance so no more damage is caused. 
Meryl, who leads the pair, can't believe that the man they have met can possibly be the 
legendary gunman. 
However, there's more to Vash than just smiles and donuts; a dark past that 
he would like to leave behind is hounding him, and some people are pursuing 
him for other reasons than the bounty.
