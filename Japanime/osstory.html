Space is mainly inhabited by three different groups: the Federation, which is the real government; Various pirate clans, which use special techniques and magic to dominate the frontier; and the outlaws which are just about everywhere in between. There are also various alien races and empires which sort of fall within this category.

It is on this frontier where Gene Starwind and his 11-year old partner Jim Hawking, freelance bounty hunters and odd-job takers extraordinare, live and work. Until they happen to take a job from a mysterious woman named Hilda. In no time flat they're up to their ears in pirates desparate to get their hands on her and her secrets - an experimental spacecraft built using the pirate's knowledge and the Federation's technology, and information on the wherabouts of the Galactic Leyline. When Hilda is killed by the pirates, the ship is left to Gene. It's his ticket to freedom in space; and a big red flag for trouble, as every pirate and outlaw in the galaxy starts gunning for him.

Together with Jim, android and ship computer Melphena, ass-whooping metamorph Eisha Kurankuran, and the assasin Suzuka, Gene boldly steps force to face the future and discover the secrets behind the Galactic Leyline and his ship - the Outlaw Star.
