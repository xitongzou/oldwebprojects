<p><strong>1. The Dead Zone </strong></p>
<p>
  
 Garlic Jr., son of Kami's onetime rival for the position of Earth's protector, seeks the Dragonballs so that he can summon Shen Long and wish for immortality, after which he will plague the Earth with all manner of demons in retribution for his father's demise. After his men ambush Piccolo, they kidnap Gohan to get the Dragonball in his hat, not realizing that he is the son of Goku. Goku comes looking to recover his son, but he isn't the only one with a bone to pick with Garlic Jr. and his men. Can Garlic Jr. be stopped before he rains chaos on the Earth?

<p><strong>2. World's Strongest</strong>
<p> Thanks to the Dragon Balls and his dedicated assistant Dr. Kochin, the evil Dr. Wheelo has been freed from his icy comb. Now these mad scientists plot to take over the world with their fearsome biotechnology… There's just one hitch. Dr. Wheelo's body died, and now his brain is living in a glass jar! Dr. Wheelo seeks the strongest, healthiest body in the world to be the new home for his magnificent brain, so Dr. Kochin and their android warriors kidnap Master Roshi as well as Bulma to find the world strongest fighter. It's Goku, Gohan, and Krillin to the rescue of their friends. But will our heroes save the day or lose their minds?!
<p><strong>3. Tree of Might</strong>
<p> Needing the Earth to grow the "Shinseiju" (the "Tree of Might" in the English dub), Taurus - who looks just like Goku but is of no relation - and his men plant the seed, since the fruit of the tree gives the person who eats it a giant power up. Taurus also has his eyes on Gohan, who's the strongest Saiyajin due to his amazing potential. With his minions, Taurus defeats all the Z Senshi, including Goku, but Goku has a few surprises. <br>
<p><strong>4. Lord Slug</strong>
<p> To regain his youth, Slug comes to Earth to gather the dragon balls. Once his wish has been granted, Slug attempts to destroy Earth, since it is turning into a frozen wasteland due to the sun being blocked (Do you understand yet why so many hate this movie so?) When fighting Goku, he shows his true power and form. Yet, when all seems lost, Piccolo and Gohan help Goku win. <br>
<p><strong>5. Cooler's Revenge</strong>
<p> To avenge his dead brother, Coola comes to Earth to kill the Super Saiyajin. With his Tokusentai, Coola defeats Goku, Gohan, Kuririn, and Piccolo. But when fearing the death of all life on Earth, Goku transforms, and even Coola's final form won't be enough to win
<p><strong>6. Coola Returns</strong>
<p> With the New Planet Namek being eaten by the Giant Ghetti Star, the Z Senshi fly to the planet in a Capsule Corp. spaceship. Seeing that the entire Namekseijin race has been enslaved by large robots, Goku, Gohan, Piccolo, Kuririn, Yajirobe, Roshi, and Oolong try to help, only to learn that the person behind this occurrence is Coola. Now a metallic robot, Metal Coola is taking revenge on the people who lived on the planet where Furiza was killed. With Goku there, Metal Coola has another chance to avenge his dead brother. With Vegeta's help, Coola is destroyed. But from the Ghetti Star hundreds of Metal Coola's suddenly begin to arrive.&nbsp; 
<p><strong>7. Super Android 13</strong>
<p> Creating three new androids in the spirit of Dr. Gero's hatred for Goku, Dr. Gero's computer sends the androids out to complete Gero's plan on killing Goku. The first two to go out are 14 and 15, who attack Goku while he is shopping with Chichi and Gohan. Not wanting to destroy the city they're in, Goku and Trunks leave for an uninhabited Arctic area. The fight seems even until Android 13 shows up - at least until Vegeta and Piccolo arrive. Just when the fight seems won, 13 shows off his "Super" form, changing the battle's outcome y et again. 
<p><strong>8. Brolly: Legendary Super Saiyan</strong>
<p> Paragus comes to Earth seeking Vegeta. He wants Vegeta to return with him to what Paragus claims to be Planet New Vegeta. However, Paragus and the planet aren't what they seem, and Paragus' son, Burori, is the legendary Super Saiyajin, born with a power level of 10,000. Since Goku was the only person who ever made Burori cry (which occurred when they were infants). Burori loses control and tries to kill everyone. After an amazing battle, everyone seems beaten, but Goku isn't as weak as Burori thought. 
<p><strong>9. Bojack Unbound </strong>
<p> Having another Tenkaichi Budoukai funded by Mr. Money for his son's birthday, Mr. Satan invites everyone on Earth to a competition on a remote island. The Z Senshi all go, and Goku - who is still dead with Kaio-Sama - wishes he could compete. After the elimination rounds, the winners reach the final where Mr. Satan's students are dressed as aliens (or so it seems) and are to serve as foes for the warriors. However, Bojack and his men, who were at one time imprisoned within a star by the Kaios, have changed things in secret. They take over the tournament and fight the Z Senshi. After all seems lost, Goku's words of encouragement give Gohan the power he needs to stand up to Bojack and his men. 
<p><strong>10. Brolly: Second Coming</strong>
<p> While searching for the dragon balls, Goten, Trunks, and Videl encounter Burori, who crash landed on Earth after supposedly being defeated in DBZ movie 8. The three don't do well against Burori until Gohan arrives to help. Despite the years between the fight on New Vegeta and the present battle, even Gohan's Super Saiyajin 2 form isn't strong enough to compete against Burori. All seems lost until the dragon balls perform a miracle. 
<p><strong>11. Bio Brolly</strong>
<p> Challenged by Jaga Bada, Mr. Satan goes to Jaga's island along with Android 18 who wants her money for throwing the Budoukai. Trunks and Goten tag along seeking adventure. When at Jaga's place, Bio Warriors are shown to be Mr. Satan's fight. Wanting this whole incident to be over quickly so she can get her money, 18 decides to fight the Bio Warriors instead of Hercule Satan. Goten and Trunks join the fight for the shear fun of it. After this little battle is over, Goten and Trunks discover a cloning vessel that has grown a clone of Brolly. After breaking free, Brolly again tries to fight Trunks and Goten, but only to be engulfed with an acid. Thinking that this killed Brolly, the warriors are proved wrong as Brolly gets up as a hideously deformed monster. After another long fight, they once again think that Brolly is defeated. Unfortunately, Brolly surfaces as a gigantic monster. Now, Goten, Trunks, and Krillin can't defeat Brolly, but Brolly finds his match in the seawater. 
<p><strong>12. Rebirth of Fusion: Goku and Vegeta</strong>
<p> Not paying attention to the evil cleansing machine in Hades, a young demon is possessed by all the evil in the machine when it overloads and blows up, creating a large and powerful demon named Janemba. With the once controlled evil now released, Enma Daimoa (King Yamma) is imprisoned in his castle and powerless to do anything about the new demon. Goku and Paikuhan answer the call for help. In attempting to free Enma, they learn the only way to succeed is by destroying Janemba. Goku flies into hell to face him while Paikuhan continues to attempt to free Enma. After transforming into Super Saiyajin 3, Goku defeats the large yellow demon and thinks he has won. Unfortunately, the demon has also changed into a smaller, red and much more powerful demon too strong for even Super Saiyajin 3 Goku. Vegeta arrives and joins Goku in the battle. But they learn the only way to win this fight is through Fusion.
<p><strong>13. Dragon Fist Explosion </strong>
<p> After encountering a strange old man named Hoi who tends an oracle, Gohan and Videl bring the oracle to Capsule Corp. for examination. The Z Warriors discover the oracle was truly not of Earth, then set out to find the dragon balls and summon Shenron to open the oracle. They succeed, and a strange and mysterious man named Tapion emerges from the oracle, playing his ocarina. Tapion is horrifically terrified for being released, since he holds a secret that could destroy an entire galaxy. <br>
