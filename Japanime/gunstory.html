It is the year A.C. 195.
The United Earth Sphere Alliance is run by the richest and most elite people on Earth, while up in space the poorer people must live in space colonies. The Alliance is run by an organization named Oz, and they are not very kind to the space colonies. To maintain the colonies, the Alliance sent mobile suits to destroy any resistance. Colonies were placed under martial law, and communication between the colonies was prohibited. After years of oppression, the colonies decide to fight back. Some scientists decide to create 5 amazing-looking mobile suits made of Gundanium alloy in order to counter Oz's forces in guerrilla warfare. This series follows the five Gundam pilots and their journey to restore true peace between Earth and the space colonies.
