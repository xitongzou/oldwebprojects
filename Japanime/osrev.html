<h3>Outlaw Star Review (reviewed by animetric.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>Outlaw Star is a true masterpiece. The plot is very intriguing, and each episode makes the search for the Galactic Leyline more and more exciting. The mood changes a lot, swinging back and forth from happy to depressing and back. Characterization is good. Each character has his/her own unique personality and motive. You just have to love everybody in this anime. The art and animation are superb. The mechanical designs are the best I have seen yet and the ship-to-ship battles are very impressive. With its breathtaking action and sophisticated story, Outlaw Star is a must-have for any anime video library. If you love sci-fi and adventure, this is title is for you.

<h3>Anime Rating:</h3> 8.8/10
