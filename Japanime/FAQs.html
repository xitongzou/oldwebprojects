<p><img src="alum.gif" width="420" height="5"></p>
<p>Q: Where did the name Japanime come from?<br>
A: Simple: combine Japanese and anime = Japanime. <p>
Q: Where did you get the name Gofishus/Proximus?<br>
A: I actually stole it off one guy from the DBZGTLegacy forums,<br>
his name was Gofishus Maximus and I thought it was kinda cool so 
ever since, I've been using Gofish, or Gofishus. Proximus was a 
completely original name i used to play gunbound but have since grown attached to. <br>
Q: Why do you use Iframes?<br>
A: It saves me time from remaking my pages specifically.<p></p>
Q: How long have you been interested in HTML & Anime?<br>
A: Ever since I was 12, I've been reading html and watching/dling<br>
anime episodes.<p></p>
Q: What are your favorite animes?<br>
A: Rurouni Kenshin, Evangelion, Naruto, Love hina, Gundam Seed, etc.<br>
I have alot =P.<p></p>
Q: Can I request an anime to be reviewed?<br>
A: Sure, just email me or talk to me on msn and I can probably do it.<p></p>
Q: I don't like how the Mozilla version uses popups<br>
A: Again, not enough time or patience to make a seperate Mozilla version.<p></p>
Q: Why does your site take a long time to load?<br>
A: It might be because I'm using alot of dynamic HTML on the menu's and such. I'll try to make
it as simple yet feasible as possible.
<p>Q: Why aren't you on AIM that much?<br>
  A: Because I don't like AOL and I rarely talk on it anyways.
</p>
Q: Yo N00b get a domain name instead of someone hosting it for you.<br>
A: I would if I had the money to dish out monthly/Annually.
<p>Q: Can I be part of the staff?<br>
  A: Yes! Just email me and tell me what you will do and how you will benefit me
   and I'll tell you if you can help me. I will give you full credit on any sections you do.</p>
<p>Q: Why do the links to Episodes and Music videos go to Fileplanet?<br>
A: I don't have enough space or bandwidth to host episodes or music vids. This IS angelfire, after all.
<p></p>
 Q: Why don't you update much?<br>
A: I'm a lazy person, and I just hate updating lol. You can really tell if you've<br>
 visited my blog pages.
 <p>Q: Why are you so lazy?<br>
  A: Because some people just are. I can't change myself, sorry =P.</p>
 <p></p>
 Q: Why does the forums link take me to gaiaonline?<br>
A: Did you really think that so many people would come here that i required a forum?
Besides, Gaia Online is way cooler than any forum I can conceive of.
<p>Q: Can i submit Fanfics/Fanart?<br>
  A: Of course, just email me (Gofishus@hotmail.com).
