In the year 12,090 A.D., ten thousand years after the nuclear destruction of civilization, monsters and mutants roam the European countryside. A feudal society has arisen in which human peasants are ruled by immortal vampire aristocrats. Doris Lang, a young rancher, is casually bitten by Count Magnus Lee, the local vampire lord. 
A mysterious vampire hunter known only as "D" rides into the community on a cyborg horse. Doris offers her ranch as his headquarters -- and offers herself to him -- if he will free the townsfolk from vampiric tyranny. Doris' young brother, Dan, clearly hero-worships the lean warrior, but D maintains a silent, distant attitude which puzzles them. 

In town, Greco, the mayor's vain son, offers to protect Doris from the Count if she will wed him. When she refuses. he reveals that she has been bitten by Lee. The townsfolk are divided over whether to imprison her as a prospective vampire, or to give her to Lee to placate him. Only "D" and her old friend, Dr. Fearing, the community's kindly physician, offer to stand up for her. Mayor Roman and Sheriff Danton finally agree to let her stay in exile at her ranch pending the result of D's confrontation with the Count.
Meanwhile Count Lee, bored with his endless life, decides to marry Doris to toy with her at his leisure. His haughty daughter, Lamica, is horrified by the thought of having a common human stepmother. It is up to D to decide the fate of Doris as well as the Count....
<p><strong>Editorial Overview:</strong>
<p> D, a haunted half-human, half-vampire warrior, wanders the countryside of a feudalistic future, hunting his own kind while battling his own evil nature. Like a rogue samurai, the silent, solitary hero wanders into a small hamlet terrorized by the all-powerful Count, a monstrous vampire lord, and his demonic minions from a castle that casts a long shadow over the countryside. The Count has claimed the human Doris (who wields a mean cutlass herself) as his bride. D becomes her protector and--when she's captured by the Count's shape-shifting minions--her savior. Designed in slashes and sharp, angular images and directed with abrupt explosions of lightning-fast action, <em>Vampire Hunter D </em> is violent and bloody in the mode of a samurai adventure. The sleek D is appropriately dark and quiet, cutting a mysterious figure, while the Count is a veritable demon of a vampire, a supernaturally powerful monster whose appetites know no bounds. The undercurrent of sexuality never spills over into the sadistic vein of so many "adults only" thrillers, but it is recommended for mature audiences.

<p>The DVD features both English and Japanese language soundtracks with optional English subtitles. It also has a documentary featurette, deleted footage, and an artwork gallery by Amano among its supplements. <em>--Sean Axmaker </em></p>
