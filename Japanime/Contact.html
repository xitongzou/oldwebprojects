<b>Information:</b>
<img src="alum.gif" width="440" height="5">
My real name is actually Tom (chinese name Tong) and i
have been involved in HTML since...grade 7 i believe 
(now im in grade 12). I don't really have much knowledge
outside HTML/CSS/Javascript (although i have designed 
Visual Basic.net and certain Flash-based programs) and 
if i had patience i would take the time to learn PHP and 
ASP =P. As you can see,I'm very interested in computers 
and technology in general.I used to play alot of video 
games too but now that i have school and stuff i don't 
have as much time as i used to. In my spare time, im 
usually on the comp chattin or out working or playing my
guitar xP. Really, I don't get mad easily and i pretty 
much get along with most people. Oh, and you can comment 
on my blogs if you want to, but i rarely ever update :P. <br>

Quote: "True power lies in your ability to control the fate of others..."
"'If the doors of perception were to be cleansed every thing would appear 
to man as it is, infinite'"
"'Experience is the name that everyone gives to their mistakes'"
"'The pure and simple truth is rarely pure and never simple'"
"'Expect the Unexpected'"
&quot;'Knowledge is power'&quot;
&quot;'What's more desirable: to be loved or to be feared?'&quot;
&quot;'Love is just a better form of hate'&quot;<br>

<!-- My Oath:

There comes a time when destiny calls forth 
a being and demands a sacrifice. Now is that
time, I am that being, this is my doctrine. 
every day, I am tormented eternally and every 
night,lamented infinitely. I am without doubt, 
without a soul, without a true purpose. I am the 
sever of souls, a light that darkness cannot prevail. 
For without virtue, there cannot be love and without 
love there cannot be hate. Only the quintessential 
illusions of hope and despair will confine me to 
my prison. A meaningless person with a careless soul. 
This is I and I cannot be vanquished. For 
the soul of Gofishus Maximus will live 
throughout my life and my actions. 
My gift, my curse, my blessing, my burden, 
living in spite of it, and 
longing for the day that i will be free.
 My name is Tong Zou 
and this is my vow. -->
