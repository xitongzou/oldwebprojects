My Oath:

There comes a time when destiny calls forth 
a being and demands a sacrifice. 
Now is that time, 
I am that being, this is my doctrine. 
every day, I am tormented eternally and 
every night,lamented infinitely. 
I am without doubt,without a soul, 
without a true purpose.
I am the sever of souls, a light that 
darkness cannot prevail. 
For without virtue, there cannot be love 
and without love there cannot be hate. 
Only the quintessential illusions of hope 
and despair will confine me to my prison.
A meaningless person with a careless soul. 
This is I and I cannot be vanquished. For 
my vengeful soul will live 
throughout my life and my actions. 
My gift, my curse, my blessing, my burden, 
living in spite of it, and 
longing for the day that i will be free.
 My name is Tom 
and this is my vow.
