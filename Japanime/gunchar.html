<h2>Heero Yuy</h2><br><br>
<tr><td><img src="images/heero.jpg" alt="" height="200" width="150"></td>
<td>Heero can be considered the main character of Gundam Wing. With a dark and mysterious past, Heero's humanity was taken from him leaving him feeling that emotions weren't needed. He plans everything perfectly and leaves no room for mistakes, and he'll do whatever it takes to complete his missions - even if it means his own life. His skills as a pilot are exceptional and Heero is even able to master the infamous Zero System. Thus, Heero is thought to be a perfect solider, however, he has feeling for Relena that he tries to keep hidden. This is just further proof that deep inside he has a kind heart that wishes to be freed.

After this church was destroyed, he took the identity of the God of Death, and took the last name of "Maxwell". It is also for this reason that Duo dresses in the outfit of a priest. Duo, ironically, calls himself the God of Death and will kill anyone that stand in his path. His attitude is different from the other gundam pilots. This, however, proves to be an asset as his charming personality comes in handy more than once.

<tr><td><img src="images/trowa.jpg" alt="" height="200" width="150"></td>
<td>Trowa is the quietest of the mobile pilots and hides himself within a traveling circus. He makes a very sad clown and even the mask he uses to cover half his face acts as a sad metaphor to the pain and loneliness within his heart. At times, he's unsure of himself and compares himself to Heero. This proves to be a weakness as he makes his decisions too quickly without thinking them through. Trowa also pretends to be other people. He assumes the name "Trowa" after witnessing the death of the real Trowa. Before that, he would call himself "no name". He's actually quite depressing an incapable of expressing many emotions. Trowa finds a sense of friendship within the mobile suit pilots that he never felt before, and this allows him to begin to feel.

He fails to open up his eyes and see the big picture. He doesn't like accepting help and therefore doesn't get along that well with the other Gundam pilots. He does, however, have respect for Heero and Major Sally. Within his head, Wufei struggles to find his true purpose. Even though Wufei may be annoying, he's a key member of the team.
