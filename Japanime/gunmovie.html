<p><strong>Gundam Wing - Endless Waltz </strong></p>
<p>
  
 After Colony 196 - One year has passed since the war between Earth and its colonies ended. Heero, Duo, Trowa and Quatre bid farewell to their Gundams and jettison them to the sun. Relena Darlian is now the deputy minister of the Earth Sphere Unified Nation. But as the Gundam pilots are adjusting to the peace on Earth, Relena is kidnapped and a new threat appears, led by Marimeia Khushrenada - daughter of the late dictator Treize Khushrenada and heir to the Barton Foundation. To make matters more complicated, Gundam Nataku pilot Wufei has sided with this faction. The Gundam pilots must recover their mobile suits and once again engage in battle before Marimeia's forces succeed on their bid for global domination. 
<p><strong>Editorial Overview:</strong>
<p> This three-part OAV adventure picks up one year after the conclusion of the <em>Gundam Wing </em> series. Earth and the Space Colonies have joined to form the Earth Sphere Unified Nation; after a brief reign as Queen, Relena Peacemaker has abdicated and is serving as a government minister. The Gundams have been hidden or sent into an orbit that impacts with the sun.
<p>The fragile peace is shattered when the sinister Dekim Barton instigates a revolt to make Mariemeia, the illegitimate daughter of former OZ chief Treize Krushrenada, absolute ruler of the new nation: part of an Endless Waltz of "peace, war, and revolution." If Earth refuses to accept her rule, they will crash one of the orbiting colonies into the planet's surface. Naturally, only the Gundam pilots Heero, Duo, Trowa, Quatre, and Chang can resolve this crisis--with a little help from their friends and former enemies.
<p>Told largely through flashbacks, the story reveals the backgrounds of the pilots. When peace is restored, they trigger the self-destruct circuits in their Gundams and the narrator announces that Mobile Suits "were never seen again." But fans know that in the Gundam universe, there's always the chance of a sequel.
<p>Rated 7 and up. There is some cartoon violence, largely restricted to machines attacking each other. <em>--Charles Solomon </em></p>
