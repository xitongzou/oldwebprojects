<h3>Medabots Review (reviewed by animelab.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>In short? "Medabots" is a hugely underrated show, which, in actuality, really should be considered one of, if not the, defining shows of the "creature collecting/training/fighting" genre. 

Long version? Well, let's begin by saying that "Medabots" began with little to no hint of the quality that it would later take on. Set in the 22nd century, "Medabots" tells the story of a world where everyone has a Medabot - commercially-available robots powered by objects called Medals, used for competetive combat known as "Robattling." Now, with this basic description, it is indeed clearly routed in the "creature collecting/training/fighting" genre, along with Pokemon and the like. 

So, I'll definitely not try and tell you it's original, no sir, because it's not. 

But just because it's original does NOT, in any way, mean it's BAD. No sir, because it's what "Medabots" DOES with this premise that it's fellow genre shows can only dream of equalling. 

A 52 episode series, it was split up and reshuffled into two 26 episode seasons for it's dub, presumably because they made the first season in view of the possibility they may not have done a second. The defining quality of "Medabots," specifically in it's early, pre-arced-plot period, is it's humour. Now, forgive this criticism, but the fact is, the Japanese don't have a lot of wit about them. Comedy anime tends to be smash-bam over-the-top slapstick. Well, the dub of "Medabots" takes the comedy that already exists in it, and actually managed to inject WIT into the show, with very cleverly written scripts which are often the superior of the Japanese dialogue. 

The animation is a little crude. It's not BAD, no, because, you see, it's MEANT to look that way. That's how the character designs look. The animation is styled around them. It's all an intended look and feel, that perfectly compliments the show. 

The series begins with fun, one-shot episodic tales, which have little to tie each other together, really. We meet Ikki Tenryou, and his Medabot, Metabee, powered by a special, rare medal which makes him the target of the criminal organisation, the Rubberrobo Gang, and the mysterious vigilante, the Phantom Renegade. Ikki and his friends - including Erika, Karin and Koji - and his rivals, the schoolyard bullies, the Screws - Samantha, Spyke and Sloan - get up to what one can only term "wacky adventures." However, once the halfway point of this first season has passed, an arced plot kicks, and grabs you right away. There is more to both the Rubberrobos and the Phantom Renegade than meets the eye, as well as the mystery of the secret power of the rare medals, the Medaforce. Once again, these aspects are not especially original, but it is the way they are *implimented*, artfully woven together from episode to episode, that is really what holds you attention, and makes you want to keep watching from episode to episode. As this season moves towards it's conclusion, the World Robattle Championships are looming, and Ikki has to keep his high spot in the rankings to ensure his place at that tournament - but also must cope with the mysterious Space Medafighter X, and the true leader of the Rubberrobo gang, Doctor Meta-Evil, who has great plans for the power of Metabee's rare medal. 

Now, the second American season is a slightly different story, because to create a 26 episode first season with a defined ending, it required removing episodes from the running. Most of these were inconsequential, bar two, and all of them are then used to make up the first half of the second season. Reshuffling aside, it spreads the series out better than the Japanese did, with a series of episodic stories, a building arc and climax, then a wind down with more episodics, and then the final building arc and climax - while the Japanese simply had fully half the series be episodics, then launch two rapid-fire arcs in the second half. 

Indeed, it is the episodic nature of the early "Medabots" that was the show's biggest flaw. It is not to say there were not entertaining, because they certainly were, it's simply that they didn't appear to be going anywhere, and people need more than that in their cartoons these days. So, many people didn't stick it though to when it got really good (I would imagine this went double for Japan). 

The final arc of the series is, in a word, incredible. Ikki and Koji are at the world championships, and have troubles to face when Space Medafighter X can't show his face. The battles between the various teams take some time to really get going, but slowly, the hints which have been dropped through season one about a terrible event eight years in the past are expanded on, until the truth stands revealed. And even then, there is more to the tale, as the Rubberrobos raise their heads again, and the final, climactic battle has it's roots eons in the past, in the violent history of the Medabot race. 

This arc is brilliantly written, gradually revealing each piece of the puzzle that's been implied in the past, and piecing them together in such a way that you're left guessing and surprised up until the very end. It is able to intelligently weave the show's trademark humour with moments of darkness and violence expertly, in a way that it doesn't feel unusual at all. 

It's a crying shame that "Medabots" doesn't really court any fandom to speak of, but that's because of two things. 

1 - Too much episodic stuff to start with. While entertaining, it gave away no hint of the greatness that was to come, and people didn't stick around for it. It would have been better weaved between the plot, rather than acting as a precursor to it. 

2 - The dub was Nelvana-made, and people shy away from that after the "CardCaptors" fiasco, despite the fact that "Medabots" has a dub that out-does the original in many ways, all of them good. 

"Medabots" most assuredly started out as "just another" part of the "creature battle" genre, and yes, it took time to get itself going - but what it did when it really got started turned the show and all preconceived notions about it totally on it's head, shaping one of the most intricate, intelligently-written, perfectly-directly shows that the genre has seen. 

Other shows could learn a lot from "Medabots."
