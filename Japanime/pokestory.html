In the fantastic world of Pokémon, kids are permitted to become Pokémon trainers -- 
and the best of them may some day become Pokémon masters! That's the dream 
for Ash Ketchum, our young hero who embarks on his journey with a secret 
that gives him an edge: his special love for these amazing creatures helps 
him beat incredible odds and makes seemingly impossible things happen! To 
become a great Pokémon trainer, Ash must catch as many wild Pokémon as possible.
 But it's not easy, because each of the Pokémon possess special powers and abilities.
  To catch one, he must first challenge it in a match with a Pokémon of his own. 
	If Ash plays it just right, the wild Pokémon will find itself captured in a 
	PokéBall -- and part of Ash's team.<br><br>
	It's an incredible adventure that takes our heroes around the world, underground and across the sea -- all the while discovering new and amazing things about everyone's favorite creatures – Pokémon!
