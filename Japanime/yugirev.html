<h3>Yu-Gi-OH Review (reviewed by animelab.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>Yu-Gi-Oh! is one of the best anime shows on right now, mainly because it has the best plot. Others, such as Mucha Lucha, have a different plot for every episode, while Yu-Gi-Oh! has one big plot for the entire thing, with smaller plots in between. It helps the viewers stay focused and want to watch more. 
However, the episodes tend to go on a bit longer than needed. In the duels, there is more talking than dueling, so a duel that should just take one episode normally takes two or three. There really is nothing wrong with that, except that the majority of people would rather see the ending than some pointless chatter. Yu-Gi-Oh! does have a rather interesting plot, so that is why many people watch it. Also, it has a card game to go along with it, so that keeps it popular as well.<p>
<h3>Anime Rating:</h3> 8.5/10
