<p><strong>Naruto Movie </strong></p>
<p> Kakashi orders Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura to watch a movie before their next mission. Naruto is a big fan of the lead actress. After the movie, they see the heroine in person and being chased. They help her and Naruto asks for an autograph but she wouldn't give him one. When the three returns, Kakashi tells them about their mission: to escort the actress to the Snow Country to film a new movie. <br>

  <tr><td valign="top">As far as fitting in with the storyline of the series, this movie doesn't. It runs parallel between about episodes 100-102 of the series due to the level of development the characters in the movie have reached. <br>
        <br>
    Let's begin with the visuals. The Design and Style are pretty much flawless - nice lightning, excellent imagery, carried over from the series - but the Detail, Artwork, and Animation are not quite up to par for a movie. The Detail and Artwork share their flaws - the details and artwork in the background are decent but don't fare as well when applied to foreground objects, most noticably characters. The animation lacks in frames for the slower moving scenes and is unfortunately hard to miss. However, the difficult thing to catagorise is the consistency of these flaws - they improve and falter throughout the movie, meaning it's impossible to simply say they are "bad", since they are aren't that bad all the time - in fact, for the action scenes (for example) the animation is wonderful, and detail + artwork is also stepped up. <br>
    <br>
    The sound only has one minor flaw - the closing theme. I didn't particularly like it. Everything else, shares the same positive qualities with the series - the voice acting is good, the musical scores are superb, and the background/foreground sounds are atmospheric. <br>
    <br>
    The story is fun to watch but suffers from the following aspects: the main premise of the story is a little dull and not entirely well executed - the movie doesn't really have a proper beginning and end, and thus the problems of the Snow Princess don't really feel very interesting since there isn't a lot of time spent to make you smpathise with her and her country's problems; there are a few boring bits that could have been smoothed out - since there wasn't enough time given to build up the atmosphere of the problematic situation of the movie, whenever there's a flashback describing the past of the Snow Princess, it just feels like it's in the way, and that it's using up precious time that could be spent on action, plot or character developement. But even with these flaws, the story didn't feel contrived or too corny, it flowed rather well for what it was and was interesting to watch too. <br>
    <br>
    Many of the much loved characters from the Naruto series are very much abscent from this movie. In fact, only Naruto, Sakura, Sasuke and Kakashi are present, with the rest of the cast being made up of new faces that are relevent to the particular story of the movie. I liked the character development in the movie - especially between Naruto and the Princess, which was almost lost due to the seemingly lack of gratitude shown from the Princess, but saved at the last moment after the end credits of the movie where there is a little scene that finishes it nicely. I only had 2 minor beefs with the characters - from the main 4, only Naruto is given a decent amount screen time. The others don't feel very present most of the time, even though they have a few action scenes dedicated to them and their abilities. The other beef is the way the Snow Princess seems so pitiful in the movie. If it was overdone any more than that it would have been really irritating. At present she just gets away with it without hindering the movie too much. <br>
    <br>
    Unlike the series, this movie has a much higher replay value due to being consise and simultaneously action packed. If all the slow bits were erradicated it would be even more watchable. Another slight reason for not giving it a higher score is the fact that the movie is a snapshot of Naruto's ability and development at around episode 100 - since the series is very much continuing and becoming more ambitious in its action and skill level (definately by episode 133), the series now appears far superior in content, meaning there is a minor dullness to watching the movie when compared to the series. However, when the movie was released, I wasn't able to watch it until it came out on dvd. If I HAD seen it when it first came out, the series wouldn't have been so progressed at the time and so I doubt I would have had this complaint. <br>
    <br>
    I enjoyed this movie overall. It certainly fit the feel of Naruto that has built up over the many episodes of the series, but it didn't feel very ambitious in content. This movie could have easily been 3-4 episodes put back to back to make a mini saga in the series - for a movie I think something more radical and on a larger scale needs to take place in order to satisfy the hype - simply finishing with a Rasengan as a climax seems a bit dated now. Even if they simply had the appearence of the Giant Toad dude somewhere in the movie, it would have sufficed to make the movie exponentially more pleasureable. However, it still contained enough of that vital something-something that hit the spot only Naruto seems to be able to do. Watch it, preferably between watching episodes 96-132 of the series. If you have the option, definately hold off watching episode 133 until after you've watched the movie. You'll see why if you do. </td></tr>
