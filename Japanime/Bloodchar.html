<td>A loner expelled from human society as well as the domain of beasts,paying heed to no one, beholden to no one - this beautiful nocturnal creature simply roams the darkness, bringing about a cruel destiny to all those who cross her path. Only undying legends will forever capture the tale of this accursed creature.

<tr>
<td>It is speculated that chiropterans, with hollow bones and skin that can expand and shrink at will, are able to change form through a distention of their blood vessels. This ability has enabled some of them to take on human form and live covertly among other humans. It has been said that the legend of vampires evolved in various parts from the haphazard sightings of these creatures in their original form. In the evolution from anthropoid to man, some also believe that these blood-sucking anthropoid 'chiropterans' took a diverging path; however, their true identity is unclear.

</table><br><table><h2>Eternal Life Project</h2><br><br>
<tr>
<td>In 1806, a book listed in the inheritance inventory of a prominent family was discovered. While the book suggests plans for creating a being possessing eternal life through combining human and vampire blood, it is not known whether or not this plan was indeed carried out. Some claim that this book contains a list of chiropterans, and others claim that the chiropterans are the result of the project to create beings of mixed human and vampire blood. At the present time, anything is possible.
