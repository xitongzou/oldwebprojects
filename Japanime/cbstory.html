Spike Speagle, a bounty hunter who has escaped from a major crime syndicate called the Red Dragons by fakeing his own death, is now trying to live his life as a Cowboy (bounty hunter). He teams up with a man named Jet Black, and they travel the solar system taking in as much bounties as they can to make a living, no matter what they are, but will Spikes past come back to haunt him? Along with a sly bounty hunter named Faye Valentine, and a hacker kid that goes by the alias "Edward", Spike and the crew of the Bebop are thrown into many odd and risky situations, and are constantly risking lives, all for a bit of cash.
