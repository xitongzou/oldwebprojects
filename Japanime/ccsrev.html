<h3>Cardcaptors Review (reviewed by animetric.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>Cardcaptor Sakura won't bore you with the usual lengthy magical girl transformations. The heroine does more than just pose and use fancy paraphernalia. Cardcaptor Sakura also gives you a nice portion of humor and comical situations. There is also a love angle in the series despite Sakura's young age, and some faint hints of homosexuality can be seen. A possible flaw to all this is the rather repetitive "card of the day" theme. More mature fans may find Cardcaptor Sakura a bit too childish as well. 

The art and animation are predominantly cutesy in style but exquisitely done. I think this series showcases some of Clamp's best art yet. Gone are Clamp's trademark severely drawn eyes (see Magic Knight Rayearth, RG Veda, and X). Cardcaptor Sakura characters are markedly milder and more amiable-looking. A new battle costume is also featured every episode, thanks to Sakura's best friend and couturier Tomoyo. Cardcaptor Sakura characters actually change clothes a lot, which is interesting for me. The songs and music are cute, and complements the series perfectly. Yes, Cardcaptor Sakura is a cutesy magical girl series... but it's a good one at that.
