<h3>Evangelion Review (reviewed by animetric.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>Undoubtedly one of the most popular anime series in existence, Neon Genesis Evangelion is everything I've heard of and more. 

The plot is very powerful and gripping. I couldn't stop watching as soon as I popped the first DVD in the player. In the face of a whole lot of technological impossibilities, the whole scenario exudes a very realistic feel that is almost frightening. 

Characterization is at a very high level. Despite the large cast, there are no ornamental characters. Everyone has a distinct personality and purpose -- not just the Eva pilots. The art and animation are superb, and nothing short of first rate. Every aspect of a scene is drawn and composed perfectly. The English dubbing is basically okay, but I disliked Shinji's and Asuka's voices. Shinji sounds like a total wuss, and I could not stand Asuka's pronounciation of "Eva". The Japanese voices should not be missed! The ultra-versatile Megumi Ogata (also Princess Emeraude in "Magic Knight Rayearth") is the voice of Shinji, the ultra-popular Megumi Hayashibara (also Faye Valentine in "Cowboy Bebop") is Rei, and Sailormoon herself Kotono Mitsuishi plays the pilots' mentor Major Misato Katsuragi. 

If there is a flaw anywhere in the series, I'd say it would have to be the last two episodes. For starters they don't do anything except show a lot of flashbacks and text, while trying to get into the whole existential philosophy deal. You don't know what happens to everybody after all that either. Methinks you have to watch the Eva movies "Death and Rebirth" and "End of Evangelion" for any sense of closure. A five-star anime series nonetheless, Evangelion gets you thinking about a lot of what if's... and if you ponder long enough you may just feel a little shiver down your spine.
