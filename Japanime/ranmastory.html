Ranma Saotome and his father, Genma, show up at the Tendou dojo after a journey to China. There, the two had fallen into cursed springs. Whatever died in those springs is what Ranma and Genma will turn into. Ranma turns into a girl while his father becomes a panda. However the transition only takes place if they come in contact with cold water. And hot water reverses it. But that is only one of Ranma's many problems. His father and Mr. Tendou make a deal that has Ranma and Akane, Mr. Tendo's youngest daughter, both get married so they can take over the family dojo. Until then, they remain engaged and unhappy.
