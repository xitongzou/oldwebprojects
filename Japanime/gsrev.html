<h3>Gundam Seed Review (reviewed by animenfo.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>WOW!!! I didn't like it at first, but as I kept watching till like the 15th episode, I can't stop! The story even runs in my sleep. This is the BEST Gundam ever. The animation is pretty good. I just didn't like the animation when light flashes everywhere during a far caption of the battles. I like how they connect the ending song to the end of the episode. It amazes me how it always fits. I also like all the intro and ending songs. Not to mention Lacus Clyne's songs. The story is very emotional compared to Wing. Wing shows almost no emotion, which is quite unrealistic in wars. I like the twist in the end. The deaths of many characters were quite dissapointing while watching those scenes and a few episodes after, but the deaths was a major ingredient in the story. I failed in holding back the tears in my eyes. I HATE Frey. She gets on my nerves, but an annoying character can spice up the story. I like how Kira and Athrun's personality changed. I also like Lacus's personality, always being calm, peaceful, and understanding; Ramius' emotional yet strong character; Natarle's strong and strict personality; and Mwu's cheerfulness. This anime is sooo worth spending your time into. <p>
