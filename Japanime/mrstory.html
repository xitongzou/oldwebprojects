Monster Rancher is the story of a boy named Genki who is teleported into his favorite video game. Upon his arrival he runs into Holly and Suezo. After Genki unlocked Mocchi, Genki learns what the monster rancher world is all about. All of them soon become friends and Genki joins them on their quest for the Phoenix. The bad guy in the show is Moo. Moo is an evil monster who is turning all the good monsters into bad ones (baddies). The Phoenix is a monster and it is said that when the Phoenix rises, all the bad monsters will become good monsters and all the lost disks will become monsters again. Genki and crew are searching for the disk that the Phoenix is locked in. You see, in the monster rancher world, monsters have to be unlocked from mystery disks and then if they are badly damaged they become lost disks. 


Later on in the story the team joins up with Golem, Tiger, and Hare. Together they are the only ones with enough guts to fight Moo. In their search for the Phoenix, new friends are made, secrets are revealed as the monster world’s greatest adventure unfolds.
