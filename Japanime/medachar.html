<h2>Ikki Tenryou</h2><br><br>
<tr><td><img src="http://www.animeadmirer.com/mbimgs/ikki.jpg" alt="" height="200" width="150"></td>
<td>Ikki is an intelligent, outgoing boy who loves 
Medabots. Unfortunately, he was unable to get one 
until he was able to save enough money. One day he 
found a very rare medal in the river and this changed 
everything. 

Ikki and Metabee don't always agree, but they are 
there for each other when needed.

</table><br><table><h2>Erika</h2><br><br>
<tr><td><img src="http://www.animeadmirer.com/mbimgs/arika.jpg" alt="" height="200" width="150"></td>
<td>Erika is a very strong-minded girl who is 
always in search of a good story for her school 
newspaper. She is also a good childhood friend 
of Ikki's even though she can be quite bossy. 

Erika's medabot Brass is always looking out for 
her. 

</td></tr><p>
</table><br><table><h2>Henry</h2><br><br>
<tr><td><img src="http://www.animeadmirer.com/mbimgs/henry.jpg" alt="" height="200" width="150"></td>
<td>Henry is the teenager who works in a convenience 
store by day. However, his ultra ego is the 
Phantom Renegade who, by night, collects rare 
medabot medals. He knows all there is to know 
about medabots, because 10 years ago, he was the 
star of the World Robattle Tournament with his 
Hercules Beetle-type Medabot. 

He has another ultra ego...a.k.a. Space 
Medabotter X (or phantom renegade). 
</td></tr>
</table><br><table><h2>Koji</h2><br><br>
<tr><td><img src="http://www.animeadmirer.com/mbimgs/koji.jpg" alt="" height="200" width="150"></td>
<td>Koji is your spoiled little rich boy. He 
considers Karin his girlfriend and gets very 
jealous when others (especially Ikki) pay 
attention to her. 

His medabot Samillidon is very tough, but Koji has enough 
honor not to take advantage of anyone
 </td></tr>
</table><br><table><h2>Karin</h2><br><br>
<tr><td><img src="http://www.animeadmirer.com/mbimgs/karin.jpg" alt="" height="200" width="150"></td>
<td>Sweet and innocent Karin seems to be the object of 
many boys affection. She is generous and kind to 
everyone. She is also the heir to a fortune and 
attends a private school. Koji thinks of her as his 
girlfriend and is very protective. 

Because Karin's medabot has the special healing power, it has never lost a robattle and is considered a legend. 

</td></tr>
</table><br><table><h2>Samantha</h2><br><br>
<tr><td><img src="http://www.animeadmirer.com/mbimgs/samantha.jpg" alt="" height="200" width="150"></td>
<td>Samantha is your basic tomboy. Because she is 
so tough, she is considered the leader of the 
screws (a group that includes her,spyke and sloan). She bullies Ikki frequently and has a very feisty electric-type medabot named Peppercat.
