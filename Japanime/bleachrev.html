<h3>Bleach Review (reviewed by ABIDB.net)</h3><br><br><pre>
<p>Although I am not good at making reviews, I will try my luck one more time. 
At the moment I am writing this review I have seen 19 episodes, in my opinion enough to review this title.

Animation:
Although I needed some time to get used to the overall style of this title, I like it pretty much. 
The animation is well done. The way they change the color blend to some sort of color burn or something 
when ichigo becomes a death god captures the gloomy feeling that Ichigo is in the spirit world at that 
moment very well. Although the overall hollow design is quite nice, every hollow looks pretty much like 
the other hollow. The animation used for the opening theme is not very good, since it looks to perky 
compared to the anime itself. Most of the fight scenes, which play an important role in this anime,
 are not done very well. Most of the time they end before they even started by Ichigo, who kills 
 the enemy with a few swings, making most battles pretty much the same. Fortunately, the battles 
 get better when the story progresses, introducing new powers to the battles.

Sound:
The sound is pretty well done. The voices are well done and I liked the sound effects. 
When somenone is screaming it really gave me the feeling they were screaming out of pain and agony. 
The soundtrack really does a good job at some moments, to strengthen the gloomy feel of the anime,
but most of the time it goes by unnoticed. I cant really put it into words how I think of the opening 
and ending themes, but generally they use rap songs (if I can call it that) and the songs itself
sound neutral, not too happy but not to dark either. 

Story:
The story starts out pretty much the same as a normal action based anime. The main character 
must defeat an enemy and gets a mysterious power to do so and everyone is amazed at how strong he is.
However, when the story starts to develop (which happens pretty quick) it turns out to be a promising 
story in which I think will be many plot twists. The hollows are explained very well, the story 
follows a logical line (with new thing introduced when needed without making it too hard to understand)
and questions about the soul society as well as Ichigo which arise when the story progresses makes 
it all the more interesting. 

Character:
The characters (at least most of them) are done very nicely and the most important ones are
introduced in the beginning of the story. Most of the characters have an interesting background
story and the makers did a really good job making you want to know more about them. The characters
also seem to change as the story progresses by learning from their experiences, making them all
the more interesting. 

Value:
Right now as things are progressing I think I would love to watch it a second time. In my point of 
view this is definately one of the better animes that started out in 2004.

Enjoyment:
I am really enjoying the series right now, but then again, I like these kinds of series. 
The thing I like most is when Ichigo either finds out more about his mysterious self 
(or he lets us know somthing about his past) or when Ichigo uses his dorment powers. 
The way the story is progressing, slowly introducing new things without it getting boring,
is great and the characters, who have powers which are not the typical set of powers these animes 
normally have, are also great.
