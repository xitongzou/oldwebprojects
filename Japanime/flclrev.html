<h3>FLCL Review (reviewed by animetric.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>FLCL (also known as "Furi Kuri") may not be one of the most popular anime titles around, but it is very good. It's another product of Gainax (most known for "Neon Genesis Evangelion"), and Production I.G. (creator of "Blood: The Last Vampire"). FLCL's bizarre plot is hard to review and admittedly not for everybody. The events are surreal, and things move at a very frantic pace. Those who prefer dramatically unfolding sagas may want to look elsewhere. While FLCL is primarily hand-drawn, it is also enhanced with computer graphics -- making it a stunning visual masterpiece. Anime and manga-style scenes are mixed together (as is the case with Gainax's "Karekano").This 6-episode OAV series is just beautiful. It does not only excel in the visual aspect, the music is equally superb. In fact, one of the main reasons I watched FLCL is the music -- created by the J-rock band, The Pillows. The sound style fits FLCL perfectly. FLCL is quick and fun to watch -- leaving you craving for for more. All I'm going to say is this: watch it. You won't be disappointed. FLCL has already been picked up for a US release by Synch-Point, so the official English version will be available very soon.
