<h3>Beyblade Review (reviewed by gamepro.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>BeyBlade can be considered the ultimate anime toy tie-in series. It contains all the classic formulas toy sponsored anime series directors have learned over the thirty years of subliminal marketing. The over-energetic main character, his entourage of helpful friends, enemies who turn friends, and the catchy toy fad of the moment formulas are all present in this series. Even with all this set against it, BeyBlade is actually far more enjoyable to watch than comparable toy-inspired series for kids. The show is very character driven, and the BeyBlades themselves don’t outshine the characters as in other shows like Pokémon or Yu-Gi-Oh, where the whole show revolves around the products. 

Unfortunately, BeyBlade has gotten the “anime is for children” treatment. The dialogue has been severely altered, although the episode plots seam to have remained the same. Since the series is considered for children, there is an unfortunate absence of a Japanese audio track, which hurts this DVD. The transfer is mediocre with some blur between fast moving images. 

Although thoroughly enjoyable, BeyBlade is a children's show with a toy manufacturer backing it up. For it’s genre, BeyBlade is well crafted and compares well with Meda-Bots, and Monster Rancher anime series in terms of plot and story development. Plus you get an extra episode in this introductory edition of the series. If you got kids, and want them to watch non-violent anime, BeyBlade is the perfect series for you. Otherwise, just watch Yu-Gi-Oh or Medabots for all the wholesome destruction and catchy visual effects.
