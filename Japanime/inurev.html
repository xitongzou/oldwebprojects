<h3>Inu Yasha Review (reviewed by animelabs.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>Yup, InuYasha is one of the greatest animes ever. But really overated. Adult Swim says its for ages 18 and up, when it's fine for ages 12 and up. I mean sure there's a lot of violence and swear and occasional nudity, but it's not so bad as to saying it's for 18-year-olds. How do I know this? Because most of the people I know who watch these shows are between ages 12-15! COME ON! 

InuYasha is great subbed or dubbed. Some of the voice acting in the dubbed is horrible though. The voice actors of Sango, Miroku, and Kikyo have no expression or feeling in them. Kagome's voice actor REALLY didn't need to do an annoying, preppy valley girl voice. Shippo needed a little kid to do his voice. They should've chosen Daveigh Chase (who was the voice of Lilo in "Lilo and Stitch", Chihiro in "Spirited Away", and played the murderous Samara in "The Ring") to voice act for him. She is excellent. Shippo has the most kawaii voice in the Japanese version! I think the best voice actor would have to be Richard Cox who voice acts InuYasha. He does a flawless "ticked off" voice, and just sounds like InuYasha. 

The story line seems to drag at the first two or three episodes, but it slowly makes progress. Though they skipped some stories and scenes from the manga, it was quite faithful to it. I mean, come on, do you think Card Captor Sakura was faithful to the manga? NO. The idea of it was well-thought-up. Come on, could YOU think up something like this? Takahashi remains faithful to Japan in the Feudal times, but adds some of the Japanese myth and religon in to make it even better. 

Overall, InuYasha really is an enchanting show. After each episode, you really wish more and more that you could become one of the InuYasha characters and go on adventures and such. This is a must-see for any anime fan.<P>
<h3>Anime Rating:</h3> 9.4/10
