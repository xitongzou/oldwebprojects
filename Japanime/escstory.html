One day while she was running to beat time in order to win her first kiss from Amano (her crush), a bright light came from above and a dragon and a young man entered her world through it . She was with her best friend Yukari and Aman when this occurred, but it was only she that could understand what the Young man was saying. The young man defeated the dragon and was once again swallowed by the light, however, Hitomi joined him for the ride. 

Having landed in Gaia, Hitomi learns that the arrogant young man before her is Van Fanel, heir to the Throne of Fanelia.

Van and Hitomi escaped using Escaflowne and Van is hellbent, to say the least, to avenge his fallen country.
