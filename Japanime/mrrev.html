<h3>Monster Rancher Review (reviewed by animeNfo.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>Wow it's amazing how spoiled people are for anime. But let's put aside my 'personal' opinions and get on with the story.
It's like Pokemon and Digimon in a way, but lucky enough they don't evolve into bigger powerful monsters(I think, it's been a while since I last saw it). The plot is kind of new, but has that old concept feel to it; boy in game, saves girl, get's monster(usually the most powerful), bad guy summoning something more evil then evil itself. It's old and used a lot, but kids seem to like it, like how we like action and ecchi.
I like it a lot, of course I like Digimon(mainly the 3rd season, the other two were so-so) and Pokemon(the beginning that is) too. <p>
<h3>Anime Rating:</h3> 5.6/10
