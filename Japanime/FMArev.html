<h3>FMA Review (reviewed by animenfo.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>FMA is a delightfully unique fantasy set in a world of alchemy. Excellent plot dvelopment keeps you glued to the screen and asking for more. FMA boldly delves into complex conflicts regarding forbidden alchemy, comparable to the ethics regarding where to draw the line in today's genetic bio-experimentations.

The animation is top notch, and the animation style also gives the characters longer faces and fuller jaws... not the big-eyes-pointed-chin but also not quite the square jaws from the justice league. FMA uses popular J-Pop (or more accurately, J-Rock as opening themes and Hip Hop from the likes of Crystal K and Sowelu for end themes). The music is definitely chosen in good taste, not the corny, cheesy J-pop at all. The story is the mainstay of FMA, and develops skillfully and full of mystery. FMA plays with the elements to the story well, and has built a very clever alchemy world theory into its core. The characters are likable, but I would have liked a little more angst and darkness at times. I truly enjoyed this tv anime series, all 51 episodes, but have left the value points at 8 because I wonder how much rewatch value there is when I know the plot secrets already. After all, plot was the driving force of this anime, in my mind.
