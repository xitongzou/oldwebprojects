It is 1945, and Japan is on the virge of invasion by US forces. Incendiary bombs dropped by American bombers set fire to the paper towns of Japan in an attempt to demoralize the Japanese people. 14-year-old Seita is not afraid. His father is an officer in the Japanese Navy, and his mother and sister, Setsuko, are safe on Japanese soil. But when the incendiary canisters begin to fall on his town, his attitude changes. His mother, badly burned in the firebombing, dies from her wounds and Seita must take care of his little sister. With only the scant possessions he could salvage from the ashes of his home, Seita travels to a nearby town to stay with his aunt. However, the loss of his mother and the difficulties of trying to take care of his sister begin to wear him down. Seita becomes depressed and shows no interest in working, only spending time with his sister. This begins to anger his aunt, and eventually Seita takes his 4-year-old sister with him as he leaves his aunt's home. This marks further decline in their lives. The Americans are not frightening to Seita, but starvation and illness are. He has run out of food and is forced to steal to feed himself and his sister. Setsuko begins to show signs of severe illness. There is no one to turn to, no one to help them.
<p><strong>Editorial Overview:</strong>
<p> Isao Takahata's powerful antiwar film has been praised by critics wherever it has been screened around the world. When their mother is killed in the firebombing of Tokyo near the end of World War II, teenage Seita and his little sister Setsuko are left on their own: their father is away, serving in the Imperial Navy. The two children initially stay with an aunt, but she has little affection for them and resents the time and money they require. The two children set up housekeeping in a cave by a stream, but their meager resources are quickly exhausted, and Seita is reduced to stealing to feed his sister.

<p>The strength of <em>Grave of the Fireflies </em> lies in Takahata's evenhanded portrayal of the characters. A sympathetic doctor, the greedy aunt, the disinterested cousins all know there is little they can do for Seita and Setsuko. Their resources, like their country's, are already overtaxed: anything they spare endangers their own survival. As in the <em>Barefoot Gen </em> films, no mention is made of Japan's role in the war as an aggressor; but the depiction of the needless suffering endured by its victims transcends national and ideological boundaries. <em>--Charles Solomon </em></p>
