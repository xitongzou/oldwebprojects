<h3>Escaflowne Review (reviewed by animetric.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>Just after watching the enchanting opening sequence, I had a feeling that this was going to be one fabulous anime. I was right. To date, The Vision of Escaflowne is one of the best series I had ever experienced. That's right. It's more than just an audio-visual treat, it's an experience. Things develop at an exciting pace, and there's a good balance of just about every single element that makes an anime great -- fighting action (both mecha and non-mecha), romance, humor, magic... You won't let you feel the 26 episodes pass by because there is never a dull moment in VoE. Every episode is packed, yet despite everything that's happening, viewers won't get lost because the story is very clear. Character development is at a high level as well. There are no ornamental characters, everyone has a distinct personality and purpose in the story. The characters also exude a realistic feel: they are capable of being selfish, dishonest, and illogical... like actual people. Viewers will find it easy to identify with them. 

Visually speaking, VoE will blow you away. From the character renditions to the magnificent mecha action, the art and animation are nothing short of superb. Some of the scenes are even enhanced with a bit of computer wizardry. The musical scoring and the songs are exquisite, effectively enhancing the mood swings of the plot. VoE was originally a 26-episode TV series in Japan, fortunately, it's now officially available on video and on DVD! Impactful and memorable, VOE is one of my all time favorite anime series.
