<h3>Blood: The Last Vampire Review (reviewed by Animetric.com)</h3><br><br>
<p> Blood: The Last Vampire is a highly anticipated release from Production IG, who also brought us "Ghost in the Shell" and "Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade". 

Blood opens with a subway scene featuring Saya and an unidentified man. Saya unsheaths her samurai sword and makes short work of the man... who is supposedly one of "them". Now the "them" we are talking about are the Chiropterans -- grotesque and bloodthirsty creatures who devour humans. But you wouldn't even know they were Chiropterans unless you go to the official website because they are simply referred to as "demons" in the film. It's Saya's job to dispose of these creatures, for only she has the superhuman strength and speed needed to do so... being the "last remaining original". She then gets assigned to a school where Chiropterans are reportedly lurking about, and this particular mission is what makes up the rest of the film.

Saya is a very enigmatic character. She comes and goes whenever she pleases, and she hardly ever talks. You never know what she's thinking, and you can't even offer a guess. All that seems to matter to Saya is the job at hand -- which is getting rid of Chiropterans. She does avoid the crucifix, and the last part shows a faded picture of Saya with the word VAMPIRE typed on top of it so I think it's safe to assume that Saya is the last remaining original vampire (hey, even the title says so).

The art and animation are superb, albeit I found some portions of the film a tad too dark. Scenes and characters are rendered in great detail, and the movements are as smooth as flowing water. I was expecting blood and gore galore but surprisingly, I wasn't the least bit perturbed by the violence. Yes, there is a lot of blood but it doesn't get so gory that you'd see somebody's entrails hanging... just blood and more blood. 

I liked Blood: The Last Vampire. It's short, sweet, and straight to the point. It's not talky like "Ghost in the Shell" or "Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade", so there's very little chance that you'd get bored. While some may find its conclusion unsatisfying, I found it just fitting for one such as Saya.
