The anime series is based around a young boy named Yugi and a gift that his grandfather, Solomon, gave him called the Millenium Puzzle. As the story starts to unfold, the origin of the Millenium Puzzle is revealed, as well as the existence of the six other Millenium items. During this time, a new card game is starting to go big. This is the Duel Monsters card game created by Pegasus J. Crawford (English name: Maximillion Pegasus). After being lured into the tournament by Pegasus, Yugi goes through major obstacles, dueling through the tournament and eventually winning.

Yu-Gi-Oh! also details around Yugi's main rival, the Duel Monsters world champion, Seto Kaiba. In the very first episode, Kaiba challenges and defeats Yugi's grandfather in a duel where each of their rarest cards were on the line. The virtual reality dueling system takes Solomon by surprise, and he loses. When Yugi shows up, Yami Yugi (English name: Dark Yugi) makes his first appearance and defeats Kaiba starting the whole chain of events that would lead to Pegasus' and Yugi's final confrontation at the end of the Duelist Kingdom story arc.

The anime is currently still showing in Japan and has reached around the 120th episode. Yu-Gi-Oh! is divided into two main story arcs with some side stories in between. The first is the Duelist Kingdom Story Arc with Pegasus starting up the Duelist Kingdom tournament. The second is the Battle City Story Arc in which Kaiba receives one of the three god cards and starts his own tournament called Battle City. Instead of Pegasus as the villain, Marik shows up and steps in that part of the story. Battle City is divided into three main parts, the Battle City, Battle Ship, and then Duel Tower (finals).
