<p><strong>Ninja Scroll </strong></p>
<p> By now, if you haven&rsquo;t heard of Ninja Scroll, then you&rsquo;ve either been living in a cave in the Sahara Desert for the past twenty years, or you are unfamiliar with the country of Japan as a whole. In any case, for the last ten years, Ninja Scroll has served as a &lsquo;gateway drug&rsquo; to the world of anime. Nine times out of ten, if you talk to any given otaku, they&rsquo;ll tell you one of the first anime titles they saw was Ninja Scroll. Given the sheer volume of anime available on today&rsquo;s market, for a title to have that kind of recognition is special; this film, love it or hate it, is a permanent addition to anime culture in America, alongside Akira and Ghost in the Shell. 
<p><strong>Editorial Overview: </strong>
<table>
  <tr><td valign="top"> A peak achievement of Japanese animation (anime), a propulsive mix of samurai action adventure and supernatural fantasy from writer-director Yoshiaki Kawajiri ( <em>Supernatural Best City </em>). This is defiantly animation for grown-ups, complete with fountains of blood, plenty of naked flesh, and (in both the subtitled and dubbed versions) some decidedly strong language. (Students of Japanese language could pick up some useful expressions.) The plot sounds like a 16th century variation on the <em>X-Files </em>: An entire village has been wiped out by a mysterious plague and an anti-government conspiracy of invulnerable demons seems to be responsible. A wandering ninja, Jubei, and his female counterpart, Kagero, team up to defeat the plotters. Jubei is a classic reluctant hero, agreeing to participate in the mission only after being fed a slow-acting poison; the antidote will be supplied after he cooperates. And Kagero, a looker whose embrace is lethal, is a femme fatale with a difference that seems distinctively Japanese: sexual contact itself is poisonous, especially for a warrior with a pure-soul. <em>--David Chute </em><em>--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title. </em> </td></tr>
