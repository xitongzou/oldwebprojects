<h3>Naruto Review (reviewed by animelab.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>This show ,by Masashi Kishimoto, has got to be the most heart wrenching and beautiful story I have ever heard. I know this is the best anime will ever get. The characters seem to have real souls poured into them and the art is is just wonderful! 
Every charcter on this show seems to have deep emotions and the story itself is breath taking! I can't believe such an anime could be created! The sadness of Naruto wanting to be noticed whom is reduced to class room clown, Sakura who can not win the love of her life and finally finds she can't allways let others protect her, Sasuke who's brother Itachi killed his own parents now becoming a demon's slave with that bite on his nack and seems to have feelings for Naruto, Zabuza who finds little Haku on the streets as an orphan taking him in out of some sort of sorrow when Haku tells him they are alike, and Haku who lives only to kill just so no one will get in the way of his , I'm assuming love, Zabuza's plans. Just a few of the beautifully created characters from the world of Naruto. 
If you ever have the desire to see an anime you have never seen in your life before. Naruto is the best bet. 

<h3>Anime Rating:</h3> 8.8/10
