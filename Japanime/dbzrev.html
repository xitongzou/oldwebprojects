<h3>DBZ Review (reviewed by excelsis.com)</h3><br><br>
<p>I felt that the storylines were better at the beginning of the show while the art was terrible, whereas at the end of the show, the art was great and the characters had actually become interesting, but the storylines were too repetitive when you got up somewhere around the 150-episode mark.
Still, the strange thing about DBZ is, on any given day, I can watch it, whether it's on Toonami or the International Channel. It's simple enough that you don't really have to know what's going on to get drawn in, and somehow it manages to be entertaining enough to keep you watching it.
Still, I hate having to watch every single character, one at a time, show up on screen in shock every single the bad guy of the season shows a new technique. If they would just have the decency to be like most series and do a split-screen thing, this show would probably be 2 hours shorter. And if they cut out the amount of time spent between two opponents staring down, it'd probably be 6-10 hours shorter. (About 290 episodes at 20 minutes each equals 5800 minutes, or disturbingly close to 100 hours.)
And what really gets me is that the minor characters were barely able to do anything in the show from the beginning to the end. Piccolo, Krillin, and Tien couldn't do a thing against Vegeta, Piccolo could barely do anything to Freezer and Krillin was killed by him pretty fast, Yamcha and Krillin and Tien didn't stand a chance against 17 and 18 and Piccolo was having a hard enough time fighting just 17 even after he'd fused with Kami, Yamcha and Krillin and Piccolo and Tien combined were nothing to Cell, and nobody who wasn't a saiyajin could even scratch Buu. That'd all be okay except that they keep those minor characters around for literally hundreds of episodes and for the most part, they're completely worthless and you have to just sit and watch them getting beaten around over and over and over.
But anyway, if you don't mind the fact that the minor characters are generally pretty worthless to the plot, and if you like fighting, go ahead and watch. It's no Rurouni Kenshin in terms of quality, but there's something compelling about it that just makes you want to watch.
I sort of recommend this series - After all, I think we should all give in, stop being critics, and just let ourselves enjoy a show once in a while.<P>
