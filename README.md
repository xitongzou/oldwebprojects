Older Web Projects
==============

This is a collection of older websites I have created or worked on. 

I’ve been a website designer since I was 12. The first website I designed was dedicated to Dragonball Z and was called ‘Tong Zou’s DBZ Domain’, a very typical name for a website for a 12 year old. The second website I designed was called DBZ Fantasy. It’s actually still functional, quite incredible since it was designed back in 2002. I also started other websites devoted to some of my favorite games (a DOS game called Liero and a SNES game called Chrono Trigger) as well as an anime resource site (called Japanime). I also have my previous web portfolio design below.

I was appointed the webmaster for the UTFOCUS website. I was in charge of uploading pictures into the picture gallery, updating the site with new information and revising all the pages for the school year of 2007-2008. I was in charge of daily maintenance and organizing the layouts.

I’ve also worked on The Newspaper‘s website, an independent UofT newspaper (which I used Flash for the banner).

I also help develop AIESEC Toronto‘s internal website, which I served as the Social Media Manager in charge of integrating Google Calendar, Facebook and Twitter feeds and updating the website. It was completely done in WordPress and I also managed the look and feel and plugins for the website.

Technologies used:
==============
I used a variety of relatively new technologies back then. I used DHTML which was popular at the time (it would later evolve into AJAX), Javascript, PHP and the usual HTML/CSS for my early websites. My previous portfolio used simple AJAX and CSS.

Responsibilities/Roles
==============
I functioned as the webmaster, programmer and graphics artist for these websites, as it was entirely done in my spare time. Alot of the Javascript was taken from external resources such as Dynamic Drive and HTMLGear.

Project details
==============
Alot of my early websites were essentially ‘shrine sites’ dedicated to something I liked. I am also an anime lover and so I created a graphics design site called Japanime which focused on providing anime resources such as history, characters and biography of over 50 animes.
