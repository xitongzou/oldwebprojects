  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">About me:</span><br />
    My name is Tong Zou, and I am a third-year student currently attending the University of Toronto. I am specializing in software engineering and minoring in economics, and I hope experience from my studies will permit me to adequately apply my skillset to the working environment, be it web design or database management or software development. I have big ambitions and have a tendency to look at the big picture instead of the individual parts; I believe the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. I value experience and grades more than anything else and work well both independently and as part of a team, having done several team projects before. My hobbies include music and a thirst for knowledge which usually leads me to pursue history and philosophy in earnest. I am very hopeful and optimistic about the future, sometimes very obstinate in giving up on things. My work ethic lends itself to this aspect; I usually have a hard time starting, but once I have started, I can usually work without fail until I finish. <span style="font-weight: bold;">I believe that success comes with hard work, and although life is merely a string of your successes, in the end your accomplishments will be worth the effort. </span> <br />
